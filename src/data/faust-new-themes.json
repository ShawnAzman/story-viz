O, then,\nWhat precious stuff they dish, and call't a book,\nYour stomach turns at the first look;\nA heap of rubbish, and a lumber room,\nAt best some great state farce with proclamations,\nPragmatic maxims, protocols, orations,\nSuch as from puppet-mouths do fitly come!\nWagner.\nBut then the world!--the human heart and mind!\nSomewhat of this to know are all inclined.\nFaust.\nYes! as such knowledge goes! but what man dares\nTo call the child by the true name it bears?\nThe noble few that something better knew,\nAnd to the gross reach of the general view,\nTheir finer feelings bared, and insight true,\nFrom oldest times were burnt and crucified.\nI do beseech thee, friend--'tis getting late,\n'Twere wise to put an end to our debate.\nWagner.\nSuch learned talk to draw through all the night\nWith Doctor Faust were my supreme delight;\nBut on the morrow, being Easter, I\nYour patience with some questions more may try.\nWith zeal I've followed Learning's lofty call,\nMuch I have learned, but fain would master all.

[_alone_]\nStrange how his pate alone hope never leaves,\nWho still to shallow husks of learning cleaves!\nWith greedy hand who digs for hidden treasure,\nAnd, when he finds a grub, rejoiceth above measure!\nDurst such a mortal voice usurp mine ear\nWhen all the spirit-world was floating near?\nYet, for this once, my thanks are free,\nThou meanest of earth's sons, to thee!\nThy presence drew me back from sheer despair,\nAnd shock too keen for mortal nerve to bear;\nAlas! so giant-great the vision came,\nThat I might feel me dwarf, ev'n as I am.\nI, God's own image that already seemed\nTo gaze where Truth's eternal mirror gleamed,\nAnd, clean divested of this cumbering clay,\nBasked in the bliss of heaven's vivific ray;\nI, more than cherub, with fresh pulses glowing,\nWho well nigh seemed through Nature's deep veins flowing\nLike a pure god, creative virtue knowing,\nWhat sharp reproof my hot presumption found!\nOne word of thunder smote me to the ground.\nAlas! 'tis true! not I with thee and thine\nMay dare to cope! the strength indeed was mine\nTo make thee own my call, but not\nTo chain thee to the charm\u00e8d spot.\nWhen that blest rapture thrilled my frame,\nI felt myself so small, so great;\nBut thou didst spurn me back with shame,\nInto this crazy human state.\nWhere find I aid? what follow? what eschew?\nShall I that impulse of my soul obey?\nAlas! alas! but I must feel it true,\nThe pains we suffer and the deeds we do,\nAre clogs alike in the free spirit's way.\nThe godlike essence of our heaven-born powers\nMust yield to strange and still more strange intrusion;\nSoon as the good things of this world are ours,\nWe deem our nobler self a vain illusion,\nAnd heaven-born instincts--very life of life--\nAre strangled in the low terrestrial strife.\nYoung fancy, that once soared with flight sublime,\nOn venturous vans, ev'n to th' Eternal's throne,\nNow schools her down a little space to own,\nWhen in the dark engulfing stream of time,\nOur fair-faced pleasures perish one by one.\nCare nestles deep in every heart,\nAnd, cradling there the secret smart,\nRocks to and fro, and peace and joy are gone.\nWhat though new masks she still may wear,\nWealth, house and hall, with acres rich and rare,\nAs wife or child appear she, water, flame,\nDagger, or poison, she is still the same;\nAnd still we fear the ill which happens never,\nAnd what we lose not are bewailing ever.\nAlas! alas! too deep 'tis felt! too deep!\nWith gods may vie no son of mortal clay;\nMore am I like to worms that crawl and creep,\nAnd dig, and dig through earth their lightless way,\nWhich, while they feed on dust in narrow room,\nFind from the wanderer's foot their death-blow and their tomb.\nIs it not dust that this old wall\nFrom all its musty benches shows me?\nAnd dust the trifling trumperies all\nThat in this world of moths enclose me?\nHere is it that I hope to find\nWherewith to sate my craving mind?\nNeed I spell out page after page,\nTo know that men in every age\nAnd every clime, have spurred in vain\nThe jaded muscle and the tortured brain,\nAnd here and there, with centuries between,\nOne happy man belike hath been?\nThou grinning skull, what wouldst thou say,\nSave that thy brain, in chase of truth, like mine,\nWith patient toil pursued its floundering way\nBy glimmering lights that through dim twilight-shine?\nYe instruments, in sooth, now laugh at me,\nWith wheel, and cog-wheel, ring, and cylinder;\nAt Nature's door I stood; ye should have been the key,\nBut though your ward be good, the bolt ye cannot stir.\nMysterious Nature may not choose\nTo unveil her secrets to the stare of day,\nAnd what from the mind's eye she stores away,\nThou canst not force from her with levers and with screws.\nThou antique gear, why dost thou cumber\nMy chamber with thy useless lumber?\nMy father housed thee on this spot,\nAnd I must keep thee, though I need thee not!\nThou parchment roll that hast been smoked upon\nLong as around this desk the sorry lamp-light shone;\nMuch better had I spent my little gear,\nThan with this little to sit mouldering here;\nWhy should a man possess ancestral treasures,\nBut by possession to enlarge his pleasures?\nThe thing we use not a dead burden lies,\nBut what the moment brings the wise man knows to prize.\nBut what is this? there in the corner; why\nDoes that flask play the magnet to mine eye?\nAnd why within me does this strange light shine,\nAs the soft nightly moon through groves of sombre pine?\nI greet thee, matchless phial; and with devotion\nI take thee down, and in thy mellow potion\nI reverence human wit and human skill.\nFine essence of the opiate dew of sleep,\nDear extract of all subtle powers that kill,\nBe mine the first-fruits of thy strength to reap!\nI look on thee, and soothed is my heart's pain;\nI grasp thee, straight is lulled my racking brain,\nAnd wave by wave my soul's flood ebbs away.\nI see wide ocean's swell invite my wistful eyes,\nAnd at my feet her sparkling mirror lies;\nTo brighter shores invites a brighter day.\nA car of fire comes hovering o'er my head,\nWith gentle wafture; now let me pursue\nNew flight adventurous, through the starry blue,\nAnd be my wing\u00e8d steps unburdened sped\nTo spheres of uncramped energy divine!\nAnd may indeed this life of gods be mine,\nBut now a worm, and cased in mortal clay?\nYes! only let strong will high thought obey,\nTo turn thy back on the blest light of day,\nAnd open burst the portals which by most\nWith fear, that fain would pass them by, are crossed.\nNow is the time by deeds, not words, to prove\nThat earth-born man yields not to gods above.\nBefore that gloomy cavern not to tremble,\nWhere all those spectral shapes of dread assemble,\nWhich Fancy, slave of every childish fear,\nBids, to the torment of herself, appear;\nForward to strive unto that passage dire,\nWhose narrow mouth seems fenced with hell's collected fire;\nWith glad resolve this leap to make, even though\nThat thing we call our soul should into nothing flow!\nNow come thou forth! thou crystal goblet clear,\nFrom out thy worshipful old case,\nWhere thou hast lain unused this many a year.\nIn days of yore right gayly didst thou grace\nThe festive meetings of my grey-beard sires,",

now I know thy worthy duties all!\nUnable to annihilate wholesale,\nThy mischief now thou workest by retail.\nMephistopheles.\nAnd even thus, my progress is but small.\nThis something, the big lumpish world, which stands\nOpposed to nothing, still ties my hands,\nAnd spite of all the ground that I seem winning,\nRemains as firm as in the beginning;\nWith storms and tempests, earthquakes and burnings,\nEarth still enjoys its evenings and mornings,\nAnd the accurs\u00e8d fry of brute and human clay,\nOn them my noblest skill seems worse than thrown away.\nHow many thousands have I not buried!\nYet still a new fresh blood is hurried\nThrough fresh young veins, that I must sheer despair.\nThe earth, the water, and the air,\nThe moist, the dry, the hot, the cold,\nA thousand germs of life unfold;\nAnd had I not of flame made reservation,\nI had no portion left in the creation.\nFaust.\nAnd thus thou seekest to oppose\nThe genial power, from which all life and motion flows,\nAgainst Existence' universal chain,\nClenching thy icy devil's fist in vain!\nTry some more profitable feats,\nStrange son of Chaos, full of cross conceits.\nMephistopheles.\nThe hint is good, and on occasion,\nMay well deserve consideration;\nMeanwhile, with your good leave, I would withdraw.\nFaust.\nMy leave! do I make devil's law?\nThe liberty, methinks, is all your own.\nI see you here to-day with pleasure,\nGo now, and come back at your leisure.\nHere is the door, there is the window, and\nA chimney, if you choose it, is at hand.\nMephistopheles.\nLet me speak plain! there is a small affair,\nThat, without your assistance, bars my way,\nThe goblin-foot upon the threshold there--\nFaust.\nThe pentagram stands in your way![*n6]\nHa! tell me then, thou imp of sin,\nIf this be such a potent spell\nTo bar thy going out, how cam'st thou in?\nWhat could have cheated such a son of hell?\nMephistopheles.\nLook at it well, the drawing is not true;\nOne angle, that towards the door, you see,\nLeft a small opening for me.\nFaust.\nSo so! for once dame Fortune has been kind,\nAnd I have made a prisoner of you!\nChance is not always blind.\nMephistopheles.\nThe cur sprang in before it looked about;\nBut now the thing puts on a serious air;\nThe devil is in the house and can't get out.\nFaust.\nYou have the window, why not jump out there?\nMephistopheles.\nIt is a law which binds all ghosts and sprites;\nWherever they creep in, there too they must creep out;\nI came in at the door, by the door I must go out.\nFaust.\nSo so! then hell too has its laws and rights,\nThus might one profit by the powers of evil,\nAnd make an honest bargain with the devil.\nMephistopheles.\nThe devil, sir, makes no undue exaction,\nAnd pays what he has promised to a fraction;\nBut this affair requires consideration,\nWe'll leave it for some future conversation.\nFor this time, I beseech your grace,\nLet me be gone; I've work to do.\nFaust.\nStay but one minute, I've scarce seen your face.\nSpeak; you should know the newest of the new.\nMephistopheles.\nI'll answer thee at length some other day;\nAt present, I beseech thee, let me loose.\nFaust.\nI laid no trap to snare thee in the way,\nThyself didst thrust thy head into the noose;\nWhoso hath caught the devil, hold him fast!\nSuch lucky chance returns not soon again.\nMephistopheles.\nIf 'tis your pleasure so, I will remain,\nBut on condition that the time be passed\nIn worthy wise, and you consent to see\nSome cunning sleights of spirit-craft from me.\nFaust.\nThy fancy jumps with mine. Thou may'st commence,\nSo that thy dainty tricks but please the sense.\nMephistopheles.\nThou shalt, in this one hour, my friend,\nMore for thy noblest senses gain,\nThan in the year's dull formal train,\nFrom stale beginning to stale end.\nThe songs the gentle Spirits sing thee,\nThe lovely visions that they bring thee,\nAre not an empty juggling show.\nOn thine ear sweet sounds shall fall,\nOdorous breezes round thee blow,\nTaste, and touch, and senses all\nWith delicious tingling glow.\nNo lengthened prelude need we here,\nSing, Spirit-imps that hover near!\nSpirits.\nVanish ye murky\nOld arches away!\nThrough the cloud curtain\nThat blinds heaven's ray\nMild and serenely\nLook forth the queenly\nEye of the day!\nStar now and starlet\nBeam more benign,\nAnd purer suns now\nSoftlier shine.\nIn beauty ethereal,\nA swift-moving throng,\nOf spirits a\u00ebrial,\nAre waving along,\nAnd the soul follows\nOn wings of desire;\nThe fluttering garlands\nThat deck their attire,\nCover the meadows,\nCover the bowers,\nWhere lovers with lovers\nBreathe rapturous hours.\nBower on bower!\nThe shoots of the vine,\nWith the leaves of the fig-tree,\nTheir tendrils entwine!\nClusters of ripe grapes,\nBright-blushing all,\nInto the wine-press\nHeavily fall;\nFrom fountains divine\nBright rivers of wine\nCome foaming and swirling;\nO'er gems of the purest,\nSparkling and purling,\nThey flow and they broaden\nIn bright vista seen,\nTo deep-bosomed lakes\nLightly fringed with the green,\nWhere leafy woods nod\nIn their tremulous sheen.\nOn light-oaring pinions\nThe birds cut the gale,\nThrough the breezy dominions\nAs sunward they sail;\nThey sail on swift wings\nTo the isles of the blest,\nOn the soft swelling waves\nThat are cradled to rest;\nWhere we hear the glad spirits\nIn jubilee sing,\nAs o'er the green meadows\nFleet-bounding they spring:\nWith light airy footing,\nA numberless throng,\nLike meteors shooting\nThe mountains along;\nSome there are flinging\nTheir breasts to the seas,\nOthers are swinging\nIn undulant ease,\nLovingly twining\nLife's tissue divine,\nWhere pure stars are shining\nIn beauty benign!\nMephistopheles.\nHe sleeps! well done, ye airy urchins! I\nRemain your debtor for this lullaby,\nBy which so bravely ye have sung asleep\nThis restless spirit, who, with all his wit,\nIs not yet quite the man with cunning cast,\nTo hook the devil and hold him fast.\nAround him let your shapes fantastic flit,\nAnd in a sea of dreams his senses steep.\nBut now this threshold's charm to disenchant,\nThe tooth of a rat is all I want;\nNor need I make a lengthened conjuration,\nI hear one scraping there in preparation.\nThe lord of the rats and of the mice,\nOf the flies, and frogs, and bugs, and lice,\nCommands you with your teeth's good saw,\nThe threshold of this door to gnaw!\nForth come, and there begin to file,\nWhere he lets fall this drop of oil.\nHa! there he jumps! that angle there,\nWith thy sharp teeth I bid thee tear,\nWhich jutting forward, sad disaster,\nUnwilling prisoner keeps thy master.\nBriskly let the work go on,\nOne bite more and it is done! [_Exit._\nFaust. [_awakening from his trance_]\nOnce more the juggler Pleasure cheats my lip,\nGone the bright spirit-dream, and left no trace,\nThat I spake with the devil face to face,\nAnd that a poodle dog gave me the slip!\nScene VI.\n/Faust's/ _Study as before._\n/Faust. Mephistopheles./\nFaust.\nWho's there to break my peace once more? come in!\nMephistopheles.\n'Tis I!\nFaust.\nCome in!\nMephistopheles.\nThou must repeat it thrice.\nFaust.\nCome in.\nMephistopheles.\nThus with good omen we begin;\nI come to give you good advice,\nAnd hope we'll understand each other.\nThe idle fancies to expel,\nThat in your brain make such a pother,\nAt your service behold me here,\nOf noble blood, a cavalier,\nA gallant youth rigged out with grace,\nIn scarlet coat with golden lace,\nA short silk mantle, and a bonnet,\nWith a gay cock's feather on it,\nAnd at my side a long sharp sword.\nNow listen to a well-meant word;\nDo thou the like, and follow me,\nAll unembarrassed thus and free,\nTo mingle in the busy scenes\nOf life, and know what living means.\nFaust.\nStill must I suffer, clothe me as you may,\nThis narrow earthly life's incumbrancy;\nToo old I am to be content with play,\nToo young from every longing to be free.\nWhat can the world hold forth for me to gain?\nAbstain, it saith, and still it saith, Abstain!\nThis is the burden of the song\nThat in our ears eternal rings,\nLife's dreary litany lean and long,\nThat each dull moment hoarsely sings.\nWith terror wake I in the morn from sleep,\nAnd bitter tears might often weep,\nTo see the day, when its dull course is run,\nThat brings to fruit not one small wish,--not one!\nThat, with capricious criticising,\nEach taste of joy within my bosom rising,\nEre it be born, destroys, and in my breast\nChokes every thought that gives existence zest,\nWith thousand soulless trifles of an hour.\nAnd when the dark night-shadows lower,\nI seek to ease my aching brain\nUpon a weary couch in vain.\nWith throngs of feverish dreams possessed,\nEven in the home of sleep I find no rest;\nThe god, that in my bosom dwells,\nCan stir my being's inmost wells;\nBut he who sways supreme our finer stuff,\nMoves not the outward world, hard, obdurate, and tough.\nThus my existence is a load of woes,\nDeath my best friend, and life my worst of foes.\nMephistopheles.\nAnd yet methinks this friend you call your best,\nIs seldom, when he comes, a welcome guest.\nFaust.\nOh! happy he to whom, in victory's glance,\nDeath round his brow the bloody laurel winds!\nWhom, 'mid the circling hurry of the dance,\nLocked in a maiden's close embrace he finds;\nO! would to God that I had sunk that night\nIn tranceful death before the Spirit's might!\nMephistopheles.\nYet, on a certain night, a certain man was slow\nTo drink a certain brown potation out.\nFaust.\nIt seems 'tis your delight to play the scout.\nMephistopheles.\nOmniscient am I not; but many things I know.\nFaust.\nIf, in that moment's wild confusion,\nA well-known tone of blithesome youth\nHad power, by memory's dear delusion,\nTo cheat me with the guise of truth;\nThen curse I all whate'er the soul\nWith luring juggleries entwines,\nAnd in this gloomy dungeon-hole\nWith dazzling flatteries confines!\nCurst be 'fore all the high opinion\nThe soul has of its own dominion!\nCurst all the show of shallow seeming,\nThrough gates of sense fallacious streaming!\nCurst be the hollow dreams of fame,\nOf honor, glory, and a name!\nCurst be the flattering goods of earth,\nWife, child, and servant, house and hearth!\nAccursed be Mammon, when with treasures\nTo riskful venture he invites us,\nCurst when, the slaves of passive pleasures,\nOn soft-spread cushions he delights us!\nCurst be the balsam juice o' the grape!\nAccursed be love's deceitful thrall!\nAccursed be Hope! accursed be Faith!\nAccursed be Patience above all!\nChorus of Spirits. [_invisible_]\nWoe! woe!\nThou hast destroyed it!\nThe beautiful world,\nWith mightiest hand,\nA demigod\nIn ruin has hurled!\nWe weep,\nAnd bear its wrecked beauty away,\nWhence it may never\nReturn to the day.\nMightiest one\nOf the sons of earth,\nBrightest one,\nBuild it again!\nProudly resurgent with lovelier birth\nIn thine own bosom build it again!\nLife's glad career\nAnew commence\nWith insight clear,\nAnd purg\u00e8d sense,\nThe while new songs around thee play,\nTo launch thee on more hopeful way!\nMephistopheles.\nThese are the tiny\nSpirits that wait on me;\nHark how to pleasure\nAnd action they counsel thee!\nInto the world wide\nWould they allure thee,\nIn solitude dull\nNo more to immure thee,\nNo more to sit moping\nIn mouldy mood,\nWith a film on thy sense,\nAnd a frost in thy blood!\nCease then with thine own peevish whim to play,\nThat like a vulture makes thy life its prey.\nSociety, however low,\nStill gives thee cause to feel and know\nThyself a man, amid thy fellow-men.\nYet my intent is not to pen\nThee up with the common herd! and though\nI cannot boast, or rank, or birth\nOf mighty men, the lords of earth,\nYet do I offer, at thy side,\nThy steps through mazy life to guide;\nAnd, wilt thou join in this adventure,\nI bind myself by strong indenture,\nHere, on the spot, with thee to go.\nCall me companion, comrade brave,\nOr, if it better please thee so,\nI am thy servant, am thy slave!\nFaust.\nAnd in return, say, what the fee\nThy faithful service claims from me?\nMephistopheles.\nOf that you may consider when you list.\nFaust.\nNo, no! the devil is an Egotist,\nAnd seldom gratis sells his labor,\nFor love of God, to serve his neighbor.\nSpeak boldly out, no private clause conceal;\nWith such as you 'tis dangerous to deal.\nMephistopheles.\nI bind myself to be thy servant here,\nAnd wait with sleepless eyes upon thy pleasure,\nIf, when we meet again in _yonder_ sphere,\nThou wilt repay my service in like measure.\nFaust.\nWhat _yonder_ is I little reck to know,\nProvided I be happy here below;\nThe future world will soon enough arise,\nWhen the present in ruin lies.\n'Tis from this earth my stream of pleasure flows,\nThis sun it is that shines upon my woes;\nAnd, were I once from this my home away,\nThen happen freely what happen may.\nNor hope in me it moves, nor fear,\nIf then, as now, we hate and love;\nOr if in yonder world, as here,\nAn under be, and an above.\nMephistopheles.\nWell, in this humor, you bid fair\nWith hope of good result to dare.\nClose with my plan, and you will see\nAnon such pleasant tricks from me,\nAs never eyes of man did bliss\nFrom father Adam's time to this.\nFaust.\nPoor devil, what hast thou to give,\nBy which a human soul may live?\nBy thee or thine was never yet divined\nThe thought that stirs the deep heart of mankind!\nTrue, thou hast food that sateth never,\nAnd yellow gold that, restless ever,\nLike quicksilver between the fingers,\nOnly to escape us, lingers;\nA game where we are sure to lose our labor,\nA maiden that, while hanging on my breast,\nFlings looks of stolen dalliance on my neighbor;\nAnd honor by which gods are blest,\nThat, like a meteor, vanishes in air.\nShow me the fruit that rots _before_ 'tis broken,\nAnd trees that day by day their green repair!\nMephistopheles.\nA word of mighty meaning thou hast spoken,\nYet such commission makes not me despair.\nBelieve me, friend, we only need to try it,\nAnd we too may enjoy our morsel sweet in quiet.\nFaust.\nIf ever on a couch of soft repose\nMy soul shall rock at ease,\nIf thou canst teach with sweet delusive shows\nMyself myself to please,\nIf thou canst trick me with a toy\nTo say sincerely I /enjoy/,\nThen may my latest sand be run!\nA wager on it!\nMephistopheles.\nDone!\nFaust.\nAnd done, and done!\nWhen to the moment I shall say,\nStay, thou art so lovely, stay!\nThen with thy fetters bind me round,\nThen perish I with cheerful glee!\nThen may the knell of death resound,\nThen from thy service art thou free!\nThe clock may stand,\nAnd the falling hand\nMark the time no more for me!\nMephistopheles.\nConsider well: in things like these\nThe devil's memory is not apt to slip.\nFaust.\nThat I know well; may'st keep thy heart at ease,\nNo random word hath wandered o'er my lip.\nSlave I remain, or here, or there,\nThine, or another's, I little care.\nMephistopheles.\nMy duty I'll commence without delay,\nWhen with the graduates you dine to-day.\nOne thing remains!--black upon white\nA line or two, to make the bargain tight.\nFaust.\nA writing, pedant!--hast thou never found\nA man whose word was better than his bond?\nIs't not enough that by my spoken word,\nOf all I am and shall be thou art lord?\nThe world drives on, wild wave engulfing wave,\nAnd shall a line bind me, if I would be a knave?\nYet 'tis a whim deep-graven in the heart,\nAnd from such fancies who would gladly part?\nHappy within whose honest breast concealed\nThere lives a faith, nor time nor chance can shake;\nYet still a parchment, written, stamped, and sealed,\nA spectre is before which all must quake.\nCommit but once thy word to the goose-feather,\nThen must thou yield the sway to wax and leather.\nSay, devil--paper, parchment, stone, or brass?\nWith me this coin or that will pass;\nStyle, or chisel, or pen shall it be?\nThou hast thy choice of all the three.\nMephistopheles.\nWhat need of such a hasty flare\nOf words about so paltry an affair?\nPaper or parchment, any scrap will do,\nThen write in blood your signature thereto.\nFaust.\nIf this be all, there needs but small delay,\nSuch trifles shall not stand long in my way.\nMephistopheles. [_while Faust is signing the paper_]\nBlood is a juice of most peculiar virtue.\nFaust.\nOnly no fear that I shall e'er demur to\nThe bond as signed; my whole heart swears\nEven to the letter that the parchment bears.\nToo high hath soared my blown ambition;\nI now take rank with thy condition;\nThe Mighty Spirit of All hath scorned me,\nAnd Nature from her secrets spurned me:\nMy thread of thought is rent in twain,\nAll science I loathe with its wranglings vain.\nIn the depths of sensual joy, let us tame\nOur glowing passion's restless flame!\nIn magic veil, from unseen hand,\nBe wonders ever at our command!\nPlunge we into the rush of Time!\nInto Action's rolling main!\nThen let pleasure and pain,\nLoss and gain,\nJoy and sorrow, alternate chime!\nLet bright suns shine, or dark clouds lower,\nThe man that works is master of the hour.\nMephistopheles.\nTo thee I set nor bound nor measure,\nEvery dainty thou may'st snatch,\nEvery flying joy may'st catch,\nDrink deep, and drain each cup of pleasure;\nOnly have courage, friend, and be not shy!\nFaust.\nContent from thee thy proper wares to buy,\nThou markest well, I do not speak of joy,\nPleasure that smarts, giddy intoxication,\nEnamoured hate, and stimulant vexation.\nMy bosom healed from hungry greed of science\nWith every human pang shall court alliance;\nWhat all mankind of pain and of enjoyment\nMay taste, with them to taste be my employment;\nTheir deepest and their highest I will sound,\nWant when they want, be filled when they abound,\nMy proper self unto their self extend,\nAnd with them too be wrecked, and ruined in the end.\nMephistopheles.\nBelieve thou me, who speak from test severe,\nChewing the same hard food from year to year,\nThere lives (were but the naked truth confessed)\nNo man who, from his cradle to his bier,\nThe same sour leaven can digest!\nTrust one of us--this universe so bright,\nHe made it only for his own delight;\nSupreme He reigns, in endless glory shining,\nTo utter darkness me and mine consigning,\nAnd grudges ev'n to you the day without the night.\nFaust.\nBut I will!\nMephistopheles.\nThere you are right!\nOne thing alone gives me concern,\nThe time is short, and we have much to learn.\nThere is a way, if you would know it,\nJust take into your pay a poet;\nThen let the learned gentleman sweep\nThrough the wide realms of imagination\nAnd every noble qualification,\nUpon your honored crown upheap,\nThe strength of the lion,\nThe wild deer's agility,\nThe fire of the south,\nWith the north's durability.\nThen let his invention the secret unfold,\nTo be crafty and cunning, yet generous and bold;\nAnd teach your youthful blood, as poets can,\nTo fall in love according to a plan.\nMyself have a shrewd notion where we might\nEnlist a cunning craftsman of this nature,\nAnd Mr. Microcosmus he is hight.\nFaust.\nWhat am I then, if still I strive in vain\nTo reach the crown of manhood's perfect stature,\nThe goal for which with all my life of life I strain?\nMephistopheles.\nThou art, do what thou wilt, just what thou art.\nHeap wigs on wigs by millions on thy head,\nAnd upon yard-high buskins tread,\nStill thou remainest simply what thou art.\nFaust.\nI feel it well, in vain have I uphoarded\nAll treasures that the mind of man afforded,\nAnd when I sit me down, I feel no more\nA well of life within me than before;\nNot ev'n one hairbreadth greater is my height,\nNot one inch nearer to the infinite.\nMephistopheles.\nMy worthy friend, these things you view,\nJust as they appear to you;\nSome wiser method we must shape us,\nEre the joys of life escape us.\nWhy, what the devil! hands and feet,\nBrain and brawn and blood are thine;\nAnd what I drink, and what I eat,\nWhose can it be, if 'tis not mine?\nIf I can number twice three horses,\nAre not their muscles mine? and when I'm mounted,\nI feel myself a man, and wheel my courses,\nJust as if four-and-twenty legs I counted.\nQuick then! have done with reverie,\nAnd dash into the world with me!\nI tell thee plain, a speculating fellow\nIs like an ox on heath all brown and yellow,\nLed in a circle by an evil spirit,\nWith roods of lush green pasture smiling near it.\nFaust.\nBut how shall we commence?\nMephistopheles.\nWe start this minute:\nWhy, what a place of torture is here,\nAnd what a life you live within it!\nYourself and your pack of younkers dear,\nKilling outright with ennui!\nLeave that to honest neighbor Paunch!\nThrashing of straw is not for thee:\nBesides, into the best of all your knowledge,\nYou know 'tis not permitted you to launch\nWith chicken-hearted boys at College.\nEv'n now, methinks, I hear one on the stair.\nFaust.\nSend him away: I cannot bear--\nMephistopheles.\nPoor boy! he's waited long, nor must depart\nWithout some friendly word for head and heart;\nCome, let me slip into your gown; the mask\nWill suit me well; as for the teaching task,\n[_He puts on_ /Faust's/ _scholastic robes._]\nLeave that to me! I only ask\nA quarter of an hour; and you make speed\nAnd have all ready for our journey's need. [_Exit._\nMephistopheles. [_solus_]\nContinue thus to hold at nought\nMan's highest power, his power of thought;\nThus let the Father of all lies\nWith shows of magic blind thine eyes,\nAnd thou art mine, a certain prize.\nTo him hath Fate a spirit given,\nWith reinless impulse ever forwards driven,\nWhose hasty striving overskips\nThe joys that flow for mortal lips;\nHim drag I on through life's wild chase,\nThrough flat unmeaning emptiness;\nHe shall cling and cleave to me,\nLike a sprawling child in agony,\nAnd food and drink, illusive hovering nigh,\nShall shun his parch\u00e8d lips, and cheat his longing eye;\nHe shall pine and pant and strain\nFor the thing he may not gain,\nAnd, though he ne'er had sold him to do evil,\nHe would have damned himself without help from the devil.\nScene VII.",

            "text": "_Enter a_ /Student/.\nStudent.\nI am but fresh arrived to-day,\nAnd come my best respects to pay,\nTo one whose name, from boor to Kaiser,\nNone, without veneration, mention.\nMephistopheles.\nI feel obliged by your attention!\nYou see a man than other men no wiser:\nHave you made inquiry elsewhere?\nStudent.\nBeseech you, sir, be my adviser!\nI come with money to spend and spare,\nWith fresh young blood, and a merry heart,\nOn my college career to start:\nMy mother sent me, not without a tear,\nTo get some needful schooling here.\nMephistopheles.\nA better place you could not find.\nStudent.\nTo speak the truth, 'tis not much to my mind.\nWithin these narrow cloister walls,\nThese antiquated Gothic halls,\nI feel myself but ill at ease;\nNo spot of green I see, no trees,\nAnd 'mid your formal rows of benches,\nI almost seem to lose my senses.\nMephistopheles.\nThat all depends on custom. Don't you see\nHow a young babe at first is slow\nTo know its mother's breast; but soon\nWith joy it strains the milky boon;\nSo you anon will suck nutrition\nFrom Wisdom's breasts with blest fruition.\nStudent.\nI yearn to do so even now;\nBut, in the first place, tell me how?\nMephistopheles.\nMy help is yours, or great or small;\nBut choose your Faculty, first of all.\nStudent.\nI aim at culture, learning, all\nThat men call science on the ball\nOf earth, or in the starry tent\nOf heaven; all Nature high and low,\nBroad and deep, I seek to know.\nMephistopheles.\nThere you are on the proper scent;\nOnly beware of too much distraction.\nStudent.\nWith soul and body I'm girt for action,\nAnd yet I cannot choose but praise\nA little freedom and merriment,\nOn pleasant summer holidays.\nMephistopheles.\nRedeem the time, for fast it fleets away,\nBut order rules the hour it cannot stay.\nTherefore 'tis plain that you must pass\nFirst of all through the logic class.\nThere will your mind be postured rightly,\nLaced up in Spanish buskins tightly,\nThat with caution and care, as wisdom ought,\nIt may creep along the path of thought,\nAnd not with fitful flickering glow\nWill o' the wisp it to and fro.\nThere, too, if you hear the gentleman through\nThe term, to every lecture true,\nYou'll learn that a stroke of human thinking,\nWhich you had practised once as free\nAnd natural as eating and drinking,\nCannot be made without one! two! three!\nTrue, it should seem that the tissue of thought\nIs like a web by cunning master wrought,\nWhere one stroke moves a thousand threads,\nThe shuttle shoots backwards and forwards between,\nThe slender threads flow together unseen,\nAnd one with the others thousand-fold weds:\nThen steps the philosopher forth to show\nHow of necessity it must be so:\nIf the first be so, the second is so,\nAnd therefore the third and the fourth is so;\nAnd unless the first and the second before be,\nThe third and the fourth can never more be.\nSo schoolmen teach and scholars believe,\nBut none of them yet ever learned to weave.\nHe who strives to know a thing well\nMust first the spirit within expel,\nThen can he count the parts in his hand,\nOnly without the spiritual band.\n_Encheiresis natur\u00e6_, 'tis clept in Chemistry,\nThus laughing at herself, albeit she knows not why.\nStudent.\nI must confess I can't quite comprehend you.\nMephistopheles.\nIn this respect time by and by will mend you,\nWhen you have learned the crude mixed masses\nTo decompose, and rank them in their classes.\nStudent.\nI feel as stupid to all he has said,\nAs a mill-wheel were whirling round in my head.\nMephistopheles.\nAfter logic, first of all,\nTo the study of metaphysics fall!\nThere strive to know what ne'er was made\nTo go into a human head;\nFor what is within and without its command\nA high-sounding word is always at hand.\nBut chiefly, for the first half year,\nLet order in all your studies appear;\nFive lectures a-day, that no time be lost,\nAnd with the clock be at your post!\nCome not, as some, without preparation,\nBut con his paragraphs o'er and o'er,\nTo be able to say, when you hear his oration,\nThat he gives you his book, and nothing more;\nYet not the less take down his words in writing,\nAs if the Holy Spirit were inditing!\nStudent.\nI shall not quickly give you cause\nTo repeat so weighty a clause;\nFor what with black on white is written,\nWe carry it home, a sure possession.\nMephistopheles.\nBut, as I said, you must choose a profession.\nStudent.\nWith Law, I must confess, I never was much smitten.\nMephistopheles.\nI should be loath to force your inclination,\nMyself have some small skill in legislation;\nFor human laws and rights from sire to son,\nLike an hereditary ill, flow on;\nFrom generation dragged to generation,\nAnd creeping slow from place to place.\nReason is changed to nonsense, good to evil,\nArt thou a grandson, woe betide thy case!\nOf Law they prate, most falsely clept the Civil,\nBut for that right, which from our birth we carry,\n'Tis not a word found in their Dictionary.\nStudent.\nYour words have much increased my detestation.\nO happy he, to whom such guide points out the way!\nAnd now, I almost feel an inclination\nTo give Theology the sway.\nMephistopheles.\nI have no wish to lead you astray.\nAs to this science, 'tis so hard to eschew\nThe false way, and to hit upon the true,\nAnd so much hidden poison lurks within,\nThat's scarce distinguished from the medicine.\nMethinks that here 'twere safest done\nThat you should listen but to one,\nAnd _jurare in verba magistri_\nIs the best maxim to assist thee.\nUpon the whole, I counsel thee\nTo stick to words as much as may be,\nFor such will still the surest way be\nInto the temple of certainty.\nStudent.\nYet in a word some sense must surely lurk.\nMephistopheles.\nYes, but one must not go too curiously to work;\nFor, just when our ideas fail us,\nA well-coined word may best avail us.\nWords are best weapons in disputing,\nIn system-building and uprooting,\nTo words most men will swear, though mean they ne'er so little,\nFrom words one cannot filch a single tittle.\nStudent.\nPardon me, if I trespass on your time,\nThough to make wisdom speak seems scarce a crime;\nOn medicine, too, I am concerned\nTo hear some pregnant word from one so learned.\nThree years, God knows, is a short time,\nAnd we have far to go, and high to climb;\nA wise man's fingers pointing to the goal\nWill save full many a groan to many a laboring soul.\nMephistopheles. [_aside_]\nI'm weary of this dry pedantic strain,\n'Tis time to play the genuine devil again.\n[_Aloud._] The spirit of Medicine 'tis not hard to seize:\nThe world, both great and small, you seek to know,\nThat in the end you may let all things go\nAs God shall please.\nIn vain you range around with scientific eyes,\nEach one at length learns only what he can;\nBut he who knows the passing hour to prize,\nThat is the proper man.\nA goodly shape and mien you vaunt,\nAnd confidence, I guess, is not your want,\nTrust but yourself, and, without more ado,\nAll other men will straightway trust you too.\nBut chiefly be intent to get a hold\nO' the women's minds: their endless Oh! and Ah!\nSo thousandfold,\nIn all its change, obeys a single law,\nAnd, if with half a modest air you come,\nYou have them all beneath your thumb.\nA title first must purchase their reliance,\nThat you have skill surpassing vulgar science;\nThus have you hold at once of all the seven ends,\nRound which another year of labor spends.\nStudy to press the pulse right tenderly,\nAnd, with a sly and fiery eye,\nTo hold her freely round the slender waist,\nThat you may see how tightly she is laced.\nStudent.\nThis seems to promise better; here we see\nWhere to apply and how to use the knife.\nMephistopheles.\nGray, my good friend, is every theory,\nBut green the golden tree of life.\nStudent.\nI vow I feel as in a dream; my brain\nContains much more than it can comprehend;\nSome other day may I come back again,\nTo hear your wisdom to the end?\nMephistopheles.\nWhat I can teach all men are free to know.\nStudent.\nOne little favor grant me ere I go;\nIt were my boast to take home on this page\n[_Presenting a leaf from his album._]\nSome sapient maxim from a man so sage.\nMephistopheles.\nRight willingly.\n[_He writes, and gives back the book._\nStudent. [_reads_]\n_Eritis sicut Deus scientes bonum et malum._\n[_He closes the book reverently, and takes his leave._\nMephistopheles.\nFollow the ancient saw, and my cousin, the famous old Serpent,\nRight soon shalt thou have cause, at thy godlike knowledge to\ntremble!\n_Enter_ /Faust/.",

Roof and walls are covered\nover with a strange assortment of furniture, and implements used by\nwitches._\n_Enter_ /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles./\nFaust.\nI cannot brook this brainless bedlam stuff!\nAnd must it be that I shall cast my slough\nIn this hotbed of all unreasoned doing?\nShall an old beldam give me what I lack?\nAnd can her pots and pans, with all their brewing,\nShake off full thirty summers from my back?\nWoe's me, if thou canst boast no better scheme!\nMy brightest hopes are vanished as a dream.\nHas Nature then, and has some noble Spirit,\nNo balsam for the body to repair it?\nMephistopheles.\nMy friend, with your great sense I cannot but be smitten!\nNature, too, boasts a plan to renovate your age;\nBut in a wondrous volume it is written,\nAnd wondrous is the chapter and the page.\nFaust.\nBut I must know it.\nMephistopheles.\nGood! the poorest man may try it,\nWithout or witch, or quack, or gold to buy it;\nAnd yet it works a certain cure.\nGo take thee with the peasant to the moor,\nAnd straight begin to hew and hack;\nConfine thee there, with patient mood,\nWithin the narrow beaten track,\nAnd nourish thee with simplest food;\nLive with the brute a brute, and count it not too low\nTo dung the corn-fields thine own hands shall mow;\nThan this I know on earth no med'cine stronger,\nTo make, by fourscore years, both soul and body younger!\nFaust.\nI was not trained to this--was never made\nTo labor with the pick-axe and the spade;\nSuch narrow round of life I may not brook.\nMephistopheles.\nThen you must look into another book,\nAnd be content to take the witch for cook.\nFaust.\nBut why this self-same ugly Jezebel?\nCould you not brew the drink yourself as well?\nMephistopheles.\nA precious pastime that indeed! meanwhile\nI had built bridges many a German mile.\nNot art, and science strict, are here enough,\nBut patience too, and perseverance tough.\nA thoughtful soul toils on through many a silent year.\nTime only makes the busy ferment clear,\nBesides that the ingredients all\nAre passing strange and mystical!\n'Tis true the devil taught them how to do it,\nBut not the devil with his own hands can brew it.\n[_Looking at the_ /Cat-Apes/.] Lo! what a tiny gay parade!\nHere's the man, and there's the maid!\n[_Addressing them._] It seems that your good mother has gone out?\nThe Cat-Apes.\nUp the chimney,\nWent she out,\nTo a drinking bout!\nMephistopheles.\nIs it her wont to gossip long without?\nThe Animals.\nAs long as we sit here and warm our feet.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nWhat think you of the brutes? are they not neat?\nFaust.\nI never saw such tasteless would-be-drolls!\nMephistopheles.\nPooh! pooh!--I know no greater delectation\nOn earth, than such a merry conversation.\n[_To the brutes._] Now let us hear, you pretty dolls,\nWhat are you stirring there in the pot?\nThe Brutes.\nSoup for beggars, hissing and hot,\nThin and watery, that's the stew.\nMephistopheles.\nYour customers will not be few.\nThe Father Cat-Ape. [_comes up and fawns upon_ /Mephistopheles/]\nCome rattle the dice,\nMake me rich in a trice,\nCome, come, let me gain!\nMy case is so bad,\nIt scarce could be worse:\nWere I right in my purse,\nI'd be right in my brain!\nMephistopheles.\nHow happy would the apish creature be,\nTo buy a ticket in the lottery!\n[_Meanwhile the young_ /Cat-Apes/ _have been playing with a large\nglobe, and roll it forwards._\nThe Father Cat-Ape.\nSuch is the world,\nSo doth it go,\nUp and down,\nTo and fro!\nLike glass it tinkles,\nLike glass it twinkles,\nBreaks in a minute,\nHas nothing within it;\nHere it sparkles,\nThere it darkles,\nI am alive!\nMy dear son, I say,\nKeep out of the way!\nIf you don't strive,\nYou will die, you will die!\nIt is but of clay,\nAnd in pieces will fly!\nMephistopheles.\nWhat make you with the sieve?\nThe Father Cat-Ape. [_bringing down the sieve_]\nWhen comes a thief,\nOn the instant we know him.\n[_He runs off to the_ /Mother Cat-Ape/, _and lets her look through\nthe sieve._]\nLook through the sieve!\nSee'st thou the thief,\nAnd fearest to show him?\nMephistopheles. [_coming near the fire_]\nAnd this pot?\nFather Cat-Ape and his Wife.\nThe silly sot!\nHe knows not the pot!\nAnd he knows not\nThe kettle, the sot!\nMephistopheles.\nYou ill-bred urchin, you!\nThe Father Cat-Ape.\nCome, sit thee down,\nWe'll give thee a crown,\nAnd a sceptre too!\n[_He obliges_ /Mephistopheles/ _to sit down, and gives him a long\nbrush for a sceptre._\nFaust. [_Who, while_ /Mephistopheles/ _was engaged with the\nanimals,_ /Faust/ _had been standing before a mirror,\nalternately approaching it and retiring from it._]\nWhat see I here? what heavenly image bright,\nWithin this magic mirror, chains my sight?\nO Love, the swiftest of thy pinions lend me,\nThat where she is in rapture I may bend me!\nAlas! when I would move one step more near,\nTo breathe her balmy atmosphere,\nShe seems to melt and disappear,\nAnd cheats my longing eye.\nOh she is fair beyond all type of human!\nIs't possible; can this be simple woman?\nThere lies she, on that downy couch reposing,\nWithin herself the heaven of heavens enclosing!\nCan it then be that earth a thing so fair contains?\nMephistopheles.\nOf course: for when a god has vexed his brains\nFor six long days, and, when his work is done,\nSays bravo to himself, is it a wonder\nHe should make one fair thing without a blunder?\nFor this time give thine eyes their pleasure;\nI know how to procure you such an one,\nWhence thou mayst drink delight in brimming measure,\nAnd blest the man, for whom Fate shall decide,\nTo lead home such a treasure as his bride!\n[/Faust/ _continues gazing on the mirror._ /Mephistopheles/\n_stretches himself on the arm-chair, and, playing with\nthe brush, goes on as follows:_]\nHere, from my throne, a monarch, I look down:\nMy sceptre this: I wait to get my crown.\nThe Animals. [_Who had in the interval been wheeling about with\nstrange antic gestures, bring a crown to_ /Mephistopheles/,\n_with loud shouts._]\nO be but so good,\nWith sweat and with blood,\nYour crown to glue,\nAs monarchs do!\n[_They use the crown rather roughly, in consequence of which\nit falls into two pieces, with which they jump about._]\nO sorrow and shame!\n'Tis broken, no doubt:\nBut we'll make a name,\nWhen our poem comes out!\nFaust. [_gazing on the mirror_]\nWoe's me! her beauty doth my wits confound.\nMephistopheles. [_pointing to the Brutes_]\nAnd even my good brain is whirling round and round.\nThe Brutes.\nAnd if we well speed,\nAs speed well we ought,\nWe are makers indeed,\nWe are moulders of thought.\nFaust. [_as above_]\nI burn, I burn! this rapturous glow\nConsumes me sheer!--come, let us go!\nMephistopheles. [_as above_]\nOne must, at least, confess that they\nAre honest poets in their way.\n[_The kettle, which had been neglected by the Mother_ /Cat-Ape/\n_begins to boil over: A great flame arises, and runs up the chimney.\nThe Witch comes through the flame, down the chimney, with a terrible\nnoise._\nThe Witch.\nOw! ow! ow! ow!\nThou damn\u00e8d brute! thou curs\u00e8d sow!\nTo leave the kettle and singe the frow!\nThou cursed imp, thou!\n[_Turning to_ /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.]\nWhat's this here now?\nWho are you? who are you?\nWhat's here ado?\nYe are scouts! ye are scouts!\nOut with the louts!\nA fiery arrow\nConsume your marrow!\n[_She plunges the ladle into the kettle, and spurts out flame on_\n/Faust, Mephistopheles/, _and the Brutes. These last whine._\nMephistopheles. [_Who, in the meantime, had turned round the\nbutt-end of the brush, now dashes in amongst the pots and glasses._]\nIn two! in two!\nThere lies the broth!\nThe glass and the kettle,\nShiver them both!\n'Tis a jest, thou must know,\nThou carrion crow!\n'Tis a tune to keep time,\nTo thy senseless rhyme.\n[_While the Witch, foaming with rage and fury, draws back._]\nWhat! know'st me not? thou scrag! thou Jezebel!\nThy lord and master? thou should'st know me well.\nWhat hinders me, in all my strength to come\nAnd crush you and your cat-imps 'neath my thumb?\nKnow'st not the scarlet-doublet, mole-eyed mother?\nBow'st not the knee before the famed cock's feather?\nUse your old eyes; behind a mask\nDid I conceal my honest face?\nAnd when I come here must I ask\nA special introduction to your Grace?\nThe Witch.\nO my liege lord! forgive the rough salute!\nI did not see the horse's foot:\nAnd where too have you left your pair of ravens?\nMephistopheles.\nFor this time you may thank the heavens\nThat you have made so cheap an escape;\n'Tis some time since I saw your face,\nAnd things since then have moved apace.\nThe march of modern cultivation,\nThat licks the whole world into shape,\nHas reached the Devil. In this wise generation\nThe Northern phantom is no longer seen,\nAnd horns and tail and claws have been.\nAnd for my hoof, with which I can't dispense,\nIn good society 'twould give great offence;\nTherefore, like many a smart sprig of nobility,\nI use false calves to trick out my gentility.\nThe Witch. [_dancing_]\nHeyday! it almost turns my brain\nTo see Squire Satan here again!\nMephistopheles.\nWoman, you must not call me by that name!\nThe Witch.\nAnd wherefore not? I see no cause for shame.\nMephistopheles.\nThat name has had its station long assigned\nWith Mother Bunch; and yet I cannot see\nMen are much better for the want of me.\nThe wicked one is gone, the wicked stay behind.\nCall me now Baron, less than that were rude--\nI am a cavalier like other cavaliers;\nMy line is noble, and my blood is good;\nHere is a coat of arms that all the world reveres.\n[_He makes an indecent gesture._\nThe Witch. [_laughing immoderately_]\nHa! ha! now I perceive Old Nick is here!\nYou are a rogue still, as you always were.\nMephistopheles. [_aside to_ /Faust/]\nMy friend, I give you here, your wit to whet,\nA little lesson in witch-etiquette.\nThe Witch.\nNow say, good sirs, what would you have with me?\nMephistopheles.\nA glass of your restoring liquor,\nThat makes an old man's blood run quicker:\nAnd bring the best out from your bins;\nWith years the juice in virtue wins.\nThe Witch.\nMost willingly. Here I have got a phial\nOf which myself at times make trial:\n'Tis now a pleasant mellow potion;\nYou shall not meet with a denial.\n[_Softly._] Yet if this worthy man drinks it without precaution,\nHis life can't stand an hour against its strong infection.\nMephistopheles.\nLeave that to me; he's under my protection,\nRipe for the draught; no harm will come to him.\n[_The_ /Witch/, _with strange gestures, draws a circle and places\nmany curious things within it; meanwhile the glasses begin to tinkle,\nand the kettle to sound and make music. She brings a large book, puts\nthe_ /Cat-Apes/ _into the circle, and makes them serve as a desk to\nlay the book on, and hold the torches. She motions to_ /Faust/ _to\ncome near._\nFaust. [_to_ /Mephistopheles/]\nNow say, what would she with this flummery?\nThese antic gestures, this wild bedlam-stuff,\nThis most insipid of all mummery,\nI know it well, I hate it well enough.\nMephistopheles.\nPshaw, nonsense! come, give up your sermonizing,\nAnd learn to understand what a good joke is!\nLike other quacks, she plays her hocus-pocus;\nIt gives the juice a virtue most surprising!\n[_He obliges_ /Faust/ _to enter the circle._\nThe Witch. [_declaiming from the book with great emphasis_]\nNow be exact!\nOf one make ten,\nThen two subtract,\nAnd add three then,\nThis makes thee rich.\nFour shalt thou bate,\nOf five and six,\nSo says the Witch,\nMake seven and eight,\nAnd all is done.\nAnd nine is one,\nAnd ten is none;\nHere take and spell, if you are able,\nThe Witches' multiplication table.\nFaust.\nThis is a jargon worse than Babel;\nSay, is she fevered? is she mad?\nMephistopheles.\nO never fear! the rest is quite as bad;\nI know the book, and oft have vexed my brains\nWith bootless labor on its rhymes and rules;\nA downright contradiction still remains,\nMysterious alike for wise men and for fools.\nMy friend, the art is old and new;\nAncient and modern schools agree\nWith three and one, and one and three\nPlain to perplex, and false inweave with true.\nSo they expound, discourse, dispute, debate;\nWhat man of sense would plague him with their prate?\nMen pin their faith to words, in sounds high sapience weening,\nThough words were surely made to have a meaning.\nThe Witch. [_Goes on reading from the book_]\nThe soul to know\nBeneath the show,\nAnd view it without blinking;\nThe simple mind\nThe craft will find,\nWithout the toil of thinking.\nFaust.\nWhat flood of nonsense now she's pouring o'er us?\nShe'll split my skull with her insensate chatter.\nI feel as if I heard the ceaseless clatter\nOf thirty thousand idiots in a chorus.\nMephistopheles.\nEnough, kind Sibyl; thanks for thy good will!\nNow bring your jug here, and the goblet fill\nWith this prime juice, till it be brimming o'er.\nMy friend here is a man of high degrees,\nAnd will digest the draught with ease.\nHe has swilled many a goodly glass before.\n[_The_ /Witch/, _with many ceremonies, pours the beverage into\na cup. While_ /Faust/ _brings it to his mouth a light flame arises._\nMephistopheles.\nCome, quaff it boldly, without thinking!\nThe draught will make thy heart to burn with love.\nArt with the Devil hand and glove,\nAnd from a fire-spurt would'st be shrinking?\n[_The_ /Witch/ _looses the circle._ /Faust/ _steps out._\nMephistopheles.\nCome quickly out; you must not rest.\nThe Witch.\nI hope the swig will wonders work on thee!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd you, if you have aught to beg of me,\nUpon Walpurgis' night make your request.\nThe Witch.\nHere is a song! at times sung, you will find\nIt hath a wondrous working on your mind.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nCome, yield thee now to my desire;\nBe meek for once, and own the bridle.\nYou must keep quiet, and let yourself perspire,\nThat through your inmost frame the potent juice may pierce.\nWhen we have time to spare, I will rehearse\nSome lessons on the art of being nobly idle;\nAnd soon thy heart with ecstasy shall know,\nHow Cupid 'gins to stir, and boundeth to and fro.\nFaust. [_Turning again towards the mirror_]\nIndulge me with one glance!--one moment spare!\nIt was a virgin-form surpassing fair!\nMephistopheles.\nNo! No! with my good aid thou soon shalt see\nThe paragon of women bodily.\n[_Aside._] Anon, if this good potion does its duty,\nHe'll see in every wench the Trojan beauty.\nScene IV.",

[_looking round_]\nBe greeted, thou sweet twilight-shine!\nThrough this chaste sanctuary shed!\nOh seize my heart, sweet pains of love divine,\nThat on the languid dew of hope are fed!\nWhat sacred stillness holds the air!\nWhat order, what contentment rare!\n[_He throws himself on the old leathern arm-chair beside the bed._]\nReceive thou me! thou, who, in ages gone,\nIn joy and grief hast welcomed sire and son.\nHow often round this old paternal throne,\nA clambering host of playful children hung!\nBelike that here my loved one too hath clung\nTo her hoar grandsire's neck, with childish joy\nThankful received the yearly Christmas toy,\nAnd with the full red cheeks of childhood pressed\nUpon his withered hand a pious kiss.\nI feel, sweet maid, mine inmost soul possessed\nBy thy calm spirit of order and of bliss,\nThat motherly doth teach thee day by day:\nThat bids thee deck the table clean and neat,\nAnd crisps the very sand strewn at thy feet.\nSweet hand! sweet, lovely hand! where thou dost sway,\nThe meanest hut is decked in heaven's array.\nAnd here! [_He lifts up the bed-curtain._]\nO Heaven, what strange o'ermastering might\nThrills every sense with fine delight!\nHere might I gaze unwearied day and night.\nNature! in airy dreams here didst thou build\nThe mortal hull of the angelic child;\nHere she reposed! her tender bosom teeming\nWith warmest life, in buoyant fulness streaming,\nAnd here, with pulse of gently gracious power,\nThe heaven-born bud was nursed into a flower!\nAnd thou! what brought thee here? why now backshrinks\nThy courage from the prize it sought before?\nWhat wouldst thou have? Thy heart within thee sinks;\nPoor wretched Faust! thou know'st thyself no more.\nDo I then breathe a magic atmosphere?\nI sought immediate enjoyment here,\nAnd into viewless dreams my passion flows!\nAre we the sport of every breath that blows?\nIf now she came, and found me gazing here,\nHow for this boldfaced presence must I pay!\nThe mighty man, how small would he appear,\nAnd at her feet, a suppliant, sink away!\nMephistopheles. [_coming back_]\nQuick! quick! I see her--she'll be here anon.\nFaust.\nYes, let's be gone! for once and all be gone!\nMephistopheles.\nHere is a casket, of a goodly weight;\nIts former lord, I ween, bewails its fate.\nCome, put it in the press. I swear\nShe'll lose her senses when she sees it there.\nThe trinkets that I stowed within it\nWere bait meant for a nobler prey:\nBut child is child, and play is play!\nFaust.\nI know not--shall I?\nMephistopheles.\nCan you doubt a minute?\nWould you then keep the dainty pelf,\nLike an old miser, to yourself?\nIf so, I would advise you, sir,\nTo spare your squire the bitter toil,\nAnd with some choicer sport the hour beguile\nThan looking lustfully at her.\nI scratch my head and rub my hands that you--\n[_He puts the casket into the cupboard, and locks the door again._]\nCome, let's away!--\nWith this sweet piece of womanhood may do,\nAs will may sway;\nAnd you stand there,\nAnd gape and stare,\nAs if you looked into a lecture-room,\nAnd there with awe\nThe twin grey spectres bodily saw,\nPhysics and Metaphysics! Come!\n[_Exeunt._\n_Enter_ /Margaret/, _with a lamp._\nMargaret.\nIt is so sultry here, so hot! [_She opens the window._]\nAnd yet so warm without 'tis not.\nI feel--I know not how--oppressed;\nWould to God that my mother came!\nA shivering cold runs o'er my frame--\nI'm but a silly timid girl at best!\n[_While taking off her clothes, she sings._]\nThere was a king in Thule,\nTrue-hearted to his grave:\nTo him his dying lady\nA golden goblet gave.\nHe prized it more than rubies;\nAt every drinking-bout\nHis eyes they swam in glory,\nWhen he would drain it out.\nOn his death-bed he counted\nHis cities one by one;\nUnto his heirs he left them;\nThe bowl he gave to none.\nHe sat amid his barons,\nAnd feasted merrily,\nWithin his father's castle,\nThat beetles o'er the sea.\nThere stood the old carouser,\nAnd drank his life's last glow;\nThen flung the goblet over\nInto the sea below.\nHe saw it fall, and gurgling\nSink deep into the sea;\nHis eyes they sank in darkness;\nNo bumper more drank he.\n[_She opens the cupboard to put in her clothes, and sees the\ncasket._]\nHow came the pretty casket here? no doubt\nI locked the press when I went out.\n'Tis really strange!--Belike that it was sent\nA pledge for money that my mother lent.\nHere hangs the key; sure there can be no sin\nIn only looking what may be within.\nWhat have we here? good heavens! see!\nWhat a display of finery!\nHere is a dress in which a queen\nMight on a gala-day be seen.\nI wonder how the necklace would suit me!\nWho may the lord of all this splendor be?\n[_She puts on the necklace, and looks at herself in the glass._]\nWere but the ear-rings mine to wear!\nIt gives one such a different air.\nWhat boots the beauty of the poor?\n'Tis very beautiful to be sure,\nBut without riches little weighs;\nThey praise you, but half pity while they praise.\nGold is the pole,\nTo which all point: the whole\nBig world hangs on gold.

how could you kiss it so?\nIt is so coarse, so rough! for I must go\nThrough all the work above stairs and below,\nMother will have it so.\n[_They pass on._\nMartha.\nAnd you, sir, will it still\nBe your delight from place to place to roam?\nMephistopheles.\nIn this our duty guides us, not our will.\nWith what sad hearts from many a place we go,\nWhere we had almost learned to be at home!\nMartha.\nWhen one is young it seems a harmless gambol,\nThus round and round through the wide world to ramble:\nBut soon the evil day comes on,\nAnd as a stiff old bachelor to die\nHas never yet done good to any one.\nMephistopheles.\nI see ahead, and fear such wretched fate.\nMartha.\nThen, sir, take warning ere it be too late!\n[_They pass on._\nMargaret.\nYes, out of sight, and out of mind!\nYou see me now, and are so kind:\nBut you have friends at home of station high,\nWith far more wit and far more sense than I.\nFaust.\nTheir sense, dear girl, is often nothing more\nThan vain conceit of vain short-sighted lore.\nMargaret.\nHow mean you that?\nFaust.\nOh that the innocent heart\nAnd sweet simplicity, unspoiled by art,\nSo seldom knows its own rare quality!\nThat fair humility, the comeliest grace\nWhich bounteous Nature sheds on blooming face--\nMargaret.\nDo thou bestow a moment's thought on me,\nI shall have time enough to think of thee.\nFaust.\nYou are then much alone?\nMargaret.\nOur household is but small, I own,\nAnd yet must be attended to.\nWe keep no maid; I have the whole to do,\nMust wash and brush, and sew and knit,\nAnd cook, and early run and late;\nAnd then my mother is, in every whit,\nSo accurate!\nNot that she needs to pinch her household; we\nMight do much more than many others do:\nMy father left a goodly sum, quite free\nFrom debt, with a neat house and garden too,\nClose by the town, just as you pass the gate;\nBut we have lived retired enough of late.\nMy brother is a soldier: he\nIs at the wars: my little sister's dead:\nPoor thing! it caused me many an hour of pain\nTo see it pine, and droop its little head,\nBut gladly would I suffer all again,\nSo much I loved the child!\nFaust.\nAn angel, if like thee!\nMargaret.\nI nursed it, and it loved me heartily.\nMy father died before it saw the light,\nMy mother was despaired of quite,\nSo miserably weak she lay.\nYet she recovered slowly, day by day;\nAnd as she had not strength herself\nTo suckle the poor helpless elf,\nShe gave't in charge to me, and I\nWith milk and water nursed it carefully.\nThus in my arm, and on my lap, it grew,\nAnd smiled and crowed, and flung its legs about,\nAnd called me mother too.\nFaust.\nTo thy pure heart the purest joy, no doubt.\nMargaret.\nAy! but full many an hour\nHeavy with sorrow, and with labor sour.\nThe infant's cradle stood beside\nMy bed, and when it stirred or cried,\nI must awake;\nSometimes to give it drink, sometimes to take\nIt with me to my bed, and fondle it:\nAnd when all this its fretting might not stay,\nI rose, and danced about, and dandled it;\nAnd after that I must away\nTo wash the clothes by break of day.\nI make the markets too, and keep house for my mother,\nOne weary day just like another;\nThus drudging on, the day might lack delights,\nBut food went lightly down, and sleep was sweet o' nights.\n[_They pass on._\nMartha.\nA woman's case is not much to be vaunted;\nA hardened bachelor is hard to mend.\nMephistopheles.\nA few apostles such as you were wanted,\nFrom evil ways their vagrant steps to bend.\nMartha.\nSpeak plainly, sir, have you found nothing yet?\nAre you quite disentangled from the net?\nMephistopheles.\nA house and hearth, we have been often told,\nWith a good wife, is worth its weight in gold.\nMartha.\nI mean, sir, have you never felt the want?\nMephistopheles.\nA good reception I have always found.\nMartha.\nI mean to say, did your heart never pant?\nMephistopheles.\nFor ladies my respect is too profound\nTo jest on such a serious theme as this.\nMartha.\nMy meaning still you strangely miss!\nMephistopheles.\nAlas, that I should be so blind!\nOne thing I plainly see, that you are very kind!\n[_They pass on._\nFaust.\nYou knew me, then, you little angel! straight,\nWhen you beheld me at the garden-gate?\nMargaret.\nMarked you it not?--You saw my downward look.\nFaust.\nAnd you forgive the liberty I took,\nWhen from the minster you came out that day,\nAnd I, with forward boldness more than meet,\nThen ventured to address you on the street?\nMargaret.\nI was surprised, I knew not what to say;\nNo one could speak an evil word of me.\nDid he, perchance, in my comportment see\nAught careless or improper on that day,\nThat he should take me for a worthless girl,\nWhom round his little finger he might twirl?\nNot yet the favorable thoughts I knew,\nThat even then were rising _here_ for you;\nOne thing I know, myself I sharply chid,\nThat I could treat you then no harshlier than I did.\nFaust.\nSweet love!\nMargaret.\nLet go!\n[_She plucks a star-flower, and pulls the petals off one after\nanother._\nFaust.\nWhat's that? a nosegay? let me see!\nMargaret.\n'Tis but a game.\nFaust.\nHow so?\nMargaret.\nGo! you would laugh at me.\n[_She continues pulling the petals, and murmuring to herself._\nFaust.\nWhat are you murmuring now, so sweetly low?\nMargaret. [_half loud_]\nHe loves me, yes!--he loves me, no!\nFaust.\nThou sweet angelic face!\nMargaret. [_murmuring as before_]\nHe loves me, yes!--he loves me, no!\n[_Pulling out the last petal with manifest delight._]\nHe loves me, yes!\nFaust.\nYes, child! the fair flower-star hath answered /Yes/!\nIn this the judgment of the gods approves thee;\nHe loves thee! know'st thou what it means?--He loves thee!\n[_He seizes her by both hands._\nMargaret.\nI scarce can speak for joy!\nFaust.\nFear thee not, love! But let this look proclaim,\nThis pressure of my hand declare\nWhat words can never name:\nTo yield us to an ecstacy of joy,\nAnd feel this tranceful bliss must be\nEternal! yes! its end would be despair!\nIt hath no end! no end for thee and me!\n[/Margaret/ _presses his hands, makes herself free, and runs away.\nHe stands still for a moment thoughtfully, then follows her._",

I do not grudge you quiet,\nYou need my aid, and you cannot deny it.\nThere is not much to lose, I trow,\nWith one so harsh, and gruff, and mad as thou.\nToil! moil! from morn to ev'n, so on it goes!\nAnd what one should, and what one should not do,\nOne cannot always read it on your nose.\nFaust.\nThis is the proper tone for you!\nAnnoy me first, and then my thanks are due.\nMephistopheles.\nPoor son of Earth! without my timed assistance,\nHow had you ever dragged on your existence?\nFrom freakish fancy's fevered effervescence,\nI have worked long ago your convalescence,\nAnd, but for me, you would have marched away,\nIn your best youth, from the blest light of day.\nWhat have you here, in caves and clefts, to do,\nLike an old owl, screeching to-whit, to-whoo?\nOr like a torpid toad, that sits alone\nSipping the oozing moss and dripping stone?\nA precious condition to be in!\nI see the Doctor sticks yet in your skin.\nFaust.\nCouldst thou but know what re-born vigor springs\nFrom this lone wandering in the wilderness,\nCouldst thou conceive what heavenly joy it brings,\nThen wert thou fiend enough to envy me my bliss.\nMephistopheles.\nA supermundane bliss!\nIn night and dew to lie upon the height,\nAnd clasp the heaven and earth in wild delight,\nTo swell up to the godhead's stature,\nAnd pierce with clear miraculous sight\nThe inmost pith of central Nature,\nTo carry in your breast with strange elation,\nThe ferment of the whole six days' creation,\nWith proud anticipation of--I know\nNot what--to glow in rapturous overflow,\nAnd melt into the universal mind,\nCasting the paltry son of earth behind;\nAnd then, the heaven-sprung intuition\n[_With a gesture._] To end--I shall not say in what--fruition.\nFaust.\nShame on thee!\nMephistopheles.\nYes! that's not quite to your mind.\nYou have a privilege to cry out shame,\nWhen things are mentioned by their proper name.\nBefore chaste ears one may not dare to spout\nWhat chastest hearts yet cannot do without.\nI do not envy you the pleasure\nOf palming lies upon yourself at leisure;\nBut long it cannot last, I warrant thee.\nYou are returned to your old whims, I see,\nAnd, at this rate, you soon will wear\nYour strength away, in madness and despair.\nOf this enough! thy love sits waiting thee,\nIn doubt and darkness, cabined and confined.\nBy day, by night, she has thee in her mind;\nI trow she loves thee in no common kind.\nThy raging passion 'gan to flow,\nLike a torrent in spring from melted snow;\nInto her heart thy tide gushed high,\nNow is thy shallow streamlet dry.\nInstead of standing here to overbrim\nWith fine ecstatic rapture to the trees,\nMethinks the mighty gentleman might please\nTo drop some words of fond regard, to ease\nThe sweet young chick who droops and pines for him.\nPoor thing, she is half dead of ennui,\nAnd at the window stands whole hours, to see\nThe clouds pass by the old town-wall along.\nWere I a little bird! so goes her song\nThe live-long day, and half the night to boot.\nSometimes she will be merry, mostly sad,\nNow, like a child, weeping her sorrows out,\nNow calm again to look at, never glad;\nAlways in love.\nFaust.\nThou snake! thou snake!\nMephistopheles. [_to himself_]\nSo be it! that my guile thy stubborn will may break!\nFaust.\nHence and begone, thou son of filth and fire!\nName not the lovely maid again!\nBring not that overmastering desire\nOnce more to tempt my poor bewildered brain!\nMephistopheles.\nWhat then? she deems that you are gone forever;\nAnd half and half methinks you are.\nFaust.\nNo! I am nigh, and were I ne'er so far,\nI could forget her, I could lose her never;\nI envy ev'n the body of the Lord,\nWhen on the sacred cake her lips she closes.\nMephistopheles.\nYes! to be honest, and confess my sins,\nI oft have envied thee the lovely twins\nThat have their fragrant pasture among roses.\nFaust.\nAvaunt, thou pimp!\nMephistopheles.\nRail you, and I will laugh;\nThe God who made the human stuff\nBoth male and female, if the book don't lie,\nHimself the noblest trade knew well enough,\nHow to carve out an opportunity.\nBut come, why peak and pine you here?\nI lead you to the chamber of your dear,\nNot to the gallows.\nFaust.\nAh! what were Heaven's supremest blessedness\nWithin her arms, upon her breast, to me!\nMust I not still be wrung with agony,\nThat I should plunge her into such distress?\nI, the poor fugitive! outlaw from my kind,\nWithout a friend, without a home,\nWith restless heart, and aimless mind,\nUnblest, unblessing, ever doomed to roam;\nWho, like a waterfall, from rock to rock came roaring,\nWith greedy rage into the caldron pouring;\nWhile she, a heedless infant, rears\nSidewards her hut upon the Alpine field,\nWith all her hopes, and all her fears,\nWithin this little world concealed.\nAnd I--the God-detested--not content\nTo seize the rocks, and in my headlong bent\nTo shatter them to dust, with ruthless tide\nHer little shielding on the mountain side\nBore down, and wrecked her life's sweet peace with mine.\nAnd such an offering, Hell, must it be thine?\nHelp, Devil, to cut short the hour of ill!\nWhat happen must, may happen when it will!\nMay her sad fate my crashing fall attend,\nAnd she with me be ruined in the end!\nMephistopheles.\nLo! how it boils again and blows\nLike furnace, wherefore no man knows.\nGo in, thou fool, and let her borrow\nFrom thee, sweet solace to her sorrow!\nWhen such a brainsick dreamer sees\nNo road, where he to walk may please,\nHe stands and stares like Balaam's ass,\nAs if a god did block the pass.\nA man's a man who does and dares!\nIn other points you're spiced not scantly with the devil;\nNothing more silly moves on earth's wide level,\nThan is a devil who despairs.\nScene IV.",

[_semi-chorus_]\nWe trail us on, like very snails,\nThe women fly with flaunting sails;\nFor, when we run Squire Satan's races,\nThey always win by a thousand paces.\nSemi-Chorus.\nNot quite so bad: the women need\nA thousand paces to help their speed;\nBut let them speed what most they can,\nWith one spring comes up the man.\nVoice. [_from above_]\nCome up! come up from the lake with me.\nVoices. [_from below_]\nRight gladly would we mount with thee;\nWe wash, and wash, and cease from washing never;\nOur skins are as white as white can be,\nBut we are as dry and barren as ever.\nBoth Choruses.\nThe wind is hushed, the stars take flight,\nThe sullen moon hath veiled her light,\nThe magic choir from whizzing wings,\nLong lines of sparkling glory flings.\nVoice. [_from below_]\nStop, stop!\nVoice. [_from above_]\nWho bawls so loud from the cleft?\nVoice. [_from below_]\nLet me go with you! let me not be left!\nThree hundred years I grope and grope\nRound the base and up the slope,\nBut still the summit cheats my hope.\nI fain would be a merry guest\nAt Satan's banquet with the rest.\nBoth Choruses.\nOn broomstick, and on lusty goat,\nOn pitchfork, and on stick, we float;\nAnd he, to-day who cannot soar,\nIs a lost man for evermore.\nHalf-Witch.

[_at a distance_]\nHere!\nMephistopheles.\nWhat! so far in the rear!\nWhy then 'tis time that I should use my right,\nAs master of the house to-night.\nMake way!

[_Who all at once appears very old_]\nThe people here seem ripe for Doom's day; I\nSuspect the world is now on its last legs;\nAnd, since mine own good cask is running dry,\nMen and their ways, I guess, are near the dregs!\nPeddler-Witch.\nGood sirs, I pray you pass not by,\nCast on my wares a friendly eye!\nOne cannot see such rich display\nOf curious trinkets every day.\nYet is there nothing in my store\n(Which far all other stores excels),\nThat hath not done some mischief sore\nTo earth, and all on earth that dwells;\nNo dagger by which blood hath not been shed,\nNo cup from which, through sound and healthy life,\nCorroding fiery juice hath not been spread,\nNo gaud but hath seduced some lovely wife,\nNo sword that hath not made a truce miscarry,\nOr stabbed behind the back its adversary.\nMephistopheles.\nGood lady cousin! you come rather late.\nYour wares, believe me, are quite out of date;\nDeal in the new and newest; that\nOur palate smacks; all else is flat.\nFaust.\nThis is a fair that beats the Leipzig hollow!\nMy head is so confused, I scarce can follow.\nMephistopheles.\nTo the top the stream is rushing,\nAnd we are pushed, when we think we are pushing.\nFaust.\nWho, then, is that?\nMephistopheles.\nLook at her well.\n'Tis Lilith.[*n13]\nFaust.\nWho?\nMephistopheles.\nAdam's first wife. Beware,\nArt thou a wise man, of her glossy hair!\n'Tis fair to look on, but its look is fell.\nThose locks with which she outshines all the train,\nWhen she hath bound a young man with that chain,\nShe'll hold him fast; he'll scarce come back again.\nFaust.\nThere sit an old and young one on the sward;\nThey seem to have been dancing somewhat hard.\nMephistopheles.\nO! once begun, they'll go on like the devil.\nCome, come! they rise again--let's join the revel.\n[/Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/ _join the dance; the former\nwith the Young Witch as his partner; the latter with the Old one._\nFaust. [_dancing with the young Witch_]\nA lovely dream once came to me,\nI saw in my sleep an apple-tree;\nTwo lovely apples on it did shine;\nI clomb the pole to make them mine.\nThe Young Witch.\nFor apples your sire in Paradise\nAnd primal dame had longing eyes:\nAnd, if your eyes are wise to see,\nYou'll find such apples on my tree.\nMephistopheles. [_dancing with the old Witch_]\nAn ugly dream once came to me,\nI dreamed I saw a cloven tree;\nIn the tree there sat an ugly owl;\nI called it fair, though it was foul.\nThe Old Witch.\nMy best salute this night shall be,\nThou knight of the cloven foot, to thee;\nA cloven tree with an ugly owl,\nAnd I for thee, or fair, or foul.\nProctophantasmist.[*n14] [_to the dancers_]\nListen to order, you presumptuous brood!\nHave we not proved beyond disputing,\nThat ghosts on terra firma have no footing?\nAnd yet you dance like any flesh and blood?\nThe Young Witch. [_dancing_]\nWhat wants he here, that rude-like fellow there?\nFaust. [_dancing_]\nO, he is everywhere!\nWhat others dance 'tis his to prize;\nEach step he cannot criticise\nHad as well not been made. But in the dance\nIt grieves him most when we advance.\nIf we would wheel still round and round in a ring,\nAs he is fond to do in his old mill,\nHe would not take it half so ill;\nEspecially if you take care to bring\nYour praiseful offering to his master skill.\nProctophantasmist.\nWhat! still there, phantoms? this is past endurance!\nIn this enlightened age you have the assurance\nTo show your face and play your tricks undaunted;\nWe are so wise, and yet a man's own house is haunted.\nHow long have I not swept the cobwebs of delusion,\nAnd still the world remains in the same wild confusion!\nThe Young Witch.\nBe quiet then, and seek some other place!\nProctophantasmist.\nI tell you, Spirits, in your face,\nThis intellectual thrall I cannot bear it;\nI love to have a free unshackled spirit. [_The dance goes on._]\nTo-day I see that all my strength is spent in vain;\nI've had a tour, at least, to compensate my evils,\nAnd hope, before I come to Blocksberg back again,\nTo crush, with one good stroke, the poets and the devils.\nMephistopheles.\nHe will now go, and, bare of breeches,\nSit in a pool with solemn patience;\nAnd, when his buttocks are well sucked by leeches,\nBe cured of ghosts and ghostly inspirations.\n[_To_ /Faust/, _who has just left the dance._]\nWhy do you let the lovely damsel go,\nThat in the dance with sweet song pleased you so?\nFaust.\nAlas! while she so passing sweet was singing,\nI saw a red mouse from her mouth outspringing.\nMephistopheles.\nPooh! on the Brocken that's a thing of course;\nLet not such trifles mar your sweet discourse.\nGo, join the crew, and dance away;\nEnough, the red mouse was not gray.\nFaust.\nThen saw I--\nMephistopheles.\nWhat?\nFaust.\nMephisto, see'st thou there\nA pale yet lovely girl, in lonely distance fare?\nFrom place to place she moveth slow;\nWith shackled feet she seems to go;\nI must confess, she has a cast\nOf Margaret, when I saw her last.\nMephistopheles.\nLet that alone! it brings thee certain harm;\nIt is bewitched, a bloodless, breathless form,\nFor men to look upon it is not good.\nIts fix\u00e8d gaze hath power to freeze the blood,\nAnd petrify thee stark and stiff.\nOf course I need not ask you if\nYou've heard of the Medusa's head.\nFaust.\nIn truth I see the eyes of one that's dead,\nOn which no closing hand of love was laid.\nThat is my Margaret's kindly breast,\nThat the sweet body I caressed.\nMephistopheles.\nThere lies the witchcraft o't, thou fool!\nA phantom takes thy wit to school:\nShe is the love of every lover's brain.\nFaust.\nWhat ecstasy! and yet what pain!\nI cannot leave it for my life.\nHow strangely this most lovely neck\nA single streak of red doth deck,\nNo broader than the back o' a knife!\nMephistopheles.\nQuite right! I see it, just as well as you.\nSometimes her head beneath her elbow too\nShe wears; for Perseus cut it off, you know.\nWhat! will you still a-dreaming go?\nCome, let us mount the hillock--there\nWe shall have noble sport, believe me;\nFor, unless mine eyes deceive me,\nThey have got up a theatre.\nWhat make you here?\nA Servant.\nYou are just come in time.\n'Tis a new piece, the last of all the seven,\nFor such the number that with us is given.\nA dilettante 'twas that wrote the rhyme,\nAnd dilettanti are the actors too.\nExcuse me, sirs,--no disrespect to you,\nIf I seem curt: I am the dilettante\nTo draw the curtain; and our time is scanty.\nMephistopheles.\nJust so; I only wish you were so clever\nTo know your home;\nThen from the Blocksberg you would never\nHave lust to roam!",

Must\nit then come to this? Thou treacherous and worthless Spirit! this\nhast thou concealed from me!--Stand thou there! stand!--Roll round\nthy fiendish eyes, infuriate in thy head! Stand and confront me with\nthy insupportable presence. A prisoner! in irredeemable misery! given\nover to evil Spirits, and to the condemning voice of the unfeeling\nworld! and me, meanwhile, thou cradlest to sleep amid a host of the\nmost vapid dissipations, concealing from my knowledge her aggravated\nwoes!--while she--she is left in hopeless wretchedness to die!\nMephistopheles.\nShe's not the first.\nFaust.\nDog! abominable monster!--Change him, O thou infinite Spirit! change\nthe reptile back again into his original form--the poodle that ran\nbefore me in the twilight, now cowering at the feet of the harmless\nwanderer, now springing on his shoulders!--Change him again into his\nfavorite shape, that he may crouch on his belly in the sand before\nme, and I may tramp him underneath my feet, the reprobate!--Not the\nfirst! Misery, misery! by no human soul to be conceived! that more\nthan one creature of God should ever have been plunged into the depth\nof this woe! that the first, in the writhing agony of her death,\nshould not have atoned for the guilt of all the rest before the eyes\nof the All-merciful! It digs even into the marrow of my life, the\nmisery of this _one_; and thou--thou grinnest in cold composure over\nthe wretchedness of thousands!\nMephistopheles.\nHere we are arrived once more at the limit of our wits, where the\nthread of human reason snaps in sunder. Wherefore seekest thou\ncommunion with us, unless thou would'st carry it through? Would'st\nfly, and yet art not proof against giddiness? Did we thrust ourselves\non you, or you on us?\nFaust.\nWhet not thy rows of voracious teeth at me! I loathe it!--Great and\nglorious Spirit, who didst condescend to reveal thyself to me, who\nknowest my heart and my soul, wherefore didst thou yoke me to this\nvilest of complices, who feeds on mischief and banquets on\ndestruction?\nMephistopheles.\nArt done?\nFaust.\nDeliver her! or woe thee!--the direst of curses lie on thee forever!\nMephistopheles.\nI cannot loose the bonds of the avenger, nor open his bars.--Deliver\nher! Who was it that plunged her into ruin? I or thou?\n[/Faust/ _looks wildly round._\nMephistopheles. [_continues_]\nWould'st grasp the thunder? 'Tis well that you, poor mortals, have it\nnot to wield! To smash the innocent in pieces is the proper tyrant's\nfashion of venting one's spleen in a dilemma.\nFaust.\nBring me to her! She shall be free!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd the danger to which thou exposest thyself! Know that the guilt of\nblood from thy hand still lies upon the town. Above the spot where\nthe slain fell, avenging Spirits hover and lie in wait for the\nreturning murderer.\nFaust.\nThat too from thee? Murder and death of a world on thee, thou\nmonster! Bring me to her, I say, and deliver her!\nMephistopheles.\nI'll lead thee thither, and what I can do that I will do. Mark me!\nHave I all power in heaven and on earth? I will cloud the wits of\nthe warder, and thou may'st seize the keys, and bring her out with\nthe hand of a man. I wait for you with the magic horses to ensure\nyour escape.
