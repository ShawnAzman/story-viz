Though the windows of the chamber were\nwide open, and the muslin curtains looped back, not a breath of air was\nstirring. Only the shrill chirp of the cicada and the muffled croaking\nof the frogs in some distant marsh broke the night silence. The heavy\nscent of magnolias, overpowering even the strong smell of drugs in the\nsickroom, suggested death and funeral wreaths, sorrow and tears, the\nlong home, the last sleep. The major shivered with apprehension as the\nslender hand which he held in his own contracted nervously and in a\nspasm of pain clutched his fingers with a viselike grip.\nMajor Carteret, though dressed in brown linen, had thrown off his coat\nfor greater comfort. The stifling heat, in spite of the palm-leaf fan\nwhich he plied mechanically, was scarcely less oppressive than his own\nthoughts. Long ago, while yet a mere boy in years, he had come back from\nAppomattox to find his family, one of the oldest and proudest in the\nstate, hopelessly impoverished by the war,--even their ancestral home\nswallowed up in the common ruin. His elder brother had sacrificed his\nlife on the bloody altar of the lost cause, and his father, broken and\nchagrined, died not many years later, leaving the major the last of his\nline. He had tried in various pursuits to gain a foothold in the new\nlife, but with indifferent success until he won the hand of Olivia\nMerkell, whom he had seen grow from a small girl to glorious womanhood.\nWith her money he had founded the Morning Chronicle, which he had made\nthe leading organ of his party and the most influential paper in the\nState. The fine old house in which they lived was hers. In this very\nroom she had first drawn the breath of life; it had been their nuptial\nchamber; and here, too, within a few hours, she might die, for it seemed\nimpossible that one could long endure such frightful agony and live.\nOne cloud alone had marred the otherwise perfect serenity of their\nhappiness. Olivia was childless. To have children to perpetuate the name\nof which he was so proud, to write it still higher on the roll of\nhonor, had been his dearest hope. His disappointment had been\nproportionately keen. A few months ago this dead hope had revived, and\naltered the whole aspect of their lives. But as time went on, his wife's\nage had begun to tell upon her, until even Dr. Price, the most cheerful\nand optimistic of physicians, had warned him, while hoping for the best,\nto be prepared for the worst.

An old black woman, dressed in a gingham frock, with a red\nbandana handkerchief coiled around her head by way of turban, was seated\nby an open window. She rose and curtsied as the doctor entered and\ndropped into a willow rocking-chair near her own.\n\"How did this happen, Jane?\" he asked in a subdued voice, adding, with\nassumed severity, \"You ought to have taken better care of your\nmistress.\"\n\"Now look a-hyuh, Doctuh Price,\" returned the old woman in an unctuous\nwhisper, \"you don' wanter come talkin' none er yo' foolishness 'bout my\nnot takin' keer er Mis' 'Livy. _She_ never would 'a' said sech a thing!\nSeven er eight mont's ago, w'en she sent fer me, I says ter her, says\nI:--\n\"'Lawd, Lawd, honey!

Why, honey, I nussed you, an'\nnussed yo' mammy thoo her las' sickness, an' laid her out w'en she died.\nI wouldn' _let_ nobody e'se nuss yo' baby; an' mo'over, I'm gwine ter\ncome an' nuss you too. You're young side er me, Mis' 'Livy, but you're\nove'ly ole ter be havin' yo' fus' baby, an' you'll need somebody roun',\nhoney, w'at knows all 'bout de fam'ly, an' deir ways an' deir\nweaknesses, an' I don' know who dat'd be ef it wa'n't me.'\n\"''Deed, Mammy Jane,' says she, 'dere ain' nobody e'se I'd have but you.\nYou kin come ez soon ez you wanter an' stay ez long ez you mineter.'\n\"An hyuh I is, an' hyuh I'm gwine ter stay. Fer Mis' 'Livy is my ole\nmist'ess's daughter, an' my ole mist'ess wuz good ter me, an' dey ain'\nnone er her folks gwine ter suffer ef ole Jane kin he'p it.\"\n\"Your loyalty does you credit, Jane,\" observed the doctor; \"but you\nhaven't told me yet what happened to Mrs. Carteret to-day. Did the horse\nrun away, or did she see something that frightened her?\"\n\"No, suh, de hoss didn' git skeered at nothin', but Mis' 'Livy did see\nsomethin', er somebody; an' it wa'n't no fault er mine ner her'n\nneither,--it goes fu'ther back, suh, fu'ther dan dis day er dis year.\nDoes you 'member de time w'en my ole mist'ess, Mis' 'Livy upstairs's\nmammy, died? No? Well, you wuz prob'ly 'way ter school den, studyin' ter\nbe a doctuh. But I'll tell you all erbout it.\n\"Wen my ole mist'ess, Mis' 'Liz'beth Merkell,--an' a good mist'ess she\nwuz,--tuck sick fer de las' time, her sister Polly--ole Mis' Polly\nOchiltree w'at is now--come ter de house ter he'p nuss her.

She wuz a widder fer de secon' time, an' didn' have no\nchild'en, an' could jes' as well come as not.\n\"But dere wuz trouble after de fune'al, an' it happen' right hyuh in dis\nlib'ary. Mars Sam wuz settin' by de table, w'en Mis' Polly come\ndownstairs, slow an' solemn, an' stood dere in de middle er de flo', all\nin black, till Mars Sam sot a cheer fer her.\n\"'Well, Samuel,' says she, 'now dat we've done all we can fer po'\n'Liz'beth, it only 'mains fer us ter consider Olivia's future.'\n\"Mars Sam nodded his head, but didn' say nothin'.\n\"'I don' need ter tell you,' says she,' dat I am willin' ter carry out\nde wishes er my dead sister, an' sac'ifice my own comfo't, an' make\nmyse'f yo' housekeeper an' yo' child's nuss, fer my dear sister's sake.\nIt wuz her dyin' wish, an' on it I will ac', ef it is also yo'n.'\n\"Mars Sam didn' want Mis' Polly ter come, suh; fur he didn' like Mis'\nPolly. He wuz skeered er Miss Polly.\"\n\"I don't wonder,\" yawned the doctor, \"if she was anything like she is\nnow.\"\n\"Wuss, suh, fer she wuz younger, an' stronger. She always would have her\nsay, no matter 'bout what, an' her own way, no matter who 'posed her.\nShe had already be'n in de house fer a week, an' Mars Sam knowed ef she\nonce come ter stay, she'd be de mist'ess of eve'ybody in it an' him\ntoo. But w'at could he do but say yas?\n\"'Den it is unde'stood, is it,' says Mis' Polly, w'en he had spoke, 'dat\nI am ter take cha'ge er de house?'\n\"'All right, Polly,' says Mars Sam, wid a deep sigh.\n\"Mis' Polly 'lowed he wuz sighin' fer my po' dead mist'ess, fer she didn'\nhave no idee er his feelin's to'ds her,--she alluz did 'low dat all\nde gent'emen wuz in love wid 'er.\n\"'You won' fin' much ter do,' Mars Sam went on, 'fer Julia is a good\nhousekeeper, an' kin ten' ter mos' eve'ything, under yo' d'rections.'\n\"Mis' Polly stiffen' up like a ramrod. 'It mus' be unde'stood, Samuel,'\nsays she, 'dat w'en I 'sumes cha'ge er yo' house, dere ain' gwine ter be\nno 'vided 'sponsibility; an' as fer dis Julia, me an' her couldn' git\n'long tergether nohow. Ef I stays, Julia goes.'\n\"Wen Mars Sam beared dat, he felt better, an' 'mence' ter pick up his\ncourage. Mis' Polly had showed her ban' too plain. My mist'ess hadn'\ngot col' yit, an' Mis' Polly, who'd be'n a widder fer two years dis\nlas' time, wuz already fig'rin' on takin' her place fer good, an' she\ndid n! want no other woman roun' de house dat Mars Sam might take a'\nintrus' in.\n\"'My dear Polly,' says Mars Sam, quite determine', 'I couldn' possibly\nsen' Julia 'way. Fac' is, I couldn' git 'long widout Julia. She'd be'n\nrunnin' dis house like clockwo'k befo' you come, an' I likes her ways.\nMy dear, dead 'Liz'beth sot a heap er sto' by Julia, an' I'm gwine ter\nkeep her here fer 'Liz'beth's sake.'\n\"Mis' Polly's eyes flash' fire.\n\"'Ah,' says she,' I see--I see! You perfers her housekeepin' ter mine,\nindeed! Dat is a fine way ter talk ter a lady! An' a heap er rispec' you\nis got fer de mem'ry er my po' dead sister!'\n\"Mars Sam knowed w'at she 'lowed she seed wa'n't so; but he didn' let\non, fer it only made him de safer. He wuz willin' fer her ter 'magine w'at\nshe please', jes' so long ez she kep' out er his house an' let him\nalone.\n\"'No, Polly,' says he, gittin' bolder ez she got madder, 'dere ain' no\nuse talkin'. Nothin' in de worl' would make me part wid Julia.'\n\"Mis' Polly she r'ared an' she pitch', but Mars Sam helt on like grim\ndeath. Mis' Polly wouldn' give in neither, an' so she fin'lly went\naway. Dey made some kind er 'rangement afterwa'ds, an' Miss Polly tuck\nMis' 'Livy ter her own house. Mars Sam paid her bo'd an' 'lowed Mis'\nPolly somethin' fer takin' keer er her.\"\n\"And Julia stayed?\"\n\"Julia stayed, suh, an' a couple er years later her chile wuz bawn,\nright here in dis house.\"\n\"But you said,\" observed the doctor, \"that Mrs. Ochiltree was in error\nabout Julia.\"\n\"Yas, suh, so she wuz, w'en my ole mist'ess died. But dis wuz two years\nafter,--an' w'at has ter be has ter be. Julia had a easy time; she had a\nblack gal ter wait on her, a buggy to ride in, an' eve'ything she\nwanted. Eve'ybody s'posed Mars Sam would give her a house an' lot, er\nleave her somethin' in his will. But he died suddenly, and didn' leave\nno will, an' Mis' Polly got herse'f 'pinted gyardeen ter young Mis'\n'Livy, an' driv Julia an' her young un out er de house, an' lived here\nin dis house wid Mis' 'Livy till Mis' 'Livy ma'ied Majah Carteret.\"\n\"And what became of Julia?\" asked Dr. Price.\nSuch relations, the doctor knew very well, had been all too common in\nthe old slavery days, and not a few of them had been projected into the\nnew era. Sins, like snakes, die hard. The habits and customs of a people\nwere not to be changed in a day, nor by the stroke of a pen. As family\nphysician, and father confessor by brevet, Dr. Price had looked upon\nmore than one hidden skeleton; and no one in town had had better\nopportunities than old Jane for learning the undercurrents in the lives\nof the old families.\n\"Well,\" resumed Jane, \"eve'ybody s'posed, after w'at had happen', dat\nJulia'd keep on livin' easy, fer she wuz young an' good-lookin'. But\nshe didn'. She tried ter make a livin' sewin', but Mis' Polly wouldn'\nlet de bes' w'ite folks hire her. Den she tuck up washin', but didn' do\nno better at dat; an' bimeby she got so discourage' dat she ma'ied a\nshif'less yaller man, an' died er consumption soon after,--an' wuz\n'bout ez well off, fer dis man couldn' hardly feed her nohow.\"\n\"And the child?\"\n\"One er de No'the'n w'ite lady teachers at de mission school tuck a\nlikin' ter little Janet, an' put her thoo school, an' den sent her off\nter de No'th fer ter study ter be a school teacher. W'en she come back,\n'stead er teachin' she ma'ied ole Adam Miller's son.\"\n\"The rich stevedore's son, Dr. Miller?\"\n\"Yas, suh, dat's de man,--you knows 'im. Dis yer boy wuz jes' gwine\n'way fer ter study ter be a doctuh, an' he ma'ied dis Janet, an' tuck\nher 'way wid 'im. Dey went off ter Europe, er Irope, er Orope, er\nsomewhere er 'nother, 'way off yander, an' come back here las' year an'\nsta'ted dis yer horspital an' school fer ter train de black gals fer\nnusses.\"\n\"He's a very good doctor, Jane, and is doing a useful work. Your\nchapter of family history is quite interesting,--I knew part of it\nbefore, in a general way; but you haven't yet told me what brought on\nMrs. Carteret's trouble.\"\n\"I'm jes' comin' ter dat dis minute, suh,--w'at I be'n tellin' you is\nall a part of it. Dis yer Janet, w'at's Mis' 'Livy's half-sister, is ez\nmuch like her ez ef dey wuz twins. Folks sometimes takes 'em fer one\nernudder,--I s'pose it tickles Janet mos' ter death, but it do make Mis'\n'Livy rippin'. An' den 'way back yander jes' after de wah, w'en de ole\nCarteret mansion had ter be sol', Adam Miller bought it, an' dis yer\nJanet an' her husban' is be'n livin' in it ever sence ole Adam died,\n'bout a year ago; an' dat makes de majah mad, 'ca'se he don' wanter see\ncullud folks livin' in de ole fam'ly mansion w'at he wuz bawn in. An'\nmo'over, an' dat's de wust of all, w'iles Mis' 'Livy ain' had no\nchild'en befo', dis yer sister er her'n is got a fine-lookin' little\nyaller boy, w'at favors de fam'ly so dat ef Mis' 'Livy'd see de chile\nanywhere, it'd mos' break her heart fer ter think 'bout her not havin'\nno child'en herse'f. So ter-day, w'en Mis' 'Livy wuz out ridin' an' met\ndis yer Janet wid her boy, an' w'en Mis' 'Livy got ter studyin' 'bout\nher own chances, an' how she mought not come thoo safe, she jes' had a\nfit er hysterics right dere in de buggy. She wuz mos' home, an' William\ngot her here, an' you knows de res'.\"",

The child was born at dawn. Both mother and child, the doctor\nsaid, would live.\n\"Bless its 'ittle hea't!\" exclaimed Mammy Jane, as she held up the tiny\nmite, which bore as much resemblance to mature humanity as might be\nexpected of an infant which had for only a few minutes drawn the breath\nof life. \"Bless its 'ittle hea't! it's de we'y spit an' image er its\npappy!\"\nThe doctor smiled. The major laughed aloud. Jane's unconscious\nwitticism, or conscious flattery, whichever it might be, was a welcome\ndiversion from the tense strain of the last few hours.\n\"Be that as it may,\" said Dr. Price cheerfully, \"and I'll not dispute\nit, the child is a very fine boy,--a very fine boy, indeed! Take care of\nit, major,\" he added with a touch of solemnity, \"for your wife can never\nbear another.\"\nWith the child's first cry a refreshing breeze from the distant ocean\ncooled the hot air of the chamber; the heavy odor of the magnolias, with\nits mortuary suggestiveness, gave place to the scent of rose and lilac\nand honeysuckle. The birds in the garden were singing lustily.\nAll these sweet and pleasant things found an echo in the major's heart.\nHe stood by the window, and looking toward the rising sun, breathed a\nsilent prayer of thanksgiving. All nature seemed to rejoice in sympathy\nwith his happiness at the fruition of this long-deferred hope, and to\npredict for this wonderful child a bright and glorious future.\nOld Mammy Jane, however, was not entirely at ease concerning the child.\nShe had discovered, under its left ear, a small mole, which led her to\nfear that the child was born for bad luck. Had the baby been black, or\nyellow, or poor-white, Jane would unhesitatingly have named, as his\nultimate fate, a not uncommon form of taking off, usually resultant upon\nthe infraction of certain laws, or, in these swift modern days, upon too\nviolent a departure from established social customs. It was manifestly\nimpossible that a child of such high quality as the grandson of her old\nmistress should die by judicial strangulation; but nevertheless the\nwarning was a serious thing, and not to be lightly disregarded.\nNot wishing to be considered as a prophet of evil omen, Jane kept her\nown counsel in regard to this significant discovery. But later, after\nthe child was several days old, she filled a small vial with water in\nwhich the infant had been washed, and took it to a certain wise old\nblack woman, who lived on the farther edge of the town and was well\nknown to be versed in witchcraft and conjuration. The conjure woman\nadded to the contents of the bottle a bit of calamus root, and one of\nthe cervical vertebrae from the skeleton of a black cat, with several\nother mysterious ingredients, the nature of which she did not disclose.\nFollowing instructions given her, Aunt Jane buried the bottle in\nCarteret's back yard, one night during the full moon, as a good-luck\ncharm to ward off evil from the little grandson of her dear mistress, so",

      "text": "The table was tastefully decorated with flowers, which grew about the\nhouse in lavish profusion. In warm climates nature adorns herself with\ntrue feminine vanity.\n\"What a beautiful table!\" exclaimed Tom, before they were seated.\n\"The decorations are mine,\" said Clara proudly. \"I cut the flowers and\narranged them all myself.\"\n\"Which accounts for the admirable effect,\" rejoined Tom with a bow,\nbefore Ellis, to whom the same thought had occurred, was able to express\nhimself. He had always counted himself the least envious of men, but for\nthis occasion he coveted Tom Delamere's readiness.\n\"The beauty of the flowers,\" observed old Mr. Delamere, with sententious\ngallantry, \"is reflected upon all around them. It is a handsome\ncompany.\"\nMrs. Ochiltree beamed upon the table with a dry smile.\n\"I don't perceive any effect that it has upon you or me,\" she said; \"And\nas for the young people, 'Handsome is as handsome does.' If Tom here,\nfor instance, were as good as he looks\"--\n\"You flatter me, Aunt Polly,\" Tom broke in hastily, anticipating the\ncrack of the whip; he was familiar with his aunt's conversational\nidiosyncrasies.\n\"If you are as good as you look,\" continued the old lady, with a cunning\nbut indulgent smile, \"some one has been slandering you.\"\n\"Thanks, Aunt Polly! Now you don't flatter me.\"\n\"There is Mr. Ellis,\" Mrs. Ochiltree went on, \"who is not half so\ngood-looking, but is steady as a clock, I dare say.\"\n\"Now, Aunt Polly,\" interposed Mrs. Carteret, \"let the gentlemen alone.\"\n\"She doesn't mean half what she says,\" continued Mrs. Carteret\napologetically, \"and only talks that way to people whom she likes.\"\nTom threw Mrs. Carteret a grateful glance. He had been apprehensive,\nwith the sensitiveness of youth, lest his old great-aunt should make a\nfool of him before Clara's family. Nor had he relished the comparison\nwith Ellis, who was out of place, anyway, in this family party. He had\nnever liked the fellow, who was too much of a plodder and a prig to make\na suitable associate for a whole-souled, generous-hearted young\ngentleman. He tolerated him as a visitor at Carteret's and as a member\nof the Clarendon Club, but that was all.\n\"Mrs. Ochiltree has a characteristic way of disguising her feelings,\"\nobserved old Mr. Delamere, with a touch of sarcasm.\nEllis had merely flushed and felt uncomfortable at the reference to\nhimself. The compliment to his character hardly offset the reflection\nupon his looks. He knew he was not exactly handsome, but it was not\npleasant to have the fact emphasized in the presence of the girl he\nloved; he would like at least fair play, and judgment upon the subject\nleft to the young lady.\nMrs. Ochiltree was quietly enjoying herself. In early life she had been\naccustomed to impale fools on epigrams, like flies on pins, to see them\nwriggle. But with advancing years she had lost in some measure the\nfaculty of nice discrimination,--it was pleasant to see her victims\nsquirm, whether they were fools or friends. Even one's friends, she\nargued, were not always wise, and were sometimes the better for being\ntold the truth. At her niece's table she felt at liberty to speak her\nmind, which she invariably did, with a frankness that sometimes bordered\non brutality. She had long ago outgrown the period where ambition or\npassion, or its partners, envy and hatred, were springs of action in her\nlife, and simply retained a mild enjoyment in the exercise of an old\nhabit, with no active malice whatever. The ruling passion merely grew\nstronger as the restraining faculties decreased in vigor.\nA diversion was created at this point by the appearance of old Mammy\nJane, dressed in a calico frock, with clean white neckerchief and apron,\ncarrying the wonderful baby in honor of whose naming this feast had been\ngiven. Though only six weeks old, the little Theodore had grown rapidly,\nand Mammy Jane declared was already quite large for his age, and\ndisplayed signs of an unusually precocious intelligence. He was passed\naround the table and duly admired. Clara thought his hair was fine.\nEllis inquired about his teeth. Tom put his finger in the baby's fist to\ntest his grip. Old Mr. Delamere was unable to decide as yet whether he\nfavored most his father or his mother. The object of these attentions\nendured them patiently for several minutes, and then protested with a\nvocal vigor which led to his being taken promptly back upstairs.\nWhatever fate might be in store for him, he manifested no sign of weak\nlungs.\n\"Sandy,\" said Mrs. Carteret when the baby had retired, \"pass that tray\nstanding upon the side table, so that we may all see the presents.\"\nMr. Delamere had brought a silver spoon, and Tom a napkin ring. Ellis\nhad sent a silver watch; it was a little premature, he admitted, but\nthe boy would grow to it, and could use it to play with in the mean\ntime. It had a glass back, so that he might see the wheels go round.\nMrs. Ochiltree's present was an old and yellow ivory rattle, with a\nhandle which the child could bite while teething, and a knob screwed on\nat the end to prevent the handle from slipping through the baby's hand.\n\"I saw that in your cedar chest, Aunt Polly,\" said Clara, \"when I was a\nlittle girl, and you used to pull the chest out from under your bed to\nget me a dime.\"\n\"You kept the rattle in the right-hand corner of the chest,\" said Tom,\n\"in the box with the red silk purse, from which you took the gold piece\nyou gave me every Christmas.\"\nA smile shone on Mrs. Ochiltree's severe features at this appreciation,\nlike a ray of sunlight on a snowbank.\n\"Aunt Polly's chest is like the widow's cruse,\" said Mrs. Carteret,\n\"which was never empty.\"\n\"Or Fortunatus's purse, which was always full,\" added old Mr. Delamere,\nwho read the Latin poets, and whose allusions were apt to be classical\nrather than scriptural.\n\"It will last me while I live,\" said Mrs. Ochiltree, adding cautiously,\n\"but there'll not be a great deal left. It won't take much to support\nan old woman for twenty years.\"\nMr. Delamere's man Sandy had been waiting upon the table with the\ndecorum of a trained butler, and a gravity all his own. He had changed\nhis suit of plain gray for a long blue coat with brass buttons, which\ndated back to the fashion of a former generation, with which he wore a\npair of plaid trousers of strikingly modern cut and pattern. With his\nwhiskers, his spectacles, and his solemn air of responsibility, he would\nhave presented, to one unfamiliar with the negro type, an amusingly\nimpressive appearance. But there was nothing incongruous about Sandy to\nthis company, except perhaps to Tom Delamere, who possessed a keen eye\nfor contrasts and always regarded Sandy, in that particular rig, as a\nvery comical darkey.\n\"Is it quite prudent, Mrs. Ochiltree,\" suggested the major at a moment\nwhen Sandy, having set down the tray, had left the room for a little\nwhile, \"to mention, in the presence of the servants, that you keep money\nin the house?\"\n\"I beg your pardon, major,\" observed old Mr. Delamere, with a touch of\nstiffness. \"The only servant in hearing of the conversation has been my\nown; and Sandy is as honest as any man in Wellington.\"\n\"You mean, sir,\" replied Carteret, with a smile, \"as honest as any negro\nin Wellington.\"\n\"I make no exceptions, major,\" returned the old gentleman, with\nemphasis. \"I would trust Sandy with my life,--he saved it once at the\nrisk of his own.\"\n\"No doubt,\" mused the major, \"the negro is capable of a certain doglike\nfidelity,--I make the comparison in a kindly sense,--a certain personal\ndevotion which is admirable in itself, and fits him eminently for a\nservile career. I should imagine, however, that one could more safely\ntrust his life with a negro than his portable property.\"\n\"Very clever, major! I read your paper, and know that your feeling is\nhostile toward the negro, but\"--\nThe major made a gesture of dissent, but remained courteously silent\nuntil Mr. Delamere had finished.\n\"For my part,\" the old gentleman went on, \"I think they have done very\nwell, considering what they started from, and their limited\nopportunities. There was Adam Miller, for instance, who left a\ncomfortable estate. His son George carries on the business, and the\nyounger boy, William, is a good doctor and stands well with his\nprofession. His hospital is a good thing, and if my estate were clear, I\nshould like to do something for it.\"\n\"You are mistaken, sir, in imagining me hostile to the negro,\" explained\nCarteret. \"On the contrary, I am friendly to his best interests. I give\nhim employment; I pay taxes for schools to educate him, and for\ncourt-houses and jails to keep him in order. I merely object to being\ngoverned by an inferior and servile race.\"\nMrs. Carteret's face wore a tired expression. This question was her\nhusband's hobby, and therefore her own nightmare. Moreover, she had her\npersonal grievance against the negro race, and the names mentioned by\nold Mr. Delamere had brought it vividly before her mind. She had no\ndesire to mar the harmony of the occasion by the discussion of a\ndistasteful subject.\nMr. Delamere, glancing at his hostess, read something of this thought,\nand refused the challenge to further argument.\n\"I do not believe, major,\" he said, \"that Olivia relishes the topic. I\nmerely wish to say that Sandy is an exception to any rule which you may\nformulate in derogation of the negro. Sandy is a gentleman in ebony!\"\nTom could scarcely preserve his gravity at this characterization of old\nSandy, with his ridiculous air of importance, his long blue coat, and\nhis loud plaid trousers. That suit would make a great costume for a\nmasquerade. He would borrow it some time,--there was nothing in the\nworld like it.\n\"Well, Mr. Delamere,\" returned the major good-humoredly, \"no doubt Sandy\nis an exceptionally good negro,--he might well be, for he has had the\nbenefit of your example all his life,--and we know that he is a faithful\nservant. But nevertheless, if I were Mrs. Ochiltree, I should put my\nmoney in the bank. Not all negroes are as honest as Sandy, and an\nelderly lady might not prove a match for a burly black burglar.\"\n\"Thank you, major,\" retorted Mrs. Ochiltree, with spirit, \"I'm not yet\ntoo old to take care of myself. That cedar chest has been my bank for\nforty years, and I shall not change my habits at my age.\"\nAt this moment Sandy re\u00ebntered the room. Carteret made a warning\ngesture, which Mrs. Ochiltree chose not to notice.\n\"I've proved a match for two husbands, and am not afraid of any man\nthat walks the earth, black or white, by day or night. I have a\nrevolver, and know how to use it. Whoever attempts to rob me will do so\nat his peril.\"\nAfter dinner Clara played the piano and sang duets with Tom Delamere. At",

      "text": "Having finished this pleasant ceremony, which left him with a\ncomfortable sense of his new dignity, the major turned to his desk. It\nhad been much neglected during the week, and more than one matter\nclaimed his attention; but as typical of the new trend of his thoughts,\nthe first subject he took up was one bearing upon the future of his son.\nQuite obviously the career of a Carteret must not be left to chance,--it\nmust be planned and worked out with a due sense of the value of good\nblood.\nThere lay upon his desk a letter from a well-known promoter, offering\nthe major an investment which promised large returns, though several\nyears must elapse before the enterprise could be put upon a paying\nbasis. The element of time, however, was not immediately important. The\nMorning Chronicle provided him an ample income. The money available for\nthis investment was part of his wife's patrimony. It was invested in a\nlocal cotton mill, which was paying ten per cent., but this was a\nbeggarly return compared with the immense profits promised by the\noffered investment,--profits which would enable his son, upon reaching\nmanhood, to take a place in the world commensurate with the dignity of\nhis ancestors, one of whom, only a few generations removed, had owned an\nestate of ninety thousand acres of land and six thousand slaves.\nThis letter having been disposed of by an answer accepting the offer,\nthe major took up his pen to write an editorial. Public affairs in the\nstate were not going to his satisfaction. At the last state election his\nown party, after an almost unbroken rule of twenty years, had been\ndefeated by the so-called \"Fusion\" ticket, a combination of Republicans\nand Populists. A clean sweep had been made of the offices in the state,\nwhich were now filled by new men. Many of the smaller places had gone to\ncolored men, their people having voted almost solidly for the Fusion\nticket. In spite of the fact that the population of Wellington was two\nthirds colored, this state of things was gall and wormwood to the\ndefeated party, of which the Morning Chronicle was the acknowledged\norgan. Major Carteret shared this feeling. Only this very morning, while\npassing the city hall, on his way to the office, he had seen the steps\nof that noble building disfigured by a fringe of job-hunting negroes,\nfor all the world--to use a local simile--like a string of buzzards\nsitting on a rail, awaiting their opportunity to batten upon the\nhelpless corpse of a moribund city.\nTaking for his theme the unfitness of the negro to participate in\ngovernment,--an unfitness due to his limited education, his lack of\nexperience, his criminal tendencies, and more especially to his hopeless\nmental and physical inferiority to the white race,--the major had\ndemonstrated, it seemed to him clearly enough, that the ballot in the\nhands of the negro was a menace to the commonwealth. He had argued, with\nentire conviction, that the white and black races could never attain\nsocial and political harmony by commingling their blood; he had proved\nby several historical parallels that no two unassimilable races could\never live together except in the relation of superior and inferior; and\nhe was just dipping his gold pen into the ink to indite his conclusions\nfrom the premises thus established, when Jerry, the porter, announced",

He wore a frock\ncoat, patent leather shoes, and a Panama hat. There were crow's-feet\nabout his eyes, which twinkled with a hard and, at times, humorous\nshrewdness. He had sloping shoulders, small hands and feet, and walked\nwith the leisurely step characteristic of those who have been reared\nunder hot suns.\nCarteret gave his hand cordially to the gentleman thus described.\n\"How do you do, Captain McBane,\" he said, turning to the second visitor.\nThe individual thus addressed was strikingly different in appearance\nfrom his companion. His broad shoulders, burly form, square jaw, and\nheavy chin betokened strength, energy, and unscrupulousness. With the\nexception of a small, bristling mustache, his face was clean shaven,\nwith here and there a speck of dried blood due to a carelessly or\nunskillfully handled razor. A single deep-set gray eye was shadowed by a\nbeetling brow, over which a crop of coarse black hair, slightly streaked\nwith gray, fell almost low enough to mingle with his black, bushy\neyebrows. His coat had not been brushed for several days, if one might\njudge from the accumulation of dandruff upon the collar, and his\nshirt-front, in the middle of which blazed a showy diamond, was\nplentifully stained with tobacco juice. He wore a large slouch hat,\nwhich, upon entering the office, he removed and held in his hand.\nHaving greeted this person with an unconscious but quite perceptible\ndiminution of the warmth with which he had welcomed the other, the major\nlooked around the room for seats for his visitors, and perceiving only\none chair, piled with exchanges, and a broken stool propped against the\nwall, pushed a button, which rang a bell in the hall, summoning the\ncolored porter to his presence.\n\"Jerry,\" said the editor when his servant appeared, \"bring a couple of\nchairs for these gentlemen.\"\nWhile they stood waiting, the visitors congratulated the major on the\nbirth of his child, which had been announced in the Morning Chronicle,\nand which the prominence of the family made in some degree a matter of\npublic interest.\n\"And now that you have a son, major,\" remarked the gentleman first\ndescribed, as he lit one of the major's cigars, \"you'll be all the more\ninterested in doing something to make this town fit to live in, which is\nwhat we came up to talk about. Things are in an awful condition! A negro",

      "text": "justice of the peace has opened an office on Market Street, and only\nyesterday summoned a white man to appear before him. Negro lawyers get\nmost of the business in the criminal court. Last evening a group of\nyoung white ladies, going quietly along the street arm-in-arm, were\nforced off the sidewalk by a crowd of negro girls. Coming down the\nstreet just now, I saw a spectacle of social equality and negro\ndomination that made my blood boil with indignation,--a white and a\nblack convict, chained together, crossing the city in charge of a negro\nofficer! We cannot stand that sort of thing, Carteret,--it is the last\nstraw! Something must be done, and that quickly!\"\nThe major thrilled with responsive emotion. There was something\nprophetic in this opportune visit. The matter was not only in his own\nthoughts, but in the air; it was the spontaneous revulsion of white men\nagainst the rule of an inferior race. These were the very men, above all\nothers in the town, to join him in a movement to change these degrading\nconditions.\nGeneral Belmont, the smaller of the two, was a man of good family, a\nlawyer by profession, and took an active part in state and local\npolitics. Aristocratic by birth and instinct, and a former owner of\nslaves, his conception of the obligations and rights of his caste was\nnevertheless somewhat lower than that of the narrower but more sincere\nCarteret. In serious affairs Carteret desired the approval of his\nconscience, even if he had to trick that docile organ into\nacquiescence. This was not difficult to do in politics, for he believed\nin the divine right of white men and gentlemen, as his ancestors had\nbelieved in and died for the divine right of kings. General Belmont was\nnot without a gentleman's distaste for meanness, but he permitted no\nfine scruples to stand in the way of success. He had once been minister,\nunder a Democratic administration, to a small Central American state.\nPolitical rivals had characterized him as a tricky demagogue, which may\nof course have been a libel. He had an amiable disposition, possessed\nthe gift of eloquence, and was a prime social favorite.\nCaptain George McBane had sprung from the poor-white class, to which,\neven more than to the slaves, the abolition of slavery had opened the\ndoor of opportunity. No longer overshadowed by a slaveholding caste,\nsome of this class had rapidly pushed themselves forward. Some had made\nhonorable records. Others, foremost in negro-baiting and election\nfrauds, had done the dirty work of politics, as their fathers had done\nthat of slavery, seeking their reward at first in minor offices,--for\nwhich men of gentler breeding did not care,--until their ambition began\nto reach out for higher honors.\nOf this class McBane--whose captaincy, by the way, was merely a polite\nfiction--had been one of the most successful. He had held, until\nrecently, as the reward of questionable political services, a contract\nwith the State for its convict labor, from which in a few years he had\nrealized a fortune. But the methods which made his contract profitable\nhad not commended themselves to humane people, and charges of cruelty\nand worse had been preferred against him. He was rich enough to escape\nserious consequences from the investigation which followed, but when the\nFusion ticket carried the state he lost his contract, and the system of\nconvict labor was abolished. Since then McBane had devoted himself to\npolitics: he was ambitious for greater wealth, for office, and for\nsocial recognition. A man of few words and self-engrossed, he seldom\nspoke of his aspirations except where speech might favor them,\npreferring to seek his ends by secret \"deals\" and combinations rather\nthan to challenge criticism and provoke rivalry by more open methods.\nAt sight, therefore, of these two men, with whose careers and characters\nhe was entirely familiar, Carteret felt sweep over his mind the\nconviction that now was the time and these the instruments with which to\nundertake the redemption of the state from the evil fate which had\nbefallen it.",

      "text": "Jerry, the porter, who had gone downstairs to the counting-room to find\ntwo whole chairs, now entered with one in each hand. He set a chair for\nthe general, who gave him an amiable nod, to which Jerry responded with\na bow and a scrape. Captain McBane made no acknowledgment, but fixed\nJerry so fiercely with his single eye that upon placing the chair Jerry\nmade his escape from the room as rapidly as possible.\n\"I don' like dat Cap'n McBane,\" he muttered, upon reaching the hall.\n\"Dey says he got dat eye knock' out tryin' ter whip a cullud 'oman, when\nhe wuz a boy, an' dat he ain' never had no use fer niggers\nsence,--'cep'n' fer what he could make outen 'em wid his convic' labor\ncontrac's. His daddy wuz a' overseer befo' 'im, an' it come nachul fer\nhim ter be a nigger-driver. I don' want dat one eye er his'n restin' on\nme no longer 'n I kin he'p, an' I don' know how I'm gwine ter like dis\njob ef he's gwine ter be comin' roun' here. He ain' nothin' but po'\nw'ite trash nohow; but Lawd! Lawd! look at de money he's got,--livin'\nat de hotel, wearin' di'mon's, an' colloguin' wid de bes' quality er dis\ntown! 'Pears ter me de bottom rail is gittin' mighty close ter de top.\nWell, I s'pose it all comes f'm bein' w'ite. I wush ter Gawd I wuz\nw'ite!\"\nAfter this fervent aspiration, having nothing else to do for the time\nbeing, except to remain within call, and having caught a few words of\nthe conversation as he went in with the chairs, Jerry, who possessed a\ncertain amount of curiosity, placed close to the wall the broken stool\nupon which he sat while waiting in the hall, and applied his ear to a\nhole in the plastering of the hallway. There was a similar defect in the\ninner wall, between the same two pieces of studding, and while this\ninner opening was not exactly opposite the outer, Jerry was enabled,\nthrough the two, to catch in a more or less fragmentary way what was\ngoing on within.\nHe could hear the major, now and then, use the word \"negro,\" and\nMcBane's deep voice was quite audible when he referred, it seemed to\nJerry with alarming frequency, to \"the damned niggers,\" while the\ngeneral's suave tones now and then pronounced the word \"niggro,\"--a sort\nof compromise between ethnology and the vernacular. That the gentlemen\nwere talking politics seemed quite likely, for gentlemen generally\ntalked politics when they met at the Chronicle office. Jerry could hear\nthe words \"vote,\" \"franchise,\" \"eliminate,\" \"constitution,\" and other\nexpressions which marked the general tenor of the talk, though he could\nnot follow it all,--partly because he could not hear everything\ndistinctly, and partly because of certain limitations which nature had\nplaced in the way of Jerry's understanding anything very difficult or\nabstruse.\nHe had gathered enough, however, to realize, in a vague way, that\nsomething serious was on foot, involving his own race, when a bell\nsounded over his head, at which he sprang up hastily and entered the\nroom where the gentlemen were talking.\n\"Jerry,\" said the major, \"wait on Captain McBane.\"\n\"Yas, suh,\" responded Jerry, turning toward the captain, whose eye he\ncarefully avoided meeting directly.\n\"Take that half a dollar, boy,\" ordered McBane, \"an' go 'cross the\nstreet to Mr. Sykes's, and tell him to send me three whiskies. Bring\nback the change, and make has'e.\"\nThe captain tossed the half dollar at Jerry, who, looking to one side,\nof course missed it. He picked the money up, however, and backed out of\nthe room. Jerry did not like Captain McBane, to begin with, and it was\nclear that the captain was no gentleman, or he would not have thrown the\nmoney at him. Considering the source, Jerry might have overlooked this\ndiscourtesy had it not been coupled with the remark about the change,\nwhich seemed to him in very poor taste.\nReturning in a few minutes with three glasses on a tray, he passed them\nround, handed Captain McBane his change, and retired to the hall.\n\"Gentlemen,\" exclaimed the captain, lifting his glass, \"I propose a\ntoast: 'No nigger domination.'\"\n\"Amen!\" said the others, and three glasses were solemnly drained.\n\"Major,\" observed the general, smacking his lips, \"_I_ should like to\nuse Jerry for a moment, if you will permit me.\"\nJerry appeared promptly at the sound of the bell. He had remained\nconveniently near,--calls of this sort were apt to come in sequence.\n\"Jerry,\" said the general, handing Jerry half a dollar, \"go over to Mr.\nBrown's,--I get my liquor there,--and tell them to send me three glasses\nof my special mixture. And, Jerry,--you may keep the change!\"\n\"Thank y', gin'l, thank y', marster,\" replied Jerry, with unctuous\ngratitude, bending almost double as he backed out of the room.\n\"Dat's a gent'eman, a rale ole-time gent'eman,\" he said to himself when\nhe had closed the door. \"But dere's somethin' gwine on in dere,--dere\nsho' is! 'No nigger damnation!' Dat soun's all right,--I'm sho' dere\nain' no nigger I knows w'at wants damnation, do' dere's lots of 'em w'at\ndeserves it; but ef dat one-eyed Cap'n McBane got anything ter do wid\nit, w'atever it is, it don' mean no good fer de niggers,--damnation'd\nbe better fer 'em dan dat Cap'n McBane!

The nurse belonged to the\nyounger generation of colored people. She had graduated from the mission\nschool, and had received some instruction in Dr. Miller's class for\nnurses. Standing, like most young people of her race, on the border line\nbetween two irreconcilable states of life, she had neither the\npicturesqueness of the slave, nor the unconscious dignity of those of\nwhom freedom has been the immemorial birthright; she was in what might\nbe called the chip-on-the-shoulder stage, through which races as well as\nindividuals must pass in climbing the ladder of life,--not an\ninteresting, at least not an agreeable stage, but an inevitable one, and\nfor that reason entitled to a paragraph in a story of Southern life,\nwhich, with its as yet imperfect blending of old with new, of race with\nrace, of slavery with freedom, is like no other life under the sun.\nHad this old woman, who had no authority over her, been a little more\npolite, or a little less offensive, the nurse might have returned her a\npleasant answer. These old-time negroes, she said to herself, made her\nsick with their slavering over the white folks, who, she supposed,\nfavored them and made much of them because they had once belonged to\nthem,--much the same reason why they fondled their cats and dogs. For\nher own part, they gave her nothing but her wages, and small wages at\nthat, and she owed them nothing more than equivalent service. It was\npurely a matter of business; she sold her time for their money. There\nwas no question of love between them.\nReceiving a negative answer from Mrs. Carteret, she left the room\nwithout a word, ignoring Mammy Jane completely, and leaving that\nvenerable relic of ante-bellum times gasping in helpless astonishment.",

The major was always kind and considerate to these old\nfamily retainers, brought up in the feudal atmosphere now so rapidly\npassing away. Mammy Jane loved Mrs. Carteret; toward the major she\nentertained a feeling bordering upon awe.\n\"Well, Jane,\" returned the major sadly, when the old nurse had related\nher grievance, \"the old times have vanished, the old ties have been\nruptured. The old relations of dependence and loyal obedience on the\npart of the colored people, the responsibility of protection and\nkindness upon that of the whites, have passed away forever.

The child\nwas born for bad luck. The mole under its ear, just at the point where\nthe hangman's knot would strike, had foreshadowed dire misfortune. She\nhad already observed several little things which had rendered her\nvaguely anxious.\nFor instance, upon one occasion, on entering the room where the baby had\nbeen left alone, asleep in his crib, she had met a strange cat hurrying\nfrom the nursery, and, upon examining closely the pillow upon which the\nchild lay, had found a depression which had undoubtedly been due to the\nweight of the cat's body. The child was restless and uneasy, and Jane\nhad ever since believed that the cat had been sucking little Dodie's\nbreath, with what might have been fatal results had she not appeared\njust in the nick of time.\nThis untimely accident of the rattle, a fatality for which no one could\nbe held responsible, had confirmed the unlucky omen. Jane's duties in\nthe nursery did not permit her to visit her friend the conjure woman;\nbut she did find time to go out in the back yard at dusk, and to dig up\nthe charm which she had planted there. It had protected the child so\nfar; but perhaps its potency had become exhausted. She picked up the\nbottle, shook it vigorously, and then laid it back, with the other side\nup. Refilling the hole, she made a cross over the top with the thumb of\nher left hand, and walked three times around it.\nWhat this strange symbolism meant, or whence it derived its origin, Aunt\nJane did not know. The cross was there, and the Trinity, though Jane was\nscarcely conscious of these, at this moment, as religious emblems. But\nshe hoped, on general principles, that this performance would strengthen\nthe charm and restore little Dodie's luck. It certainly had its moral\neffect upon Jane's own mind, for she was able to sleep better, and\ncontrived to impress Mrs. Carteret with her own hopefulness.",

      "text": "As the south-bound train was leaving the station at Philadelphia, a\ngentleman took his seat in the single sleeping-car attached to the\ntrain, and proceeded to make himself comfortable. He hung up his hat and\nopened his newspaper, in which he remained absorbed for a quarter of an\nhour. When the train had left the city behind, he threw the paper aside,\nand looked around at the other occupants of the car. One of these, who\nhad been on the car since it had left New York, rose from his seat upon\nperceiving the other's glance, and came down the aisle.\n\"How do you do, Dr. Burns?\" he said, stopping beside the seat of the\nPhiladelphia passenger.\nThe gentleman looked up at the speaker with an air of surprise, which,\nafter the first keen, incisive glance, gave place to an expression of\ncordial recognition.\n\"Why, it's Miller!\" he exclaimed, rising and giving the other his hand,\n\"William Miller--Dr. Miller, of course. Sit down, Miller, and tell me\nall about yourself,--what you're doing, where you've been, and where\nyou're going. I'm delighted to meet you, and to see you looking so\nwell--and so prosperous.\"\n\"I deserve no credit for either, sir,\" returned the other, as he took\nthe proffered seat, \"for I inherited both health and prosperity. It is a\nfortunate chance that permits me to meet you.\"\nThe two acquaintances, thus opportunely thrown together so that they\nmight while away in conversation the tedium of their journey,\nrepresented very different and yet very similar types of manhood. A\ncelebrated traveler, after many years spent in barbarous or savage\nlands, has said that among all varieties of mankind the similarities are\nvastly more important and fundamental than the differences. Looking at\nthese two men with the American eye, the differences would perhaps be\nthe more striking, or at least the more immediately apparent, for the\nfirst was white and the second black, or, more correctly speaking,\nbrown; it was even a light brown, but both his swarthy complexion and\nhis curly hair revealed what has been described in the laws of some of\nour states as a \"visible admixture\" of African blood.\nHaving disposed of this difference, and having observed that the white\nman was perhaps fifty years of age and the other not more than thirty,\nit may be said that they were both tall and sturdy, both well dressed,\nthe white man with perhaps a little more distinction; both seemed from\ntheir faces and their manners to be men of culture and accustomed to the\nsociety of cultivated people. They were both handsome men, the elder\nrepresenting a fine type of Anglo-Saxon, as the term is used in speaking\nof our composite white population; while the mulatto's erect form, broad\nshoulders, clear eyes, fine teeth, and pleasingly moulded features\nshowed nowhere any sign of that degeneration which the pessimist so\nsadly maintains is the inevitable heritage of mixed races.\nAs to their personal relations, it has already appeared that they were\nmembers of the same profession. In past years they had been teacher and\npupil. Dr. Alvin Burns was professor in the famous medical college\nwhere Miller had attended lectures. The professor had taken an interest\nin his only colored pupil, to whom he had been attracted by his\nearnestness of purpose, his evident talent, and his excellent manners\nand fine physique. It was in part due to Dr. Burns's friendship that\nMiller had won a scholarship which had enabled him, without drawing too\nheavily upon his father's resources, to spend in Europe, studying in the\nhospitals of Paris and Vienna, the two most delightful years of his\nlife. The same influence had strengthened his natural inclination toward\noperative surgery, in which Dr. Burns was a distinguished specialist of\nnational reputation.\nMiller's father, Adam Miller, had been a thrifty colored man, the son of\na slave, who, in the olden time, had bought himself with money which he\nhad earned and saved, over and above what he had paid his master for his\ntime. Adam Miller had inherited his father's thrift, as well as his\ntrade, which was that of a stevedore, or contractor for the loading and\nunloading of vessels at the port of Wellington. In the flush turpentine\ndays following a few years after the civil war, he had made money. His\nsavings, shrewdly invested, had by constant accessions become a\ncompetence. He had brought up his eldest son to the trade; the other he\nhad given a professional education, in the proud hope that his children\nor his grandchildren might be gentlemen in the town where their\nancestors had once been slaves.\nUpon his father's death, shortly after Dr. Miller's return from Europe,\nand a year or two before the date at which this story opens, he had\npromptly spent part of his inheritance in founding a hospital, to which\nwas to be added a training school for nurses, and in time perhaps a\nmedical college and a school of pharmacy. He had been strongly tempted\nto leave the South, and seek a home for his family and a career for\nhimself in the freer North, where race antagonism was less keen, or at\nleast less oppressive, or in Europe, where he had never found his color\nwork to his disadvantage. But his people had needed him, and he had\nwished to help them, and had sought by means of this institution to\ncontribute to their uplifting. As he now informed Dr. Burns, he was\nreturning from New York, where he had been in order to purchase\nequipment for his new hospital, which would soon be ready for the\nreception of patients.\n\"How much I can accomplish I do not know,\" said Miller, \"but I'll do\nwhat I can. There are eight or nine million of us, and it will take a\ngreat deal of learning of all kinds to leaven that lump.\"\n\"It is a great problem, Miller, the future of your race,\" returned the\nother, \"a tremendously interesting problem. It is a serial story which\nwe are all reading, and which grows in vital interest with each\nsuccessive installment. It is not only your problem, but ours. Your race\nmust come up or drag ours down.\"\n\"We shall come up,\" declared Miller; \"slowly and painfully, perhaps, but\nwe shall win our way. If our race had made as much progress everywhere\nas they have made in Wellington, the problem would be well on the way\ntoward solution.\"\n\"Wellington?\" exclaimed Dr. Burns. \"That's where I'm going. A Dr. Price,\nof Wellington, has sent for me to perform an operation on a child's\nthroat. Do you know Dr. Price?\"\n\"Quite well,\" replied Miller, \"he is a friend of mine.\"\n\"So much the better. I shall want you to assist me. I read in the\nMedical Gazette, the other day, an account of a very interesting\noperation of yours. I felt proud to number you among my pupils. It was a\nremarkable case--a rare case. I must certainly have you with me in this\none.\"\n\"I shall be delighted, sir,\" returned Miller, \"if it is agreeable to all\nconcerned.\"\nSeveral hours were passed in pleasant conversation while the train sped\nrapidly southward. They were already far down in Virginia, and had\nstopped at a station beyond Richmond, when the conductor entered the",

      "text": "When the train conductor made his round after leaving the station, he\npaused at the seat occupied by the two doctors, glanced interrogatively\nat Miller, and then spoke to Dr. Burns, who sat in the end of the seat\nnearest the aisle.\n\"This man is with you?\" he asked, indicating Miller with a slight side\nmovement of his head, and a keen glance in his direction.\n\"Certainly,\" replied Dr. Burns curtly, and with some surprise. \"Don't\nyou see that he is?\"\nThe conductor passed on. Miller paid no apparent attention to this\nlittle interlude, though no syllable had escaped him. He resumed the\nconversation where it had been broken off, but nevertheless followed\nwith his eyes the conductor, who stopped at a seat near the forward end\nof the car, and engaged in conversation with a man whom Miller had not\nhitherto noticed.\nAs this passenger turned his head and looked back toward Miller, the\nlatter saw a broad-shouldered, burly white man, and recognized in his\nsquare-cut jaw, his coarse, firm mouth, and the single gray eye with\nwhich he swept Miller for an instant with a scornful glance, a\nwell-known character of Wellington, with whom the reader has already\nmade acquaintance in these pages. Captain McBane wore a frock coat and a\nslouch hat; several buttons of his vest were unbuttoned, and his\nsolitaire diamond blazed in his soiled shirt-front like the headlight of\na locomotive.\nThe conductor in his turn looked back at Miller, and retraced his steps.\nMiller braced himself for what he feared was coming, though he had\nhoped, on account of his friend's presence, that it might be avoided.\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" said the conductor, addressing Dr. Burns, \"but did I\nunderstand you to say that this man was your servant?\"\n\"No, indeed!\" replied Dr. Burns indignantly. \"The gentleman is not my\nservant, nor anybody's servant, but is my friend. But, by the way, since\nwe are on the subject, may I ask what affair it is of yours?\"\n\"It's very much my affair,\" returned the conductor, somewhat nettled at\nthis questioning of his authority. \"I'm sorry to part _friends_, but the\nlaw of Virginia does not permit colored passengers to ride in the white\ncars. You'll have to go forward to the next coach,\" he added, addressing\nMiller this time.\n\"I have paid my fare on the sleeping-car, where the separate-car law\ndoes not apply,\" remonstrated Miller.\n\"I can't help that. You can doubtless get your money back from the\nsleeping-car company. But this is a day coach, and is distinctly marked\n'White,' as you must have seen before you sat down here. The sign is put\nthere for that purpose.\"\nHe indicated a large card neatly framed and hung at the end of the car,\ncontaining the legend, \"White,\" in letters about a foot long, painted in\nwhite upon a dark background, typical, one might suppose, of the\ndistinction thereby indicated.\n\"You shall not stir a step, Miller,\" exclaimed Dr. Burns wrathfully.\n\"This is an outrage upon a citizen of a free country. You shall stay\nright here.\"\n\"I'm sorry to discommode you,\" returned the conductor, \"but there's no\nuse kicking. It's the law of Virginia, and I am bound by it as well as\nyou. I have already come near losing my place because of not enforcing\nit, and I can take no more such chances, since I have a family to\nsupport.\"\n\"And my friend has his rights to maintain,\" returned Dr. Burns with\ndetermination. \"There is a vital principle at stake in the matter.\"\n\"Really, sir,\" argued the conductor, who was a man of peace and not fond\nof controversy, \"there's no use talking--he absolutely cannot ride in\nthis car.\"\n\"How can you prevent it?\" asked Dr. Burns, lapsing into the\nargumentative stage.\n\"The law gives me the right to remove him by force. I can call on the\ntrain crew to assist me, or on the other passengers. If I should choose\nto put him off the train entirely, in the middle of a swamp, he would\nhave no redress--the law so provides. If I did not wish to use force, I\ncould simply switch this car off at the next siding, transfer the white\npassengers to another, and leave you and your friend in possession until\nyou were arrested and fined or imprisoned.\"\n\"What he says is absolutely true, doctor,\" interposed Miller at this\npoint. \"It is the law, and we are powerless to resist it. If we made any\ntrouble, it would merely delay your journey and imperil a life at the\nother end. I'll go into the other car.\"\n\"You shall not go alone,\" said Dr. Burns stoutly, rising in his turn. \"A\nplace that is too good for you is not good enough for me. I will sit\nwherever you do.\"\n\"I'm sorry again,\" said the conductor, who had quite recovered his\nequanimity, and calmly conscious of his power, could scarcely restrain\nan amused smile; \"I dislike to interfere, but white passengers are not\npermitted to ride in the colored car.\"\n\"This is an outrage,\" declared Dr. Burns, \"a d----d outrage! You are\ncurtailing the rights, not only of colored people, but of white men as\nwell. I shall sit where I please!\"\n\"I warn you, sir,\" rejoined the conductor, hardening again, \"that the\nlaw will be enforced. The beauty of the system lies in its strict\nimpartiality--it applies to both races alike.\"\n\"And is equally infamous in both cases,\" declared Dr. Burns. \"I shall\nimmediately take steps\"--\n\"Never mind, doctor,\" interrupted Miller, soothingly, \"it's only for a\nlittle while. I'll reach my destination just as surely in the other car,\nand we can't help it, anyway. I'll see you again at Wellington.\"\nDr. Burns, finding resistance futile, at length acquiesced and made way\nfor Miller to pass him.",

      "text": "The colored doctor took up his valise and crossed the platform to the\ncar ahead. It was an old car, with faded upholstery, from which the\nstuffing projected here and there through torn places. Apparently the\nfloor had not been swept for several days. The dust lay thick upon the\nwindow sills, and the water-cooler, from which he essayed to get a\ndrink, was filled with stale water which had made no recent acquaintance\nwith ice. There was no other passenger in the car, and Miller occupied\nhimself in making a rough calculation of what it would cost the Southern\nrailroads to haul a whole car for every colored passenger. It was\nexpensive, to say the least; it would be cheaper, and quite as\nconsiderate of their feelings, to make the negroes walk.\nThe car was conspicuously labeled at either end with large cards,\nsimilar to those in the other car, except that they bore the word\n\"Colored\" in black letters upon a white background. The author of this\npiece of legislation had contrived, with an ingenuity worthy of a better\ncause, that not merely should the passengers be separated by the color\nline, but that the reason for this division should be kept constantly in\nmind. Lest a white man should forget that he was white,--not a very\nlikely contingency,--these cards would keep him constantly admonished of\nthe fact; should a colored person endeavor, for a moment, to lose sight\nof his disability, these staring signs would remind him continually that\nbetween him and the rest of mankind not of his own color, there was by\nlaw a great gulf fixed.\nHaving composed himself, Miller had opened a newspaper, and was deep in\nan editorial which set forth in glowing language the inestimable\nadvantages which would follow to certain recently acquired islands by\nthe introduction of American liberty, when the rear door of the car\nopened to give entrance to Captain George McBane, who took a seat near\nthe door and lit a cigar. Miller knew him quite well by sight and by\nreputation, and detested him as heartily. He represented the aggressive,\noffensive element among the white people of the New South, who made it\nhard for a negro to maintain his self-respect or to enjoy even the\nrights conceded to colored men by Southern laws. McBane had undoubtedly\nidentified him to the conductor in the other car. Miller had no desire\nto thrust himself upon the society of white people, which, indeed, to\none who had traveled so much and so far, was no novelty; but he very\nnaturally resented being at this late day--the law had been in operation\nonly a few months--branded and tagged and set apart from the rest of\nmankind upon the public highways, like an unclean thing. Nevertheless,\nhe preferred even this to the exclusive society of Captain George\nMcBane.\n\"Porter,\" he demanded of the colored train attach\u00e9 who passed through\nthe car a moment later, \"is this a smoking car for white men?\"\n\"No, suh,\" replied the porter, \"but they comes in here sometimes, when\nthey ain' no cullud ladies on the kyar.\"\n\"Well, I have paid first-class fare, and I object to that man's smoking\nin here. You tell him to go out.\"\n\"I'll tell the conductor, suh,\" returned the porter in a low tone. \"I\n'd jus' as soon talk ter the devil as ter that man.\"\nThe white man had spread himself over two seats, and was smoking\nvigorously, from time to time spitting carelessly in the aisle, when the\nconductor entered the compartment.\n\"Captain,\" said Miller, \"this car is plainly marked 'Colored.' I have\npaid first-class fare, and I object to riding in a smoking car.\"\n\"All right,\" returned the conductor, frowning irritably. \"I'll speak to\nhim.\"\nHe walked over to the white passenger, with whom he was evidently\nacquainted, since he addressed him by name.\n\"Captain McBane,\" he said, \"it's against the law for you to ride in the\nnigger car.\"\n\"Who are you talkin' to?\" returned the other. \"I'll ride where I damn\nplease.\"\n\"Yes, sir, but the colored passenger objects. I'm afraid I'll have to\nask you to go into the smoking-car.\"\n\"The hell you say!\" rejoined McBane. \"I'll leave this car when I get\ngood and ready, and that won't be till I've finished this cigar. See?\"\nHe was as good as his word. The conductor escaped from the car before\nMiller had time for further expostulation. Finally McBane, having thrown\nthe stump of his cigar into the aisle and added to the floor a finishing\ntouch in the way of expectoration, rose and went back into the white\ncar.",

Moved\neither by extreme thirst or by the fear that his time might be too short\nto permit him to draw a bucket of water, he threw himself down by the\ntrough, drank long and deep, and plunging his head into the water, shook\nhimself like a wet dog, and crept furtively back to his dangerous perch.\nMiller, who had seen this man from the car window, had noticed a very\nsingular thing. As the dusty tramp passed the rear coach, he cast toward\nit a glance of intense ferocity. Up to that moment the man's face, which\nMiller had recognized under its grimy coating, had been that of an\nordinarily good-natured, somewhat reckless, pleasure-loving negro, at\npresent rather the worse for wear. The change that now came over it\nsuggested a concentrated hatred almost uncanny in its murderousness.\nWith awakened curiosity Miller followed the direction of the negro's\nglance, and saw that it rested upon a window where Captain McBane sat\nlooking out. When Miller looked back, the negro had disappeared.\nAt the next station a Chinaman, of the ordinary laundry type, boarded\nthe train, and took his seat in the white car without objection. At\nanother point a colored nurse found a place with her mistress.\n\"White people,\" said Miller to himself, who had seen these passengers\nfrom the window, \"do not object to the negro as a servant. As the\ntraditional negro,--the servant,--he is welcomed; as an equal, he is\nrepudiated.\"\nMiller was something of a philosopher. He had long ago had the\nconclusion forced upon him that an educated man of his race, in order to\nlive comfortably in the United States, must be either a philosopher or\na fool; and since he wished to be happy, and was not exactly a fool, he\nhad cultivated philosophy. By and by he saw a white man, with a dog,\nenter the rear coach. Miller wondered whether the dog would be allowed\nto ride with his master, and if not, what disposition would be made of\nhim. He was a handsome dog, and Miller, who was fond of animals, would\nnot have objected to the company of a dog, as a dog. He was nevertheless\nconscious of a queer sensation when he saw the porter take the dog by\nthe collar and start in his own direction, and felt consciously relieved\nwhen the canine passenger was taken on past him into the baggage-car\nahead. Miller's hand was hanging over the arm of his seat, and the dog,\nan intelligent shepherd, licked it as he passed. Miller was not entirely\nsure that he would not have liked the porter to leave the dog there; he\nwas a friendly dog, and seemed inclined to be sociable.\nToward evening the train drew up at a station where quite a party of\nfarm laborers, fresh from their daily toil, swarmed out from the\nconspicuously labeled colored waiting-room, and into the car with\nMiller. They were a jolly, good-natured crowd, and, free from the\nembarrassing presence of white people, proceeded to enjoy themselves\nafter their own fashion. Here an amorous fellow sat with his arm around\na buxom girl's waist. A musically inclined individual--his talents did\nnot go far beyond inclination--produced a mouth-organ and struck up a\ntune, to which a limber-legged boy danced in the aisle. They were noisy,\nloquacious, happy, dirty, and malodorous. For a while Miller was amused\nand pleased. They were his people, and he felt a certain expansive\nwarmth toward them in spite of their obvious shortcomings. By and by,\nhowever, the air became too close, and he went out upon the platform.\nFor the sake of the democratic ideal, which meant so much to his race,\nhe might have endured the affliction. He could easily imagine that\npeople of refinement, with the power in their hands, might be tempted to\nstrain the democratic ideal in order to avoid such contact; but\npersonally, and apart from the mere matter of racial sympathy, these\npeople were just as offensive to him as to the whites in the other end\nof the train. Surely, if a classification of passengers on trains was at\nall desirable, it might be made upon some more logical and considerate\nbasis than a mere arbitrary, tactless, and, by the very nature of\nthings, brutal drawing of a color line. It was a veritable bed of\nProcrustes, this standard which the whites had set for the negroes.\nThose who grew above it must have their heads cut off, figuratively\nspeaking,--must be forced back to the level assigned to their race;\nthose who fell beneath the standard set had their necks stretched,\nliterally enough, as the ghastly record in the daily papers gave\nconclusive evidence.\nMiller breathed more freely when the lively crowd got off at the next\nstation, after a short ride. Moreover, he had a light heart, a\nconscience void of offense, and was only thirty years old. His\nphilosophy had become somewhat jaded on this journey, but he pulled it\ntogether for a final effort. Was it not, after all, a wise provision of\nnature that had given to a race, destined to a long servitude and a slow\nemergence therefrom, a cheerfulness of spirit which enabled them to\ncatch pleasure on the wing, and endure with equanimity the ills that\nseemed inevitable? The ability to live and thrive under adverse\ncircumstances is the surest guaranty of the future. The race which at\nthe last shall inherit the earth--the residuary legatee of\ncivilization--will be the race which remains longest upon it. The negro\nwas here before the Anglo-Saxon was evolved, and his thick lips and\nheavy-lidded eyes looked out from the inscrutable face of the Sphinx\nacross the sands of Egypt while yet the ancestors of those who now\noppress him were living in caves, practicing human sacrifice, and\npainting themselves with woad--and the negro is here yet.\n\"'Blessed are the meek,'\" quoted Miller at the end of these consoling\nreflections, \"'for they shall inherit the earth.' If this be true, the\nnegro may yet come into his estate, for meekness seems to be set apart\nas his portion.\"",

      "text": "Dr. Price was not entirely at ease in his mind as the two doctors drove\nrapidly from the hotel to Major Carteret's. Himself a liberal man, from\nhis point of view, he saw no reason why a colored doctor might not\noperate upon a white male child,--there are fine distinctions in the\napplication of the color line,--but several other physicians had been\ninvited, some of whom were men of old-fashioned notions, who might not\nrelish such an innovation.\nThis, however, was but a small difficulty compared with what might be\nfeared from Major Carteret himself. For he knew Carteret's unrelenting\nhostility to anything that savored of recognition of the negro as the\nequal of white men. It was traditional in Wellington that no colored\nperson had ever entered the front door of the Carteret residence, and\nthat the luckless individual who once presented himself there upon\nalleged business and resented being ordered to the back door had been\nunceremoniously thrown over the piazza railing into a rather thorny\nclump of rosebushes below. If Miller were going as a servant, to hold a\nbasin or a sponge, there would be no difficulty; but as a surgeon--well,\nhe wouldn't borrow trouble. Under the circumstances the major might\nyield a point.\nBut as they neared the house the major's unyielding disposition loomed\nup formidably. Perhaps if the matter were properly presented to Dr.\nBurns, he might consent to withdraw the invitation. It was not yet too,\nlate to send Miller a note.\n\"By the way, Dr. Burns,\" he said, \"I'm very friendly to Dr. Miller, and\nshould personally like to have him with us to-night. But--I ought to\nhave told you this before, but I couldn't very well do so, on such\nshort notice, in Miller's presence--we are a conservative people, and\nour local customs are not very flexible. We jog along in much the same\nold way our fathers did. I'm not at all sure that Major Carteret or the\nother gentlemen would consent to the presence of a negro doctor.\"\n\"I think you misjudge your own people,\" returned Dr. Burns, \"they are\nbroader than you think. We have our prejudices against the negro at the\nNorth, but we do not let them stand in the way of anything that _we_\nwant. At any rate, it is too late now, and I will accept the\nresponsibility. If the question is raised, I will attend to it. When I\nam performing an operation I must be _aut Caesar, aut nullus_.\"\nDr. Price was not reassured, but he had done his duty and felt the\nreward of virtue. If there should be trouble, he would not be\nresponsible. Moreover, there was a large fee at stake, and Dr. Burns was\nnot likely to prove too obdurate.",

There are ten minutes yet.\"\nMajor Carteret looked up with a sudden frown.\n\"May I ask to whom you refer?\" he inquired, in an ominous tone.\nThe other gentlemen showed signs of interest, not to say emotion. Dr.\nPrice smiled quizzically.\n\"Dr. Miller, of your city. He was one of my favorite pupils. He is also\na graduate of the Vienna hospitals, and a surgeon of unusual skill. I\nhave asked him to assist in the operation.\"\nEvery eye was turned toward Carteret, whose crimsoned face had set in a\nlook of grim determination.\n\"The person to whom you refer is a negro, I believe?\" he said.\n\"He is a colored man, certainly,\" returned Dr. Burns, \"though one would\nnever think of his color after knowing him well.\"\n\"I do not know, sir,\" returned Carteret, with an effort at self-control,\n\"what the customs of Philadelphia or Vienna may be; but in the South we\ndo not call negro doctors to attend white patients. I could not permit a\nnegro to enter my house upon such an errand.\"\n\"I am here, sir,\" replied Dr. Burns with spirit, \"to perform a certain\noperation. Since I assume the responsibility, the case must be under my\nentire control. Otherwise I cannot operate.\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" interposed Dr. Price, smoothly, \"I beg of you both--this is\na matter for calm discussion, and any asperity is to be deplored. The\nlife at stake here should not be imperiled by any consideration of minor\nimportance.\"\n\"Your humanity does you credit, sir,\" retorted Dr. Burns. \"But other\nmatters, too, are important. I have invited this gentleman here. My\nprofessional honor is involved, and I merely invoke my rights to\nmaintain it. It is a matter of principle, which ought not to give way to\na mere prejudice.\"\n\"That also states the case for Major Carteret,\" rejoined Dr. Price,\nsuavely. \"He has certain principles,--call them prejudices, if you\nlike,--certain inflexible rules of conduct by which he regulates his\nlife. One of these, which he shares with us all in some degree, forbids\nthe recognition of the negro as a social equal.\"\n\"I do not know what Miller's social value may be,\" replied Dr. Burns,\nstoutly, \"or whether you gain or lose by your attitude toward him. I\nhave invited him here in a strictly professional capacity, with which\nhis color is not at all concerned.\"\n\"Dr. Burns does not quite appreciate Major Carteret's point of view,\"\nsaid Dr. Price. \"This is not with him an unimportant matter, or a mere\nquestion of prejudice, or even of personal taste. It is a sacred\nprinciple, lying at the very root of our social order, involving the\npurity and prestige of our race. You Northern gentlemen do not quite\nappreciate our situation; if you lived here a year or two you would act\nas we do. Of course,\" he added, diplomatically, \"if there were no\nalternative--if Dr. Burns were willing to put Dr. Miller's presence on\nthe ground of imperative necessity\"--\n\"I do nothing of the kind, sir,\" retorted Dr. Burns with some heat. \"I\nhave not come all the way from Philadelphia to undertake an operation\nwhich I cannot perform without the aid of some particular physician. I\nmerely stand upon my professional rights.\"\nCarteret was deeply agitated. The operation must not be deferred; his\nchild's life might be endangered by delay. If the negro's presence were\nindispensable he would even submit to it, though in order to avoid so\npainful a necessity, he would rather humble himself to the Northern\ndoctor. The latter course involved merely a personal sacrifice--the\nformer a vital principle. Perhaps there was another way of escape.\nMiller's presence could not but be distasteful to Mrs. Carteret for\nother reasons. Miller's wife was the living evidence of a painful\nepisode in Mrs. Carteret's family, which the doctor's presence would\ninevitably recall. Once before, Mrs. Carteret's life had been endangered\nby encountering, at a time of great nervous strain, this ill-born\nsister and her child. She was even now upon the verge of collapse at the\nprospect of her child's suffering, and should be protected from the\nintrusion of any idea which might add to her distress.\n\"Dr. Burns,\" he said, with the suave courtesy which was part of his\ninheritance, \"I beg your pardon for my heat, and throw myself upon your\nmagnanimity, as between white men\"--\n\"I am a gentleman, sir, before I am a white man,\" interposed Dr. Burns,\nslightly mollified, however, by Carteret's change of manner.\n\"The terms should be synonymous,\" Carteret could not refrain from\nsaying. \"As between white men, and gentlemen, I say to you, frankly,\nthat there are vital, personal reasons, apart from Dr. Miller's color,\nwhy his presence in this house would be distasteful. With this\nstatement, sir, I throw myself upon your mercy. My child's life is worth\nmore to me than any earthly thing, and I must be governed by your\ndecision.\"\nDr. Burns was plainly wavering. The clock moved with provoking slowness.\nMiller would be there in five minutes.\n\"May I speak with you privately a moment, doctor?\" asked Dr. Price.\nThey withdrew from the room and were engaged in conversation for a few\nmoments. Dr. Burns finally yielded.\n\"I shall nevertheless feel humiliated when I meet Miller again,\" he\nsaid, \"but of course if there is a personal question involved, that\nalters the situation. Had it been merely a matter of color, I should\nhave maintained my position. As things stand, I wash my hands of the",

We Southern people understand the negroes\nbetter than you do, sir. Why should we not? They have been constantly\nunder our interested observation for several hundred years. You feel\nthis vastly more than Miller will. He knows the feeling of the white\npeople, and is accustomed to it. He wishes to live and do business here,\nand is quite too shrewd to antagonize his neighbors or come where he is\nnot wanted. He is in fact too much of a gentleman to do so.\"\n\"I shall leave the explanation to you entirely,\" rejoined Dr. Burns, as\nthey re\u00ebntered the other room.\nCarteret led the way to the nursery, where the operation was to take\nplace. Dr. Price lingered for a moment. Miller was not likely to be\nbehind the hour, if he came at all, and it would be well to head him off\nbefore the operation began.\nScarcely had the rest left the room when the doorbell sounded, and a\nservant announced Dr. Miller.\nDr. Price stepped into the hall and met Miller face to face.\nHe had meant to state the situation to Miller frankly, but now that the\nmoment had come he wavered. He was a fine physician, but he shrank from\nstrenuous responsibilities. It had been easy to theorize about the\nnegro; it was more difficult to look this man in the eyes--whom at this\nmoment he felt to be as essentially a gentleman as himself--and tell him\nthe humiliating truth.\nAs a physician his method was to ease pain--he would rather take the\nrisk of losing a patient from the use of an anaesthetic than from the\nshock of an operation. He liked Miller, wished him well, and would not\nwittingly wound his feelings. He really thought him too much of a\ngentleman for the town, in view of the restrictions with which he must\ninevitably be hampered. There was something melancholy, to a cultivated\nmind, about a sensitive, educated man who happened to be off color. Such\na person was a sort of social misfit, an odd quantity, educated out of\nhis own class, with no possible hope of entrance into that above it. He\nfelt quite sure that if he had been in Miller's place, he would never\nhave settled in the South--he would have moved to Europe, or to the West\nIndies, or some Central or South American state where questions of color\nwere not regarded as vitally important.\nDr. Price did not like to lie, even to a negro. To a man of his own\ncaste, his word was his bond. If it were painful to lie, it would be\nhumiliating to be found out. The principle of _noblesse oblige_ was also\ninvolved in the matter. His claim of superiority to the colored doctor\nrested fundamentally upon the fact that he was white and Miller was not;\nand yet this superiority, for which he could claim no credit, since he\nhad not made himself, was the very breath of his nostrils,--he would not\nhave changed places with the other for wealth untold; and as a\ngentleman, he would not care to have another gentleman, even a colored\nman, catch him in a lie. Of this, however, there was scarcely any\ndanger. A word to the other surgeons would insure their corroboration of\nwhatever he might tell Miller. No one of them would willingly wound Dr.\nMiller or embarrass Dr. Price; indeed, they need not know that Miller\nhad come in time for the operation.\n\"I'm sorry, Miller,\" he said with apparent regret, \"but we were here\nahead of time, and the case took a turn which would admit of no delay,\nso the gentlemen went in. Dr. Burns is with the patient now, and asked\nme to explain why we did not wait for you.\"\n\"I'm sorry too,\" returned Miller, regretfully, but nothing doubting. He\nwas well aware that in such cases danger might attend upon delay. He had\nlost his chance, through no fault of his own or of any one else.\n\"I hope that all is well?\" he said, hesitatingly, not sure whether he\nwould be asked to remain.\n\"All is well, so far.

He was wounded, too, and wanted sympathy, of which Janet was an\nexhaustless fountain. So he told her what had happened. She comforted\nhim after the manner of a loving woman, and felt righteously indignant\ntoward her sister's husband, who had thus been instrumental in the\nhumiliation of her own. Her anger did not embrace her sister, and yet\nshe felt obscurely that their unacknowledged relationship had been the\nmalignant force which had given her husband pain, and defeated his\nhonorable ambition. When Dr. Price entered the nursery, Dr. Burns was\nleaning attentively over the operating table. The implements needed for\nthe operation were all in readiness--the knives, the basin, the sponge,\nthe materials for dressing the wound--all the ghastly paraphernalia of\nvivisection.\nMrs. Carteret had been banished to another room, where Clara vainly\nattempted to soothe her. Old Mammy Jane, still burdened by her fears,\nfervently prayed the good Lord to spare the life of the sweet little\ngrandson of her dear old mistress.\nDr. Burns had placed his ear to the child's chest, which had been bared\nfor the incision. Dr. Price stood ready to administer the anaesthetic.\nLittle Dodie looked up with a faint expression of wonder, as if dimly\nconscious of some unusual event. The major shivered at the thought of\nwhat the child must undergo.\n\"There's a change in his breathing,\" said Dr. Burns, lifting his head.\n\"The whistling noise is less pronounced, and he breathes easier. The\nobstruction seems to have shifted.\"\nApplying his ear again to the child's throat, he listened for a moment\nintently, and then picking the baby up from the table, gave it a couple\nof sharp claps between the shoulders. Simultaneously a small object shot\nout from the child's mouth, struck Dr. Price in the neighborhood of his\nwaistband, and then rattled lightly against the floor. Whereupon the\nbaby, as though conscious of his narrow escape, smiled and gurgled, and\nreaching upward clutched the doctor's whiskers with his little hand,\nwhich, according to old Jane, had a stronger grip than any other\ninfant's in Wellington.",

Carteret had set out, in\nthe columns of the Morning Chronicle, all the reasons why this movement,\ninaugurated by the three men who had met, six months before, at the\noffice of the Chronicle, should be supported by the white public. Negro\ncitizenship was a grotesque farce--Sambo and Dinah raised from the\nkitchen to the cabinet were a spectacle to make the gods laugh. The laws\nby which it had been sought to put the negroes on a level with the\nwhites must be swept away in theory, as they had failed in fact. If it\nwere impossible, without a further education of public opinion, to\nsecure the repeal of the fifteenth amendment, it was at least the solemn\nduty of the state to endeavor, through its own constitution, to escape\nfrom the domination of a weak and incompetent electorate and confine the\nnegro to that inferior condition for which nature had evidently designed\nhim.\nIn spite of the force and intelligence with which Carteret had expressed\nthese and similar views, they had not met the immediate response\nanticipated. There were thoughtful men, willing to let well enough\nalone, who saw no necessity for such a movement. They believed that\npeace, prosperity, and popular education offered a surer remedy for\nsocial ills than the reopening of issues supposed to have been settled.\nThere were timid men who shrank from civic strife. There were busy men,\nwho had something else to do. There were a few fair men, prepared to\nadmit, privately, that a class constituting half to two thirds of the\npopulation were fairly entitled to some representation in the law-making\nbodies. Perhaps there might have been found, somewhere in the state, a\nsingle white man ready to concede that all men were entitled to equal\nrights before the law.\nThat there were some white men who had learned little and forgotten\nnothing goes without saying, for knowledge and wisdom are not\nimpartially distributed among even the most favored race. There were\nignorant and vicious negroes, and they had a monopoly of neither\nignorance nor crime, for there were prosperous negroes and\npoverty-stricken whites. Until Carteret and his committee began their\nbaleful campaign the people of the state were living in peace and\nharmony. The anti-negro legislation in more southern states, with large\nnegro majorities, had awakened scarcely an echo in this state, with a\npopulation two thirds white. Even the triumph of the Fusion party had\nnot been regarded as a race issue. It remained for Carteret and his\nfriends to discover, with inspiration from whatever supernatural source\nthe discriminating reader may elect, that the darker race, docile by\ninstinct, humble by training, patiently waiting upon its as yet\nuncertain destiny, was an incubus, a corpse chained to the body politic,\nand that the negro vote was a source of danger to the state, no matter\nhow cast or by whom directed.",

It is clear that we must\nreckon on opposition, both at home and abroad. If we are to hope for\nsuccess, we must extend the lines of our campaign. The North, as well as\nour own people, must be convinced that we have right upon our side. We\nare conscious of the purity of our motives, but we should avoid even the\nappearance of evil.\"\nMcBane was tapping the floor impatiently with his foot during this\nharangue.\n\"I don't see the use,\" he interrupted, \"of so much beating about the\nbush. We may as well be honest about this thing. We are going to put the\nniggers down because we want to, and think we can; so why waste our time\nin mere pretense? I'm no hypocrite myself,--if I want a thing I take it,\nprovided I'm strong enough.\"\n\"My dear captain,\" resumed the general, with biting suavity, \"your\nfrankness does you credit,--'an honest man's the noblest work of\nGod,'--but we cannot carry on politics in these degenerate times without\na certain amount of diplomacy. In the good old days when your father was\nalive, and perhaps nowadays in the discipline of convicts, direct and\nsimple methods might be safely resorted to; but this is a modern age,\nand in dealing with so fundamental a right as the suffrage we must\nprofess a decent regard for the opinions of even that misguided portion\nof mankind which may not agree with us. This is the age of crowds, and\nwe must have the crowd with us.\" The captain flushed at the allusion\nto his father's calling, at which he took more offense than at the\nmention of his own. He knew perfectly well that these old aristocrats,\nwhile reaping the profits of slavery, had despised the instruments by\nwhich they were attained--the poor-white overseer only less than the\nblack slave. McBane was rich; he lived in Wellington, but he had never\nbeen invited to the home of either General Belmont or Major Carteret,\nnor asked to join the club of which they were members. His face,\ntherefore, wore a distinct scowl, and his single eye glowed ominously.\nHe would help these fellows carry the state for white supremacy, and\nthen he would have his innings,--he would have more to say than they\ndreamed, as to who should fill the offices under the new deal. Men of no\nbetter birth or breeding than he had represented Southern states in\nCongress since the war. Why should he not run for governor,\nrepresentative, whatever he chose? He had money enough to buy out half a\ndozen of these broken-down aristocrats, and money was all-powerful.\n\"You see, captain,\" the general went on, looking McBane smilingly and\nunflinchingly in the eye, \"we need white immigration--we need Northern\ncapital. 'A good name is better than great riches,' and we must prove\nour cause a righteous one.\"\n\"We must be armed at all points,\" added Carteret, \"and prepared for\ndefense as well as for attack,--we must make our campaign a national\none.\"\n\"For instance,\" resumed the general, \"you, Carteret, represent the\nAssociated Press. Through your hands passes all the news of the state.\nWhat more powerful medium for the propagation of an idea? The man who\nwould govern a nation by writing its songs was a blethering idiot beside\nthe fellow who can edit its news dispatches. The negroes are playing\ninto our hands,--every crime that one of them commits is reported by us.\nWith the latitude they have had in this state they are growing more\nimpudent and self-assertive every day. A yellow demagogue in New York\nmade a speech only a few days ago, in which he deliberately, and in cold\nblood, advised negroes to defend themselves to the death when attacked\nby white people! I remember well the time when it was death for a negro\nto strike a white man.\"\n\"It's death now, if he strikes the right one,\" interjected McBane,\nrestored to better humor by this mention of a congenial subject.\nThe general smiled a fine smile. He had heard the story of how McBane\nhad lost his other eye.\n\"The local negro paper is quite outspoken, too,\" continued the general,\n\"if not impudent. We must keep track of that; it may furnish us some\ngood campaign material.\"\n\"Yes,\" returned Carteret, \"we must see to that. I threw a copy into the\nwaste-basket this morning, without looking at it. Here it is now!\"",

I'll act upon it.\"\nThis political conference was fruitful in results. Acting upon the plans\nthere laid out, McBane traveled extensively through the state, working\nup sentiment in favor of the new movement. He possessed a certain\nforceful eloquence; and white supremacy was so obviously the divine\nintention that he had merely to affirm the doctrine in order to secure\nadherents.\nGeneral Belmont, whose business required him to spend much of the winter\nin Washington and New York, lost no opportunity to get the ear of\nlawmakers, editors, and other leaders of national opinion, and to\nimpress upon them, with persuasive eloquence, the impossibility of\nmaintaining existing conditions, and the tremendous blunder which had\nbeen made in conferring the franchise upon the emancipated race.\nCarteret conducted the press campaign, and held out to the Republicans\nof the North the glittering hope that, with the elimination of the negro\nvote, and a proper deference to Southern feeling, a strong white\nRepublican party might be built up in the New South. How well the bait\ntook is a matter of history,--but the promised result is still in the\nfuture. The disfranchisement of the negro has merely changed the form of\nthe same old problem. The negro had no vote before the rebellion, and\nfew other rights, and yet the negro question was, for a century, the\npivot of American politics. It plunged the nation into a bloody war,\nand it will trouble the American government and the American conscience\nuntil a sustained attempt is made to settle it upon principles of\njustice and equity.\nThe personal ambitions entertained by the leaders of this movement are\nbut slightly involved in this story. McBane's aims have been touched\nupon elsewhere. The general would have accepted the nomination for\ngovernor of the state, with a vision of a senatorship in the future.\nCarteret hoped to vindicate the supremacy of his race, and make the\nstate fit for his son to live in, and, incidentally, he would not refuse\nany office, worthy of his dignity, which a grateful people might thrust\nupon him.\nSo powerful a combination of bigot, self-seeking demagogue, and astute\npolitician was fraught with grave menace to the peace of the state and\nthe liberties of the people,--by which is meant the whole people, and\nnot any one class, sought to be built up at the expense of another.",

He mentioned collaterally the\nunblemished honor of a fine old family, its contemplated alliance with\nhis own, and dwelt upon the sweet simplicity of Clara's character. The\nmajor was a man of feeling and of tact, and could not have put the\nsubject in a way less calculated to wound the _amour propre_ of a very\nyoung man.\nDelamere had turned red with anger while the major was speaking. He was\nimpulsive, and an effort was required to keep back the retort that\nsprang once or twice to his lips; but his conscience was not clear, and\nhe could not afford hard words with Clara's guardian and his\ngrandfather's friend. Clara was rich, and the most beautiful girl in\ntown; they were engaged; he loved her as well as he could love anything\nof which he seemed sure; and he did not mean that any one else should\nhave her.

      "text": "Delamere's suspicions with regard to Ellis's feelings were not, as we\nhave seen, entirely without foundation. Indeed, he had underestimated\nthe strength of this rivalry and its chances of success. Ellis had been\nwatching Delamere for a year. There had been nothing surreptitious about\nit, but his interest in Clara had led him to note things about his\nfavored rival which might have escaped the attention of others less\nconcerned.\nEllis was an excellent judge of character, and had formed a very decided\nopinion of Tom Delamere. To Ellis, unbiased by ancestral traditions,\nbiased perhaps by jealousy, Tom Delamere was a type of the degenerate\naristocrat. If, as he had often heard, it took three or four generations\nto make a gentleman, and as many more to complete the curve and return\nto the base from which it started, Tom Delamere belonged somewhere on\nthe downward slant, with large possibilities of further decline. Old\nMr. Delamere, who might be taken as the apex of an ideal aristocratic\ndevelopment, had been distinguished, during his active life, as Ellis\nhad learned, for courage and strength of will, courtliness of bearing,\ndeference to his superiors, of whom there had been few, courtesy to his\nequals, kindness and consideration for those less highly favored, and\nabove all, a scrupulous sense of honor; his grandson Tom was merely the\nshadow without the substance, the empty husk without the grain. Of grace\nhe had plenty. In manners he could be perfect, when he so chose. Courage\nand strength he had none. Ellis had seen this fellow, who boasted of his\ndescent from a line of cavaliers, turn pale with fright and spring from\na buggy to which was harnessed a fractious horse, which a negro\nstable-boy drove fearlessly. A valiant carpet-knight, skilled in all\nparlor exercises, great at whist or euchre, a dream of a dancer,\nunexcelled in Cakewalk or \"coon\" impersonations, for which he was in\nlarge social demand, Ellis had seen him kick an inoffensive negro out of\nhis path and treat a poor-white man with scant courtesy. He suspected\nDelamere of cheating at cards, and knew that others entertained the same\nsuspicion. For while regular in his own habits,--his poverty would not\nhave permitted him any considerable extravagance,--Ellis's position as a\nnewspaper man kept him in touch with what was going on about town. He\nwas a member, proposed by Carteret, of the Clarendon Club, where cards\nwere indulged in within reasonable limits, and a certain set were known\nto bet dollars in terms of dimes.\nDelamere was careless, too, about money matters. He had a habit of\nborrowing, right and left, small sums which might be conveniently\nforgotten by the borrower, and for which the lender would dislike to\nask. Ellis had a strain of thrift, derived from a Scotch ancestry, and a\ntenacious memory for financial details. Indeed, he had never had so much\nmoney that he could lose track of it. He never saw Delamere without\nbeing distinctly conscious that Delamere owed him four dollars, which he\nhad lent at a time when he could ill afford to spare it. It was a\nprerogative of aristocracy, Ellis reflected, to live upon others, and\nthe last privilege which aristocracy in decay would willingly\nrelinquish. Neither did the aristocratic memory seem able to retain the\nsordid details of a small pecuniary transaction.\nNo doubt the knowledge that Delamere was the favored lover of Miss\nPemberton lent a touch of bitterness to Ellis's reflections upon his\nrival. Ellis had no grievance against the \"aristocracy\" of Wellington.\nThe \"best people\" had received him cordially, though his father had not\nbeen of their caste; but Ellis hated a hypocrite, and despised a coward,\nand he felt sure that Delamere was both. Otherwise he would have\nstruggled against his love for Clara Pemberton. His passion for her had\ngrown with his appreciation of Delamere's unworthiness. As a friend of\nthe family, he knew the nature and terms of the engagement, and that if\nthe marriage took place at all, it would not be for at least a year.",

      "text": "Mrs. Ochiltree drove immediately to her niece's, where she found Mrs.\nCarteret and Clara at home. Clara was very fond of the baby, and was\nholding him in her arms. He was a fine baby, and bade fair to realize\nthe bright hopes built upon him.\n\"You hold a baby very naturally, Clara,\" chuckled the old lady. \"I\nsuppose you are in training. But you ought to talk to Tom. I have just\nlearned from Mr. Ellis that Tom is carried home drunk two or three times\na week, and that he is gambling in the most reckless manner imaginable.\"\nClara's eyes flashed indignantly. Ere she could speak, Mrs. Carteret\nexclaimed:--\n\"Why, Aunt Polly! did Mr. Ellis say that?\"\n\"I got it from Dinah,\" she replied, \"who heard it from her husband, who\nlearned it from a waiter at the club. And\"--\n\"Pshaw!\" said Mrs. Carteret, \"mere servants' gossip.\"\n\"No, it isn't, Olivia. I met Mr. Ellis on the street, and asked him\npoint blank, and he didn't deny it. He's a member of the club, and\nought to know.\"\n\"Well, Aunt Polly, it can't be true. Tom is here every other night, and\nhow could he carry on so without showing the signs of it? and where\nwould he get the money? You know he has only a moderate allowance.\"\n\"He may win it at cards,--it's better to be born lucky than rich,\"\nreturned Mrs. Ochiltree. \"Then he has expectations, and can get credit.\nThere's no doubt that Tom is going on shamefully.\" Clara's\nindignation had not yet found vent in speech; Olivia had said all that\nwas necessary, but she had been thinking rapidly. Even if all this had\nbeen true, why should Mr. Ellis have said it? Or, if he had not stated\nit directly, he had left the inference to be drawn. It seemed a most\nunfair and ungentlemanly thing. What motive could Ellis have for such an\nact?\nShe was not long in reaching a conclusion which was not flattering to\nEllis. Mr. Ellis came often to the house, and she had enjoyed his\nsociety in a friendly way. That he had found her pleasant company had\nbeen very evident. She had never taken his attentions seriously,\nhowever, or regarded his visits as made especially to her, nor had the\nrest of the family treated them from that point of view. Her engagement\nto Tom Delamere, though not yet formally ratified, was so well\nunderstood by the world of Wellington that Mr. Ellis would, scarcely\nhave presumed to think of her as anything more than a friend.\nThis revelation of her aunt's, however, put a different face upon his\nconduct. Certain looks and sighs and enigmatical remarks of Ellis, to\nwhich she had paid but casual attention and attached no particular\nsignificance, now recurred to her memory with a new meaning. He had now\nevidently tried, in a roundabout way, to besmirch Tom's character and\nundermine him in her regard. While loving Tom, she had liked Ellis well\nenough, as a friend; but he had abused the privileges of friendship, and\nshe would teach him a needed lesson.\nNevertheless, Mrs. Ochiltree's story had given Clara food for thought.\nShe was uneasily conscious, after all, that there might be a grain of\ntruth in what had been said, enough, at least, to justify her in\nwarning Tom to be careful, lest his enemies should distort some amiable\nweakness into a serious crime.\nShe put this view of the case to Tom at their next meeting, assuring\nhim, at the same time, of her unbounded faith and confidence. She did\nnot mention Ellis's name, lest Tom, in righteous indignation, might do\nsomething rash, which he might thereafter regret. If any subtler or more\nobscure motive kept her silent as to Ellis, she was not aware of it; for\nClara's views of life were still in the objective stage, and she had not\nyet fathomed the deepest recesses of her own consciousness.",

Struck by a sudden thought, she drew near the window\nand looked out. Twice within a few weeks her child had been in serious\ndanger, and upon each occasion a member of the Miller family had been\ninvolved, for she had heard of Dr. Miller's presumption in trying to\nforce himself where he must have known he would be unwelcome.\nJanet was just turning her head away as the buggy moved slowly off.\nOlivia felt a violent wave of antipathy sweep over her toward this\nbaseborn sister who had thus thrust herself beneath her eyes. If she had\nnot cast her brazen glance toward the window, she herself would not have\nturned away and lost sight of her child. To this shameless intrusion,\nlinked with Clara's carelessness, had been due the catastrophe, so\nnarrowly averted, which might have darkened her own life forever.

      "text": "One morning shortly after the opening of the hospital, while Dr. Miller\nwas making his early rounds, a new patient walked in with a smile on his\nface and a broken arm hanging limply by his side. Miller recognized in\nhim a black giant by the name of Josh Green, who for many years had\nworked on the docks for Miller's father,--and simultaneously identified\nhim as the dust-begrimed negro who had stolen a ride to Wellington on\nthe trucks of a passenger car.\n\"Well, Josh,\" asked the doctor, as he examined the fracture, \"how did\nyou get this? Been fighting again?\"\n\"No, suh, I don' s'pose you could ha'dly call it a fight. One er dem\ndagoes off'n a Souf American boat gimme some er his jaw, an' I give 'im\na back answer, an' here I is wid a broken arm. He got holt er a\nbelayin'-pin befo' I could hit 'im.\"\n\"What became of the other man?\" demanded Miller suspiciously. He\nperceived, from the indifference with which Josh bore the manipulation\nof the fractured limb, that such an accident need not have interfered\nseriously with the use of the remaining arm, and he knew that Josh had a\nreputation for absolute fearlessness.\n\"Lemme see,\" said Josh reflectively, \"ef I kin 'member w'at _did_ become\ner him! Oh, yes, I 'member now! Dey tuck him ter de Marine Horspittle\nin de amberlance, 'cause his leg wuz broke, an' I reckon somethin' must\n'a' accident'ly hit 'im in de jaw, fer he wuz scatt'rin' teeth all de\nway 'long de street. I didn' wan' ter kill de man, fer he might have\nsomebody dependin' on 'im, an' I knows how dat'd be ter dem. But no man\nkin call me a damn' low-down nigger and keep on enjoyin' good health\nright along.\"\n\"It was considerate of you to spare his life,\" said Miller dryly, \"but\nyou'll hit the wrong man some day. These are bad times for bad negroes.\nYou'll get into a quarrel with a white man, and at the end of it there'll\nbe a lynching, or a funeral. You'd better be peaceable and endure a\nlittle injustice, rather than run the risk of a sudden and violent\ndeath.\"\n\"I expec's ter die a vi'lent death in a quarrel wid a w'ite man,\"\nreplied Josh, in a matter-of-fact tone, \"an' fu'thermo', he's gwine ter\ndie at the same time, er a little befo'. I be'n takin' my own time 'bout\nkillin' 'im; I ain' be'n crowdin' de man, but I'll be ready after a\nw'ile, an' den he kin look out!\"\n\"And I suppose you're merely keeping in practice on these other fellows\nwho come your way. When I get your arm dressed, you'd better leave town\ntill that fellow's boat sails; it may save you the expense of a trial\nand three months in the chain-gang. But this talk about killing a man is\nall nonsense. What has any man in this town done to you, that you should\nthirst for his blood?\"\n\"No, suh, it ain' nonsense,--it's straight, solem' fac'. I'm gwine ter\nkill dat man as sho' as I'm settin' in dis cheer; an' dey ain' nobody\nkin say I ain' got a right ter kill 'im. Does you 'member de Ku-Klux?\"\n\"Yes, but I was a child at the time, and recollect very little about\nthem. It is a page of history which most people are glad to forget.\"\n\"Yas, suh; I was a chile, too, but I wuz right in it, an' so I 'members\nmo' erbout it 'n you does. My mammy an' daddy lived 'bout ten miles f'm\nhere, up de river. One night a crowd er w'ite men come ter ou' house an'\ntuck my daddy out an' shot 'im ter death, an' skeered my mammy so she\nain' be'n herse'f f'm dat day ter dis. I wa'n't mo' 'n ten years ole at\nde time, an' w'en my mammy seed de w'ite men comin', she tol' me ter\nrun. I hid in de bushes an' seen de whole thing, an' it wuz branded on\nmy mem'ry, suh, like a red-hot iron bran's de skin. De w'ite folks had\nmasks on, but one of 'em fell off,--he wuz de boss, he wuz de head man,\nan' tol' de res' w'at ter do,--an' I seen his face. It wuz a easy face\nter 'member; an' I swo' den, 'way down deep in my hea't, little ez I\nwuz, dat some day er 'nother I'd kill dat man. I ain't never had no\ndoubt erbout it; it's jus' w'at I'm livin' fer, an' I know I ain' gwine\nter die till I've done it. Some lives fer one thing an' some fer\nanother, but dat's my job. I ain' be'n in no has'e, fer I'm not ole\nyit, an' dat man is in good health. I'd like ter see a little er de\nworl' befo' I takes chances on leavin' it sudden; an', mo'over,\nsomebody's got ter take keer er de ole 'oman. But her time'll come some\ner dese days, an den _his_ time'll be come--an' prob'ly mine. But I\nain' keerin' 'bout myse'f: w'en I git thoo wid him, it won' make no\ndiff'ence 'bout me.\"\nJosh was evidently in dead earnest. Miller recalled, very vividly, the\nexpression he had seen twice on his patient's face, during the journey\nto Wellington.\nHe had often seen Josh's mother, old Aunt Milly,--\"Silly Milly,\" the\nchildren called her,--wandering aimlessly about the street, muttering to\nherself incoherently. He had felt a certain childish awe at the sight of\none of God's creatures who had lost the light of reason, and he had\nalways vaguely understood that she was the victim of human cruelty,\nthough he had dated it farther back into the past. This was his first\nknowledge of the real facts of the case.\nHe realized, too, for a moment, the continuity of life, how inseparably\nthe present is woven with the past, how certainly the future will be but\nthe outcome of the present. He had supposed this old wound healed. The\nnegroes were not a vindictive people. If, swayed by passion or emotion,\nthey sometimes gave way to gusts of rage, these were of brief duration.\nAbsorbed in the contemplation of their doubtful present and their\nuncertain future, they gave little thought to the past,--it was a dark\nstory, which they would willingly forget. He knew the timeworn\nexplanation that the Ku-Klux movement, in the main, was merely an\nebullition of boyish spirits, begun to amuse young white men by playing\nupon the fears and superstitions of ignorant negroes. Here, however, was\nits tragic side,--the old wound still bleeding, the fruit of one\ntragedy, the seed of another. He could not approve of Josh's application\nof the Mosaic law of revenge, and yet the incident was not without\nsignificance. Here was a negro who could remember an injury, who could\nshape his life to a definite purpose, if not a high or holy one. When\nhis race reached the point where they would resent a wrong, there was\nhope that they might soon attain the stage where they would try, and, if\nneed be, die, to defend a right. This man, too, had a purpose in life,\nand was willing to die that he might accomplish it. Miller was willing\nto give up his life to a cause. Would he be equally willing, he asked\nhimself, to die for it? Miller had no prophetic instinct to tell him how\nsoon he would have the opportunity to answer his own question. But he\ncould not encourage Josh to carry out this dark and revengeful purpose.\nEvery worthy consideration required him to dissuade his patient from\nsuch a desperate course.\n\"You had better put away these murderous fancies, Josh,\" he said\nseriously. \"The Bible says that we should 'forgive our enemies, bless\nthem that curse us, and do good to them that despitefully use us.'\"\n\"Yas, suh, I've l'arnt all dat in Sunday-school, an' I've heared de\npreachers say it time an' time ag'in. But it 'pears ter me dat dis\nfergitfulniss an' fergivniss is mighty one-sided. De w'ite folks don'\nfergive nothin' de niggers does. Dey got up de Ku-Klux, dey said, on\n'count er de kyarpit-baggers. Dey be'n talkin' 'bout de kyarpit-baggers\never sence, an' dey 'pears ter fergot all 'bout de Ku-Klux. But I ain'\nfergot. De niggers is be'n train' ter fergiveniss; an' fer fear dey\nmight fergit how ter fergive, de w'ite folks gives 'em somethin' new\nev'y now an' den, ter practice on. A w'ite man kin do w'at he wants ter\na nigger, but de minute de nigger gits back at 'im, up goes de nigger,\nan' don' come down tell somebody cuts 'im down. If a nigger gits a'\noffice, er de race 'pears ter be prosperin' too much, de w'ite folks up\nan' kills a few, so dat de res' kin keep on fergivin' an' bein' thankful\ndat dey're lef alive. Don' talk ter me 'bout dese w'ite folks,--I knows\n'em, I does! Ef a nigger wants ter git down on his marrow-bones, an' eat\ndirt, an' call 'em 'marster,' _he's_ a good nigger, dere's room fer\n_him_. But I ain' no w'ite folks' nigger, I ain'. I don' call no man\n'marster.' I don' wan' nothin' but w'at I wo'k fer, but I wants all er\ndat. I never moles's no w'ite man, 'less 'n he moles's me fus'. But w'en\nde ole 'oman dies, doctuh, an' I gits a good chance at dat w'ite\nman,--dere ain' no use talkin', suh!--dere's gwine ter be a mix-up, an'\na fune'al, er two fune'als--er may be mo', ef anybody is keerliss enough\nto git in de way.\"\n\"Josh,\" said the doctor, laying a cool hand on the other's brow, \"you\n're feverish, and don't know what you're talking about. I shouldn't\nlet my mind dwell on such things, and you must keep quiet until this arm\nis well, or you may never be able to hit any one with it again.\"\nMiller determined that when Josh got better he would talk to him\nseriously and dissuade him from this dangerous design. He had not asked\nthe name of Josh's enemy, but the look of murderous hate which the\ndust-begrimed tramp of the railway journey had cast at Captain George\nMcBane rendered any such question superfluous. McBane was probably\ndeserving of any evil fate which might befall him; but such a revenge\nwould do no good, would right no wrong; while every such crime,\ncommitted by a colored man, would be imputed to the race, which was\nalready staggering under a load of obloquy because, in the eyes of a\nprejudiced and undiscriminating public, it must answer as a whole for\nthe offenses of each separate individual.

      "text": "Old Mr. Delamere's servant, Sandy Campbell, was in deep trouble.\nA party of Northern visitors had been staying for several days at the\nSt. James Hotel. The gentlemen of the party were concerned in a\nprojected cotton mill, while the ladies were much interested in the\nstudy of social conditions, and especially in the negro problem. As soon\nas their desire for information became known, they were taken\ncourteously under the wing of prominent citizens and their wives, who\ngave them, at elaborate luncheons, the Southern white man's views of the\nnegro, sighing sentimentally over the disappearance of the good old\nnegro of before the war, and gravely deploring the degeneracy of his\ndescendants. They enlarged upon the amount of money the Southern whites\nhad spent for the education of the negro, and shook their heads over the\ninadequate results accruing from this unexampled generosity. It was sad,\nthey said, to witness this spectacle of a dying race, unable to\nwithstand the competition of a superior type. The severe reprisals taken\nby white people for certain crimes committed by negroes were of course\nnot the acts of the best people, who deplored them; but still a certain\ncharity should be extended towards those who in the intense and\nrighteous anger of the moment should take the law into their own hands\nand deal out rough but still substantial justice; for no negro was ever\nlynched without incontestable proof of his guilt. In order to be\nperfectly fair, and give their visitors an opportunity to see both sides\nof the question, they accompanied the Northern visitors to a colored\nchurch where they might hear a colored preacher, who had won a jocular\npopularity throughout the whole country by an oft-repeated sermon\nintended to demonstrate that the earth was flat like a pancake. This\ncelebrated divine could always draw a white audience, except on the days\nwhen his no less distinguished white rival in the field of\nsensationalism preached his equally famous sermon to prove that hell was\nexactly one half mile, linear measure, from the city limits of\nWellington. Whether accidentally or not, the Northern visitors had no\nopportunity to meet or talk alone with any colored person in the city\nexcept the servants at the hotel. When one of the party suggested a\nvisit to the colored mission school, a Southern friend kindly\nvolunteered to accompany them.\nThe visitors were naturally much impressed by what they learned from\ntheir courteous hosts, and felt inclined to sympathize with the Southern\npeople, for the negro is not counted as a Southerner, except to fix the\nbasis of congressional representation. There might of course be things\nto criticise here and there, certain customs for which they did not\nexactly see the necessity, and which seemed in conflict with the highest\nideals of liberty but surely these courteous, soft-spoken ladies and\ngentlemen, entirely familiar with local conditions, who descanted so\nearnestly and at times pathetically upon the grave problems confronting\nthem, must know more about it than people in the distant North, without\ntheir means of information. The negroes who waited on them at the hotel\nseemed happy enough, and the teachers whom they had met at the mission\nschool had been well-dressed, well-mannered, and apparently content with\ntheir position in life. Surely a people who made no complaints could not\nbe very much oppressed.",

      "text": "The cakewalk was a great success. The most brilliant performer was a\nlate arrival, who made his appearance just as the performance was about\nto commence. The newcomer was dressed strikingly, the conspicuous\nfeatures of his attire being a long blue coat with brass buttons and a\npair of plaid trousers. He was older, too, than the other participants,\nwhich made his agility the more remarkable. His partner was a new\nchambermaid, who had just come to town, and whom the head waiter\nintroduced to the newcomer upon his arrival. The cake was awarded to\nthis couple by a unanimous vote. The man presented it to his partner\nwith a grandiloquent flourish, and returned thanks in a speech which\nsent the Northern visitors into spasms of delight at the quaintness of\nthe darky dialect and the darky wit. To cap the climax, the winner\ndanced a buck dance with a skill and agility that brought a shower of\ncomplimentary silver, which he gathered up and passed to the head\nwaiter.\nEllis was off duty for the evening. Not having ventured to put in an\nappearance at Carteret's since his last rebuff, he found himself\nburdened with a superfluity of leisure, from which he essayed to find\nrelief by dropping into the hotel office at about nine o'clock. He was\ninvited up to see the cakewalk, which he rather enjoyed, for there was\nsome graceful dancing and posturing. But the grotesque contortions of\none participant had struck him as somewhat overdone, even for the\ncomical type of negro. He recognized the fellow, after a few minutes'\nscrutiny, as the body-servant of old Mr. Delamere.

There was a vague\nsuggestion of unreality about this performance, too, which Ellis did not\nattempt to analyze, but which recurred vividly to his memory upon a\nsubsequent occasion.\nEllis had never pretended to that intimate knowledge of negro thought\nand character by which some of his acquaintances claimed the ability to\nfathom every motive of a negro's conduct, and predict in advance what\nany one of the darker race would do under a given set of circumstances.\nHe would not have believed that a white man could possess two so widely\nvarying phases of character; but as to negroes, they were as yet a crude\nand undeveloped race, and it was not safe to make predictions concerning\nthem. No one could tell at what moment the thin veneer of civilization\nmight peel off and reveal the underlying savage.\nThe champion cakewalker, much to the surprise of his sable companions,\nwho were about equally swayed by admiration and jealousy, disappeared\nimmediately after the close of the performance. Any one watching him on\nhis way home through the quiet streets to old Mr. Delamere's would have\nseen him now and then shaking with laughter. It had been excellent fun.\nNevertheless, as he neared home, a certain aspect of the affair,\nhitherto unconsidered, occurred to him, and it was in a rather serious\nframe of mind that he cautiously entered the house and sought his own\nroom.",

      "text": "The cakewalk had results which to Sandy were very serious. The following\nweek he was summoned before the disciplinary committee of his church and\ncharged with unchristian conduct, in the following particulars, to wit:\ndancing, and participating in a sinful diversion called a cakewalk,\nwhich was calculated to bring the church into disrepute and make it the\nmockery of sinners.\nSandy protested his innocence vehemently, but in vain. The proof was\noverwhelming. He was positively identified by Sister 'Manda Patterson,\nthe hotel cook, who had watched the whole performance from the hotel\ncorridor for the sole, single, solitary, and only purpose, she averred,\nof seeing how far human wickedness could be carried by a professing\nChristian. The whole thing had been shocking and offensive to her, and\nonly a stern sense of duty had sustained her in looking on, that she\nmight be qualified to bear witness against the offender. She had\nrecognized his face, his clothes, his voice, his walk--there could be no\nshadow of doubt that it was Brother Sandy. This testimony was confirmed\nby one of the deacons, whose son, a waiter at the hotel, had also seen\nSandy at the cakewalk.\nSandy stoutly insisted that he was at home the whole evening; that he\nhad not been near the hotel for three months; that he had never in his\nlife taken part in a cakewalk, and that he did not know how to dance.\nIt was replied that wickedness, like everything else, must have a\nbeginning; that dancing was an art that could be acquired in secret, and\ncame natural to some people. In the face of positive proof, Sandy's\nprotestations were of no avail; he was found guilty, and suspended from\nchurch fellowship until he should have repented and made full\nconfession.\nSturdily refusing to confess a fault of which he claimed to be innocent,\nSandy remained in contumacy, thereby falling somewhat into disrepute\namong the members of his church, the largest in the city. The effect of\na bad reputation being subjective as well as objective, and poor human\nnature arguing that one may as well have the game as the name, Sandy\ninsensibly glided into habits of which the church would not have\napproved, though he took care that they should not interfere with his\nduties to Mr. Delamere. The consolation thus afforded, however, followed\nas it was by remorse of conscience, did not compensate him for the loss\nof standing in the church, which to him was a social club as well as a\nreligious temple. At times, in conversation with young Delamere, he\nwould lament his hard fate.\nTom laughed until he cried at the comical idea which Sandy's plaint\nalways brought up, of half-a-dozen negro preachers sitting in solemn\njudgment upon that cakewalk,--it had certainly been a good\ncakewalk!--and sending poor Sandy to spiritual Coventry.\n\"Cheer up, Sandy, cheer up!\" he would say when Sandy seemed most\ndepressed. \"Go into my room and get yourself a good drink of liquor. The\ndevil's church has a bigger congregation than theirs, and we have the\nconsolation of knowing that when we die, we'll meet all our friends on\nthe other side. Brace up, Sandy, and be a man, or, if you can't be a\nman, be as near a man as you can!\"\nHoping to revive his drooping spirits, Sandy too often accepted the",

This characteristic caused her to be more or less\navoided. Mrs. Ochiltree was aware of this sentiment on the part of her\nacquaintance, and rather exulted in it. She hated fools. Only fools ran\naway from her, and that because they were afraid she would expose their\nfolly. If most people were fools, it was no fault of hers, and she was\nnot obliged to indulge them by pretending to believe that they knew\nanything.

Sandy, oh, Sandy!\"\nSandy approached the carriage, lifting his hat with a slight\nexaggeration of Chesterfieldian elegance. Sandy, no less than his\nmaster, was a survival of an interesting type. He had inherited the\nfeudal deference for his superiors in position, joined to a certain\nself-respect which saved him from sycophancy. His manners had been\nformed upon those of old Mr. Delamere, and were not a bad imitation; for\nin the man, as in the master, they were the harmonious reflection of a\nmental state.\n\"How is Mr. Delamere, Sandy?\" asked Mrs. Carteret, acknowledging Sandy's\nsalutation with a nod and a smile.\n\"He ain't ez peart ez he has be'n, ma'am,\" replied Sandy, \"but he's\ndoin' tol'able well. De doctuh say he's good fer a dozen years yit, ef\nhe'll jes' take good keer of hisse'f an' keep f'm gittin' excited; fer\nsence dat secon' stroke, excitement is dange'ous fer 'im.\"\n\"I'm sure you take the best care of him,\" returned Mrs. Carteret kindly.\n\"You can't do anything for him, Sandy,\" interposed old Mrs. Ochiltree,\nshaking her head slowly to emphasize her dissent. \"All the doctors in\ncreation couldn't keep him alive another year. I shall outlive him by\ntwenty years, though we are not far from the same age.\"\n\"Lawd, ma'am!\" exclaimed Sandy, lifting his hands in affected\namazement,--his study of gentle manners had been more than\nsuperficial,--\"whoever would 'a' s'picion' dat you an' Mars John wuz\nnigh de same age? I'd 'a' 'lowed you wuz ten years younger 'n him, easy,\nef you wuz a day!\"\n\"Give my compliments to the poor old gentleman,\" returned Mrs.\nOchiltree, with a simper of senile vanity, though her back was\nweakening under the strain of the effort to sit erect that she might\nmaintain this illusion of comparative youthfulness. \"Bring him to see me\nsome day when he is able to walk.\"\n\"Yas'm, I will,\" rejoined Sandy. \"He's gwine out ter Belleview nex'\nweek, fer ter stay a mont' er so, but I'll fetch him 'roun' w'en he\ncomes back. I'll tell 'im dat you ladies 'quired fer 'im.\"\nSandy made another deep bow, and held his hat in his hand until the\ncarriage had moved away. He had not condescended to notice the coachman\nat all, who was one of the young negroes of the new generation; while\nSandy regarded himself as belonging to the quality, and seldom stooped\nto notice those beneath him. It would not have been becoming in him,\neither, while conversing with white ladies, to have noticed a colored\nservant. Moreover, the coachman was a Baptist, while Sandy was a\nMethodist, though under a cloud, and considered a Methodist in poor\nstanding as better than a Baptist of any degree of sanctity.\n\"Lawd, Lawd!\" chuckled Sandy, after the carriage had departed, \"I never\nseed nothin' lack de way dat ole lady do keep up her temper! Wid one\nfoot in de grave, an' de other hov'rin' on de edge, she talks 'bout my\nole marster lack he wuz in his secon' chil'hood. But I'm jes' willin'\nter bet dat he'll outlas' her!

Dinah was an excellent hand at\npotato-pone and other culinary delicacies dear to the Southern heart,\nand William was a welcome visitor in her domain.\n\"Now, Aunt Polly,\" said Mrs. Carteret resolutely, as soon as they were\nalone, \"I want to know what you meant by what you said about my father\nand Julia, and this--this child of hers?\"\nThe old woman smiled cunningly, but her expression soon changed to one\nmore grave.\n\"Why do you want to know?\" she asked suspiciously. \"You've got the\nland, the houses, and the money. You've nothing to complain of. Enjoy\nyourself, and be thankful!\"\n\"I'm thankful to God,\" returned Olivia, \"for all his good gifts,--and\nHe has blessed me abundantly,--but why should I be thankful to _you_ for\nthe property my father left me?\"\n\"Why should you be thankful to me?\" rejoined Mrs. Ochiltree with\nquerulous indignation. \"You'd better ask why _shouldn't_ you be\nthankful to me. What have I not done for you?\"\n\"Yes, Aunt Polly, I know you've done a great deal. You reared me in\nyour own house when I had been cast out of my father's; you have been a\nsecond mother to me, and I am very grateful,--you can never say that I\nhave not shown my gratitude. But if you have done anything else for me,\nI wish to know it. Why should I thank you for my inheritance?\"\n\"Why should you thank me? Well, because I drove that woman and her brat\naway.\"\n\"But she had no right to stay, Aunt Polly, after father died. Of course\nshe had no moral right before, but it was his house, and he could keep\nher there if he chose. But after his death she surely had no right.\"\n\"Perhaps not so surely as you think,--if she had not been a negro. Had\nshe been white, there might have been a difference. When I told her to\ngo, she said\"--\n\"What did she say, Aunt Polly,\" demanded Olivia eagerly.\nIt seemed for a moment as though Mrs. Ochiltree would speak no further:\nbut her once strong will, now weakened by her bodily infirmities,\nyielded to the influence of her niece's imperious demand.\n\"I'll tell you the whole story,\" she said, \"and then you'll know what\nI did for you and yours.\" Mrs. Ochiltree's eyes assumed an\nintrospective expression, and her story, as it advanced, became as\nkeenly dramatic as though memory had thrown aside the veil of\nintervening years and carried her back directly to the events which she\nnow described.\n\"Your father,\" she said, \"while living with that woman, left home one\nmorning the picture of health. Five minutes later he tottered into the\nhouse groaning with pain, stricken unto death by the hand of a just God,\nas a punishment for his sins.\"\nOlivia gave a start of indignation, but restrained herself.\n\"I was at once informed of what had happened, for I had means of knowing\nall that took place in the household. Old Jane--she was younger\nthen--had come with you to my house; but her daughter remained, and\nthrough her I learned all that went on.\n\"I hastened immediately to the house, entered without knocking, and\napproached Mr. Merkell's bedroom, which was on the lower floor and\nopened into the hall. The door was ajar, and as I stood there for a\nmoment I heard your father's voice.\n\"'Listen, Julia,' he was saying. 'I shall not live until the doctor\ncomes. But I wish you to know, dear Julia!'--he called her 'dear\nJulia!'--'before I die, that I have kept my promise. You did me one\ngreat service, Julia,--you saved me from Polly Ochiltree!' Yes, Olivia,\nthat is what he said! 'You have served me faithfully and well, and I owe\nyou a great deal, which I have tried to pay.'\n\"'Oh, Mr. Merkell, dear Mr. Merkell,' cried the hypocritical hussy,\nfalling to her knees by his bedside, and shedding her crocodile tears,\n'you owe me nothing. You have done more for me than I could ever repay.\nYou will not die and leave me,--no, no, it cannot be!'\n\"'Yes, I am going to die,--I am dying now, Julia. But listen,--compose\nyourself and listen, for this is a more important matter. Take the keys\nfrom under my pillow, open the desk in the next room, look in the second\ndrawer on the right, and you will find an envelope containing three\npapers: one of them is yours, one is the paper I promised to make, and\nthe third is a letter which I wrote last night. As soon as the breath\nhas left my body, deliver the envelope to the address indorsed upon it.\nDo not delay one moment, or you may live to regret it. Say nothing until\nyou have delivered the package, and then be guided by the advice which\nyou receive,--it will come from a friend of mine who will not see you\nwronged.'\n\"I slipped away from the door without making my presence known and\nentered, by a door from the hall, the room adjoining the one where Mr.\nMerkell lay. A moment later there was a loud scream. Returning quickly\nto the hall, I entered Mr. Merkell's room as though just arrived.\n\"'How is Mr. Merkell?' I demanded, as I crossed the threshold.\n\"'He is dead,' sobbed the woman, without lifting her head,--she had\nfallen on her knees by the bedside. She had good cause to weep, for my\ntime had come.\n\"'Get up,' I said. 'You have no right here. You pollute Mr. Merkell's\ndead body by your touch. Leave the house immediately,--your day is\nover!'\n\"'I will not!' she cried, rising to her feet and facing me with\nbrazen-faced impudence. 'I have a right to stay,--he has given me the\nright!'\n\"'Ha, ha!' I laughed. 'Mr. Merkell is dead, and I am mistress here\nhenceforth. Go, and go at once,--do you hear?'\n\"'I hear, but I shall not heed. I can prove my rights! I shall not\nleave!'\n\"'Very well,' I replied, 'we shall see. The law will decide.'\n\"I left the room, but did not leave the house. On the contrary, I\nconcealed myself where I could see what took place in the room adjoining\nthe death-chamber.\n\"She entered the room a moment later, with her child on one arm and the\nkeys in the other hand. Placing the child on the floor, she put the key\nin the lock, and seemed surprised to find the desk already unfastened.\nShe opened the desk, picked up a roll of money and a ladies' watch,\nwhich first caught her eye, and was reaching toward the drawer upon the\nright, when I interrupted her:--\n\"'Well, thief, are you trying to strip the house before you leave it?'\n\"She gave an involuntary cry, clasped one hand to her bosom and with the\nother caught up her child, and stood like a wild beast at bay.\n\"'I am not a thief,' she panted. 'The things are mine!'\n\"'You lie,' I replied. 'You have no right to them,--no more right than\nyou have to remain in this house!'\n\"'I have a right,' she persisted, 'and I can prove it!'\n\"She turned toward the desk, seized the drawer, and drew it open. Never\nshall I forget her look,--never shall I forget that moment; it was the\nhappiest of my life. The drawer was empty!\n\"Pale as death she turned and faced me.\n\"'The papers!' she shrieked, 'the papers! _You_ have stolen them!'\n\"'Papers?' I laughed, 'what papers? Do you take me for a thief, like\nyourself?'\n\"'There were papers here,' she cried, 'only a minute since. They are\nmine,--give them back to me!'\n\"'Listen, woman,' I said sternly, 'you are lying--or dreaming. My\nbrother-in-law's papers are doubtless in his safe at his office, where\nthey ought to be. As for the rest,--you are a thief.'\n\"'I am not,' she screamed; 'I am his wife. He married me, and the papers\nthat were in the desk will prove it.'\n\"'Listen,' I exclaimed, when she had finished,--'listen carefully, and\ntake heed to what I say. You are a liar. You have no proofs,--there\nnever were any proofs of what you say, because it never happened,--it is\nabsurd upon the face of it. Not one person in Wellington would believe\nit. Why should he marry you? He did not need to! You are merely\nlying,--you are not even self-deceived. If he had really married you,\nyou would have made it known long ago. That you did not is proof that\nyour story is false.'\n\"She was hit so hard that she trembled and sank into a chair. But I had\nno mercy--she had saved your father from _me_--'dear Julia,' indeed!\n\"'Stand up,' I ordered. 'Do not dare to sit down in my presence. I have\nyou on the hip, my lady, and will teach you your place.'\n\"She struggled to her feet, and stood supporting herself with one hand\non the chair. I could have killed her, Olivia! She had been my father's\nslave; if it had been before the war, I would have had her whipped to\ndeath.\n\"'You are a thief,' I said, 'and of that there _are_ proofs. I have\ncaught you in the act. The watch in your bosom is my own, the money\nbelongs to Mr. Merkell's estate, which belongs to my niece, his daughter\nOlivia. I saw you steal them. My word is worth yours a hundred times\nover, for I am a lady, and you are--what? And now hear me: if ever you\nbreathe to a living soul one word of this preposterous story, I will\ncharge you with the theft, and have you sent to the penitentiary. Your\nchild will be taken from you, and you shall never see it again. I will\ngive you now just ten minutes to take your brat and your rags out of\nthis house forever. But before you go, put down your plunder there upon\nthe desk!'\n\"She laid down the money and the watch, and a few minutes later left the\nhouse with the child in her arms.\n\"And now, Olivia, you know how I saved your estate, and why you should\nbe grateful to me.\"",

Three places were taken by Mrs. Carteret, Clara, and\nthe major, leaving the fourth seat vacant.\n\"I've asked Ellis to drive out with us,\" said the major, as he took the\nlines from the colored man who had the trap in charge. \"We'll go by the\noffice and pick him up.\"\nClara frowned, but perceiving Mrs. Carteret's eye fixed upon her,\nrestrained any further expression of annoyance.\nThe major's liking for Ellis had increased within the year. The young\nman was not only a good journalist, but possessed sufficient cleverness\nand tact to make him excellent company. The major was fond of argument,\nbut extremely tenacious of his own opinions. Ellis handled the foils of\ndiscussion with just the requisite skill to draw out the major,\npermitting himself to be vanquished, not too easily, but, as it were,\ninevitably, by the major's incontrovertible arguments.\nOlivia had long suspected Ellis of feeling a more than friendly interest\nin Clara. Herself partial to Tom, she had more than once thought it\nhardly fair to Delamere, or even to Clara, who was young and\nimpressionable, to have another young man constantly about the house.\nTrue, there had seemed to be no great danger, for Ellis had neither the\nfamily nor the means to make him a suitable match for the major's\nsister; nor had Clara made any secret of her dislike for Ellis, or of\nher resentment for his supposed depreciation of Delamere. Mrs. Carteret\nwas inclined to a more just and reasonable view of Ellis's conduct in\nthis matter, but nevertheless did not deem it wise to undeceive Clara.\nDislike was a stout barrier, which remorse might have broken down. The\nmajor, absorbed in schemes of empire and dreams of his child's future,\nhad not become cognizant of the affair. His wife, out of friendship for\nTom, had refrained from mentioning it; while the major, with a delicate\nregard for Clara's feelings, had said nothing at home in regard to his\ninterview with her lover.",

To the\nright, along the distant river-bank, were visible here and there groups\nof turpentine pines, though most of this growth had for some years been\nexhausted. Twenty years before, Wellington had been the world's greatest\nshipping port for naval stores. But as the turpentine industry had moved\nsouthward, leaving a trail of devastated forests in its rear, the city\nhad fallen to a poor fifth or sixth place in this trade, relying now\nalmost entirely upon cotton for its export business.\nOccasionally our party passed a person, or a group of persons,--mostly\nnegroes approximating the pure type, for those of lighter color grew\nnoticeably scarcer as the town was left behind. Now and then one of\nthese would salute the party respectfully, while others glanced at them\nindifferently or turned away. There would have seemed, to a stranger, a\nlack, of spontaneous friendliness between the people of these two races,\nas though each felt that it had no part or lot in the other's life. At\none point the carriage drew near a party of colored folks who were\nlaughing and jesting among themselves with great glee.

As the carriage approached, they became mute and silent as the\ngrave until the major's party had passed.\n\"The negroes are a sullen race,\" remarked the major thoughtfully. \"They\nwill learn their lesson in a rude school, and perhaps much sooner than\nthey dream. By the way,\" he added, turning to the ladies, \"what was the\narrangement with Tom? Was he to come out this evening?\"\n\"He came out early in the afternoon,\" replied Clara, \"to go a-fishing.\nHe is to join us at the hotel.\"\nAfter an hour's drive they reached the hotel, in front of which",

Having turned the trap\nover to a hostler, the major joined a group of gentlemen, among whom was\nGeneral Belmont, and was soon deep in the discussion of the standing\nproblem of how best to keep the negroes down.\nEllis remained by the ladies. Clara seemed restless and ill at ease.\nHalf an hour elapsed and Delamere had not appeared.\n\"I wonder where Tom is,\" said Mrs. Carteret.\n\"I guess he hasn't come in yet from fishing,\" said Clara. \"I wish he\nwould come. It's lonesome here. Mr. Ellis, would you mind looking about\nthe hotel and seeing if there's any one here that we know?\"\nFor Ellis the party was already one too large. He had accepted this\ninvitation eagerly, hoping to make friends with Clara during the\nevening. He had never been able to learn definitely the reason of her\ncoldness, but had dated it from his meeting with old Mrs. Ochiltree,\nwith which he felt it was obscurely connected. He had noticed Delamere's\nscowling look, too, at their last meeting. Clara's injustice, whatever\nits cause, he felt keenly. To Delamere's scowl he had paid little\nattention,--he despised Tom so much that, but for his engagement to\nClara, he would have held his opinions in utter contempt.\nHe had even wished that Clara might make some charge against him,--he\nwould have preferred that to her attitude of studied indifference, the\nonly redeeming feature about which was that it _was_ studied, showing\nthat she, at least, had him in mind. The next best thing, he reasoned,\nto having a woman love you, is to have her dislike you violently,--the\nmain point is that you should be kept in mind, and made the subject of\nstrong emotions. He thought of the story of Hall Caine's, where the\nwoman, after years of persecution at the hands of an unwelcome suitor,\nis on the point of yielding, out of sheer irresistible admiration for\nthe man's strength and persistency, when the lover, unaware of his\nvictory and despairing of success, seizes her in his arms and, springing\ninto the sea, finds a watery grave for both. The analogy of this case\nwith his own was, of course, not strong. He did not anticipate any\ntragedy in their relations; but he was glad to be thought of upon almost\nany terms. He would not have done a mean thing to make her think of him;\nbut if she did so because of a misconception, which he was given no\nopportunity to clear up, while at the same time his conscience absolved\nhim from evil and gave him the compensating glow of martyrdom, it was at\nleast better than nothing.\nHe would, of course, have preferred to be upon a different footing. It\nhad been a pleasure to have her speak to him during the drive,--they had\nexchanged a few trivial remarks in the general conversation. It was a\ngreater pleasure to have her ask a favor of him,--a pleasure which, in\nthis instance, was partly offset when he interpreted her request to mean\nthat he was to look for Tom Delamere. He accepted the situation\ngracefully, however, and left the ladies alone.",

There was an upper\nbalcony and a parlor, with a piano for the musically inclined. To reach\nthese one had to pass along the hall upon which the room mentioned by\nthe bell-boy opened.

Perhaps she suspected him of not having made a very thorough\nsearch. Her next remark might have borne such a construction.\n\"Sister Olivia,\" she said pettishly, \"let's go up to the parlor. I can\nplay the piano anyway, if there's no one to talk to.\"\n\"I find it very comfortable here, Clara,\" replied her sister placidly.\n\"Mr. Ellis will go with you. You'll probably find some one in the\nparlor, or they'll come when you begin to play.\"\nClara's expression was not cordial, but she rose as if to go. Ellis was\nin a quandary. If she went through the hall, the chances were at least\neven that she would see Delamere. He did not care a rap for\nDelamere,--if he chose to make a public exhibition of himself, it was\nhis own affair; but to see him would surely spoil Miss Pemberton's\nevening, and, in her frame of mind, might lead to the suspicion that\nEllis had prearranged the exposure. Even if she should not harbor this\nunjust thought, she would not love the witness of her discomfiture. We\nhad rather not meet the persons who have seen, even though they never\nmention, the skeletons in our closets. Delamere had disposed of himself\nfor the evening. Ellis would have a fairer field with Delamere out of\nsight and unaccounted for, than with Delamere in evidence in his present\ncondition.\n\"Wouldn't you rather take a stroll on the beach, Miss Clara?\" he asked,\nin the hope of creating a diversion.\n\"No, I'm going to the parlor. _You_ needn't come, Mr. Ellis, if you'd\nrather go down to the beach. I can quite as well go alone.\"\n\"I'd rather go with you,\" he said meekly.\nThey were moving toward the door opening into the hall, from which the\nbroad staircase ascended. Ellis, whose thoughts did not always respond\nquickly to a sudden emergency, was puzzling his brain as to how he\nshould save her from any risk of seeing Delamere. Through the side door\nleading from the hall into the office, he saw the bell-boy to whom he\nhad spoken seated on the bench provided for the servants.\n\"Won't you wait for me just a moment, Miss Clara, while I step into the\noffice? I'll be with you in an instant.\"\nClara hesitated.\n\"Oh, certainly,\" she replied nonchalantly.\nEllis went direct to the bell-boy. \"Sit right where you are,\" he said,\n\"and don't move a hair. What is the lady in the hall doing?\"\n\"She's got her back tu'ned this way, suh. I 'spec' she's lookin' at the\npicture on the opposite wall, suh.\"\n\"All right,\" whispered Ellis, pressing a coin into the servant's hand.\n\"I'm going up to the parlor with the lady. You go up ahead of us, and\nkeep in front of us along the hall. Don't dare to look back. I shall\nkeep on talking to the lady, so that you can tell by my voice where we\nare. When you get to room 256, go in and shut the door behind you:\npretend that you were called,--ask the gentlemen what they want,--tell\nany kind of a lie you like,--but keep the door shut until you're sure\nwe've got by. Do you hear?\"\n\"Yes, suh,\" replied the negro intelligently.\nThe plan worked without a hitch. Ellis talked steadily, about the hotel,\nthe furnishings, all sorts of irrelevant subjects, to which Miss\nPemberton paid little attention. She was angry with Delamere, and took\nno pains to conceal her feelings. The bell-boy entered room 256 just\nbefore they reached the door. Ellis had heard loud talking as they\napproached, and as they were passing there was a crash of broken glass,\nas though some object had been thrown at the door.\n\"What is the matter there?\" exclaimed Clara, quickening her footsteps\nand instinctively drawing closer to Ellis.\n\"Some one dropped a glass, I presume,\" replied Ellis calmly.\nMiss Pemberton glanced at him suspiciously. She was in a decidedly\nperverse mood. Seating herself at the piano, she played brilliantly for\na quarter of an hour. Quite a number of couples strolled up to the\nparlor, but Delamere was not among them.\n\"Oh dear!\" exclaimed Miss Pemberton, as she let her fingers fall upon\nthe keys with a discordant crash, after the last note, \"I don't see why\nwe came out here to-night. Let's go back downstairs.\"\nEllis felt despondent. He had done his utmost to serve and to please\nMiss Pemberton, but was not likely, he foresaw, to derive much benefit",

If the\ndoor should have been opened, and she should see him from the hall upon\ntheir return, Ellis could not help it. He took the side next to the\ndoor, however, meaning to hurry past the room so that she might not\nrecognize Delamere.\nFortunately the door was closed and all quiet within the room. On the\nstairway they met the bellboy, rubbing his head with one hand and\nholding a bottle of seltzer upon a tray in the other. The boy was well\nenough trained to give no sign of recognition, though Ellis guessed the\ndestination of the bottle.\nEllis hardly knew whether to feel pleased or disappointed at the success\nof his manoeuvres. He had spared Miss Pemberton some mortification, but\nhe had saved Tom Delamere from merited exposure. Clara ought to know the\ntruth, for her own sake.\nOn the beach, a few rods away, fires were burning, around which several\nmerry groups had gathered. The smoke went mostly to one side, but a\nslight whiff came now and then to where Mrs. Carteret sat awaiting\nthem.\n\"They're roasting oysters,\" said Mrs. Carteret. \"I wish you'd bring me\nsome, Mr. Ellis.\"\nEllis strolled down to the beach. A large iron plate, with a turned-up\nrim like a great baking-pan, supported by legs which held it off the\nground, was set over a fire built upon the sand. This primitive oven was\nheaped with small oysters in the shell, taken from the neighboring\nsound, and hauled up to the hotel by a negro whose pony cart stood near\nby. A wet coffee-sack of burlaps was spread over the oysters, which,\nwhen steamed sufficiently, were opened by a colored man and served\ngratis to all who cared for them.\nEllis secured a couple of plates of oysters, which he brought to Mrs.\nCarteret and Clara; they were small, but finely flavored.",

When they joined the party on the piazza,\nthe major had come up and was saying that it was time to go. He had\nbeen engaged in conversation, for most of the evening, with General\nBelmont and several other gentlemen.\n\"Here comes the general now. Let me see. There are five of us. The\ngeneral has offered me a seat in his buggy, and Tom can go with\nyou-all.\"\nThe general came up and spoke to the ladies. Tom murmured his thanks; it\nwould enable him to make up a part of the delightful evening he had\nmissed.\nWhen Mrs. Carteret had taken the rear seat, Clara promptly took the\nplace beside her. Ellis and Delamere sat in front. When Delamere, who\nhad offered to drive, took the reins, Ellis saw that his hands were\nshaking.\n\"Give me the lines,\" he whispered. \"Your nerves are unsteady and the\nroad is not well lighted.\"\nDelamere prudently yielded the reins. He did not like Ellis's tone,\nwhich seemed sneering rather than expressive of sympathy with one who\nhad been suffering. He wondered if the beggar knew anything about his\nillness. Clara had been acting strangely. It would have been just like\nEllis to have slandered him. The upstart had no business with Clara\nanyway. He would cheerfully have strangled Ellis, if he could have done\nso with safety to himself and no chance of discovery.\nThe drive homeward through the night was almost a silent journey. Mrs.\nCarteret was anxious about her baby. Clara did not speak, except now and\nthen to Ellis with reference to some object in or near the road.\nOccasionally they passed a vehicle in the darkness, sometimes barely\navoiding a collision. Far to the north the sky was lit up with the glow\nof a forest fire. The breeze from the Sound was deliciously cool. Soon\nthe last toll-gate was passed and the lights of the town appeared.\nEllis threw the lines to William, who was waiting, and hastened to help\nthe ladies out.\n\"Good-night, Mr. Ellis,\" said Clara sweetly, as she gave Ellis her hand.\n\"Thank you for a very pleasant evening.

      "text": "\"Oh, well,\" replied McBane, \"just as you say, only I thought you had cut\nyour eye teeth.\"\nDelamere was not pleased with McBane's tone. His remark was not\nacquiescent, though couched in terms of assent. There was a sneering\nsavagery about it, too, that left Delamere uneasy. He was, in a measure,\nin McBane's power. He could not pay the thousand dollars, unless it fell\nfrom heaven, or he could win it from some one else. He would not dare go\nto his grandfather for help. Mr. Delamere did not even know that his\ngrandson gambled. He might not have objected, perhaps, to a gentleman's\ngame, with moderate stakes, but he would certainly, Tom knew very well,\nhave looked upon a thousand dollars as a preposterous sum to be lost at\ncards by a man who had nothing with which to pay it. It was part of Mr.\nDelamere's creed that a gentleman should not make debts that he was not\nreasonably able to pay.\nThere was still another difficulty. If he had lost the money to a\ngentleman, and it had been his first serious departure from Mr.\nDelamere's perfectly well understood standard of honor, Tom might have\nrisked a confession and thrown himself on his grandfather's mercy; but\nhe owed other sums here and there, which, to his just now much disturbed\nimagination, loomed up in alarming number and amount. He had recently\nobserved signs of coldness, too, on the part of certain members of the\nclub. Moreover, like most men with one commanding vice, he was addicted\nto several subsidiary forms of iniquity, which in case of a scandal were\nmore than likely to come to light. He was clearly and most disagreeably\ncaught in the net of his own hypocrisy. His grandfather believed him a\nmodel of integrity, a pattern of honor; he could not afford to have his\ngrandfather undeceived.\nHe thought of old Mrs. Ochiltree. If she were a liberal soul, she could\ngive him a thousand dollars now, when he needed it, instead of making\nhim wait until she died, which might not be for ten years or more, for a\nlegacy which was steadily growing less and might be entirely exhausted\nif she lived long enough,--some old people were very tenacious of life!\nShe was a careless old woman, too, he reflected, and very foolishly kept\nher money in the house. Latterly she had been growing weak and childish.\nSome day she might be robbed, and then his prospective inheritance from\nthat source would vanish into thin air!\nWith regard to this debt to McBane, if he could not pay it, he could at\nleast gain a long respite by proposing the captain at the club. True, he\nwould undoubtedly be blackballed, but before this inevitable event his\nname must remain posted for several weeks, during which interval McBane\nwould be conciliatory. On the other hand, to propose McBane would arouse\nsuspicion of his own motives; it might reach his grandfather's ears, and\nlead to a demand for an explanation, which it would be difficult to\nmake. Clearly, the better plan would be to temporize with McBane, with\nthe hope that something might intervene to remove this cursed\nobligation.\n\"Suppose, captain,\" he said affably, \"we leave the matter open for a few\ndays. This is a thing that can't be rushed. I'll feel the pulse of my\nfriends and yours, and when we get the lay of the land, the affair can\nbe accomplished much more easily.\"\n\"Well, that's better,\" returned McBane, somewhat mollified,--\"if you'll\ndo that.\"\n\"To be sure I will,\" replied Tom easily, too much relieved to resent, if\nnot too preoccupied to perceive, the implied doubt of his veracity.",

I've been associating with some Northern white folks at the\nhotel, and picked up the word from them. You're a high-toned colored\ngentleman, Sandy,--the finest one on the footstool.\"\nStill muttering to himself, Sandy retired to his own room, which was in\nthe house, so that he might be always near his master. He soon returned\nwith a time-stained leather pocket-book and a coarse-knit cotton sock,\nfrom which two receptacles he painfully extracted a number of bills and\ncoins.\n\"You count dat, Mistuh Tom, so I'll know how much I'm lettin' you have.\"\n\"This isn't worth anything,\" said Tom, pushing aside one roll of bills.\n\"It's Confederate money.\"\n\"So it is, suh.

De rest er dem bills is\ngreenbacks,--dey'll pass all right, I reckon.\"\nThe good money amounted to about fifty dollars, which Delamere thrust\neagerly into his pocket.\n\"You won't say anything to grandfather about this, will you, Sandy,\" he\nsaid, as he turned away.\n\"No, suh, co'se I won't!

      "text": "* * * * *\nDelamere went directly to the club, and soon lounged into the card-room,\nwhere several of the members were engaged in play. He sauntered here and\nthere, too much absorbed in his own thoughts to notice that the\ngreetings he received were less cordial than those usually exchanged\nbetween the members of a small and select social club. Finally, when\nAugustus, commonly and more appropriately called \"Gus,\" Davidson came\ninto the room, Tom stepped toward him.\n\"Will you take a hand in a game, Gus?\"\n\"Don't care if I do,\" said the other. \"Let's sit over here.\"\nDavidson led the way to a table near the fireplace, near which stood a\ntall screen, which at times occupied various places in the room.\nDavidson took the seat opposite the fireplace, leaving Delamere with his\nback to the screen.\nDelamere staked half of Sandy's money, and lost. He staked the rest, and\ndetermined to win, because he could not afford to lose. He had just\nreached out his hand to gather in the stakes, when he was charged with\ncheating at cards, of which two members, who had quietly entered the\nroom and posted themselves behind the screen, had secured specific\nproof. A meeting of the membership committee was hastily summoned, it\nbeing an hour at which most of them might be found at the club. To avoid\na scandal, and to save the feelings of a prominent family, Delamere was\ngiven an opportunity to resign quietly from the club, on condition that\nhe paid all his gambling debts within three days, and took an oath never\nto play cards again for money. This latter condition was made at the\nsuggestion of an elderly member, who apparently believed that a man who\nwould cheat at cards would stick at perjury.\nDelamere acquiesced very promptly. The taking of the oath was easy. The\npayment of some fifteen hundred dollars of debts was a different matter.\nHe went away from the club thoughtfully, and it may be said, in full\njustice to a past which was far from immaculate, that in his present\nthoughts he touched a depth of scoundrelism far beyond anything of which\nhe had as yet deemed himself capable. When a man of good position, of\nwhom much is expected, takes to evil courses, his progress is apt to\nresemble that of a well-bred woman who has started on the downward\npath,--the pace is all the swifter because of the distance which must be\ntraversed to reach the bottom. Delamere had made rapid headway; having",

It was the rule of the house when Mr. Delamere\nhad retired, and though he was not at home, habit held its wonted sway.\n\"Just a moment, Sandy.\"\nSandy waited patiently in the hall until the door was opened. If the\nroom showed any signs of haste or disorder, Sandy was too full of his\nown thoughts--and other things--to notice them.\n\"What do you want, Sandy,\" asked Tom.\n\"Mistuh Tom,\" asked Sandy solemnly, \"ef I wuz in yo' place, an' you wuz\nin my place, an' we wuz bofe in de same place, whar would I be?\"\nTom looked at Sandy keenly, with a touch of apprehension. Did Sandy mean\nanything in particular by this enigmatical inquiry, and if so, what? But\nSandy's face clearly indicated a state of mind in which consecutive\nthought was improbable; and after a brief glance Delamere breathed more\nfreely.\n\"I give it up, Sandy,\" he responded lightly. \"That's too deep for me.\"\n\"'Scuse me, Mistuh Tom, but is you heared er seed anybody er anything\ncome in de house fer de las' ten minutes?\"\n\"Why, no, Sandy, I haven't heard any one.

Perhaps you'd like another? I've got\nsomething good here.\"\n\"No, suh, Mistuh Tom, no, suh! No mo' liquor fer me, suh, never! When\nliquor kin make a man see his own ha'nt, it's 'bout time fer dat man\nter quit drinkin', it sho' is! Good-night, Mistuh Tom.\"\nAs Sandy turned to go, Delamere was struck by a sudden and daring\nthought. The creature of impulse, he acted upon it immediately.\n\"By the way, Sandy,\" he exclaimed carelessly, \"I can pay you back that\nmoney you were good enough to lend me this afternoon. I think I'll\nsleep better if I have the debt off my mind, and I shouldn't wonder if\nyou would. You don't mind having it in gold, do you?\"\n\"No, indeed, suh,\" replied Sandy. \"I ain' seen no gol' fer so long dat\nde sight er it'd be good fer my eyes.\"\nTom counted out ten five-dollar gold pieces upon the table at his elbow.\n\"And here's another, Sandy,\" he said, adding an eleventh, \"as interest\nfor the use of it.\"\n\"Thank y', Mistuh Tom.

At the Clarendon Club, where\nhe had gone, a couple of hours before, to verify a certain news item for\nthe morning paper, he had heard a story about Tom Delamere which, he\nimagined, would spike that gentleman's guns for all time, so far as Miss\nPemberton was concerned. So grave an affair as cheating at cards could\nnever be kept secret,--it was certain to reach her ears; and Ellis was\nmorally certain that Clara would never marry a man who had been proved\ndishonorable. In all probability there would be no great sensation\nabout the matter. Delamere was too well connected; too many prominent\npeople would be involved--even Clara, and the editor himself, of whom\nDelamere was a distant cousin. The reputation of the club was also to be\nconsidered. Ellis was not the man to feel a malicious delight in the\nmisfortunes of another, nor was he a pessimist who welcomed scandal and\ndisgrace with open arms, as confirming a gloomy theory of human life.\nBut, with the best intentions in the world, it was no more than human\nnature that he should feel a certain elation in the thought that his\nrival had been practically disposed of, and the field left clear;\nespecially since this good situation had been brought about merely by\nthe unmasking of a hypocrite, who had held him at an unfair disadvantage\nin the race for Clara's favor.",

      "text": "The night was quiet, except for the faint sound of distant music now and\nthen, or the mellow laughter of some group of revelers. Ellis met but\nfew pedestrians, but as he neared old Mr. Delamere's, he saw two men\nwalking in the same direction as his own, on the opposite side of the\nstreet. He had observed that they kept at about an equal distance apart,\nand that the second, from the stealthy manner in which he was making his\nway, was anxious to keep the first in sight, without disclosing his own\npresence. This aroused Ellis's curiosity, which was satisfied in some\ndegree when the man in advance stopped beneath a lamp-post and stood for\na moment looking across the street, with his face plainly visible in the\nyellow circle of light. It was a dark face, and Ellis recognized it\ninstantly as that of old Mr. Delamere's body servant, whose personal\nappearance had been very vividly impressed upon Ellis at the\nchristening dinner at Major Carteret's. He had seen Sandy once since,\ntoo, at the hotel cakewalk. The negro had a small bundle in his hand,\nthe nature of which Ellis could not make out.\nWhen Sandy had stopped beneath the lamp-post, the man who was following\nhim had dodged behind a tree-trunk. When Sandy moved on, Ellis, who had\nstopped in turn, saw the man in hiding come out and follow Sandy. When\nthis second man came in range of the light, Ellis wondered that there\nshould be two men so much alike. The first of the two had undoubtedly\nbeen Sandy. Ellis had recognized the peculiar, old-fashioned coat that\nSandy had worn upon the two occasions when he had noticed him. Barring\nthis difference, and the somewhat unsteady gait of the second man, the\ntwo were as much alike as twin brothers.\nWhen they had entered Mr. Delamere's house, one after the other,--in the\nstillness of the night Ellis could perceive that each of them tried to\nmake as little noise as possible,--Ellis supposed that they were\nprobably relatives, both employed as servants, or that some younger\nnegro, taking Sandy for a model, was trying to pattern himself after his\nsuperior. Why all this mystery, of course he could not imagine, unless\nthe younger man had been out without permission and was trying to avoid\nthe accusing eye of Sandy. Ellis was vaguely conscious that he had seen\nthe other negro somewhere, but he could not for the moment place\nhim,--there were so many negroes, nearly three negroes to one white man\nin the city of Wellington!",

Her\naunt's incomplete disclosures on the day of the drive past the hospital\nhad been weighing upon Mrs. Carteret's mind, and she had intended to\nmake another effort this very day, to get an answer to her question\nabout the papers which the woman had claimed were in existence. Suppose\nher aunt had really found such papers,--papers which would seem to prove\nthe preposterous claim made by her father's mulatto mistress? Suppose\nthat, with the fatuity which generally leads human beings to keep\ncompromising documents, her aunt had preserved these papers? If they\nshould be found there in the house, there might be a scandal, if nothing\nworse, and this was to be avoided at all hazards.\nGuided by some fortunate instinct, Dinah had as yet informed no one but\nMrs. Carteret of her discovery. If they could reach the house before the\nmurder became known to any third person, she might be the first to\nsecure access to the remaining contents of the cedar chest, which would\nbe likely to be held as evidence in case the officers of the law\nforestalled her own arrival.\nThey found the house wrapped in the silence of death. Mrs. Carteret\nentered the chamber of the dead woman. Upon the floor, where it had\nfallen, lay the body in a pool of blood, the strongly marked countenance\nscarcely more grim in the rigidity of death than it had been in life. A\ngaping wound in the head accounted easily for the death. The cedar chest\nstood open, its strong fastenings having been broken by a steel bar\nwhich still lay beside it. Near it were scattered pieces of old lace,\nantiquated jewelry, tarnished silverware,--the various mute souvenirs of\nthe joys and sorrows of a long and active life.\nKneeling by the open chest, Mrs. Carteret glanced hurriedly through its\ncontents. There were no papers there except a few old deeds and letters.\nShe had risen with a sigh of relief, when she perceived the end of a\npaper projecting from beneath the edge of a rug which had been\ncarelessly rumpled, probably by the burglar in his hasty search for\nplunder. This paper, or sealed envelope as it proved to be, which\nevidently contained some inclosure, she seized, and at the sound of\napproaching footsteps thrust hastily into her own bosom.\nThe sight of two agitated women rushing through the quiet streets at so\nearly an hour in the morning had attracted attention and aroused\ncuriosity, and the story of the murder, having once become known, spread\nwith the customary rapidity of bad news. Very soon a policeman, and a\nlittle later a sheriff's officer, arrived at the house and took charge\nof the remains to await the arrival of the coroner.",

The suspicion\nwas not entirely an illogical one. Having been, for generations, trained\nup to thriftlessness, theft, and immorality, against which only thirty\nyears of very limited opportunity can be offset, during which brief\nperiod they have been denied in large measure the healthful social\nstimulus and sympathy which holds most men in the path of rectitude,\ncolored people might reasonably be expected to commit at least a share\nof crime proportionate to their numbers. The population of the town was\nat least two thirds colored. The chances were, therefore, in the absence\nof evidence, at least two to one that a man of color had committed the\ncrime. The Southern tendency to charge the negroes with all the crime\nand immorality of that region, unjust and exaggerated as the claim may\nbe, was therefore not without a logical basis to the extent above\nindicated.\nIt must not be imagined that any logic was needed, or any reasoning\nconsciously worked out. The mere suggestion that the crime had been\ncommitted by a negro was equivalent to proof against any negro that\nmight be suspected and could not prove his innocence. A committee of\nwhite men was hastily formed. Acting independently of the police force,\nwhich was practically ignored as likely to favor the negroes, this\ncommittee set to work to discover the murderer.\nThe spontaneous activity of the whites was accompanied by a visible\nshrinkage of the colored population. This could not be taken as any\nindication of guilt, but was merely a recognition of the palpable fact\nthat the American habit of lynching had so whetted the thirst for black\nblood that a negro suspected of crime had to face at least the\npossibility of a short shrift and a long rope, not to mention more\ngruesome horrors, without the intervention of judge or jury. Since to\nhave a black face at such a time was to challenge suspicion, and since\nthere was neither the martyr's glory nor the saint's renown in being\nkilled for some one else's crime, and very little hope of successful\nresistance in case of an attempt at lynching, it was obviously the part\nof prudence for those thus marked to seek immunity in a temporary\ndisappearance from public view.",

      "text": "About ten o'clock on the morning of the discovery of the murder, Captain\nMcBane and General Belmont, as though moved by a common impulse, found\nthemselves at the office of the Morning Chronicle. Carteret was\nexpecting them, though there had been no appointment made. These three\nresourceful and energetic minds, representing no organized body, and\nclothed with no legal authority, had so completely arrogated to\nthemselves the leadership of white public sentiment as to come together\ninstinctively when an event happened which concerned the public, and, as\nthis murder presumably did, involved the matter of race.\n\"Well, gentlemen,\" demanded McBane impatiently, \"what are we going to do\nwith the scoundrel when we catch him?\"\n\"They've got the murderer,\" announced a reporter, entering the room.\n\"Who is he?\" they demanded in a breath.\n\"A nigger by the name of Sandy Campbell, a servant of old Mr. Delamere.\"\n\"How did they catch him?\"\n\"Our Jerry saw him last night, going toward Mrs. Ochiltree's house, and\na white man saw him coming away, half an hour later.\"\n\"Has he confessed?\"\n\"No, but he might as well. When the posse went to arrest him, they found\nhim cleaning the clothes he had worn last night, and discovered in his\nroom a part of the plunder. He denies it strenuously, but it seems a\nclear case.\"\n\"There can be no doubt,\" said Ellis, who had come into the room behind\nthe reporter. \"I saw the negro last night, at twelve o'clock, going into\nMr. Delamere's yard, with a bundle in his hand.\"\n\"He is the last negro I should have suspected,\" said Carteret. \"Mr.\nDelamere had implicit confidence in him.\"\n\"All niggers are alike,\" remarked McBane sententiously. \"The only way to\nkeep them from stealing is not to give them the chance. A nigger will\nsteal a cent off a dead man's eye. He has assaulted and murdered a white\nwoman,--an example should be made of him.\"\nCarteret recalled very distinctly the presence of this negro at his own\nresidence on the occasion of little Theodore's christening dinner. He\nremembered having questioned the prudence of letting a servant know that\nMrs. Ochiltree kept money in the house. Mr. Delamere had insisted\nstrenuously upon the honesty of this particular negro. The whole race,\nin the major's opinion, was morally undeveloped, and only held within\nbounds by the restraining influence of the white people. Under Mr.\nDelamere's thumb this Sandy had been a model servant,--faithful, docile,\nrespectful, and self-respecting; but Mr. Delamere had grown old, and had\nprobably lost in a measure his moral influence over his servant. Left to\nhis own degraded ancestral instincts, Sandy had begun to deteriorate,\nand a rapid decline had culminated in this robbery and murder,--and who\nknew what other horror? The criminal was a negro, the victim a white\nwoman;--it was only reasonable to expect the worst.\n\"He'll swing for it,\" observed the general.",

It is a murderous and fatal\nassault upon a woman of our race,--upon our race in the person of its\nwomanhood, its crown and flower. If such crimes are not punished with\nswift and terrible directness, the whole white womanhood of the South is\nin danger.\"\n\"Burn the nigger,\" repeated McBane automatically.\n\"Neither is this a mere sporadic crime,\" Carteret went on. \"It is\nsymptomatic; it is the logical and inevitable result of the conditions\nwhich have prevailed in this town for the past year. It is the last\nstraw.\"\n\"Burn the nigger,\" reiterated McBane. \"We seem to have the right nigger,\nbut whether we have or not, burn _a_ nigger. It is an assault upon the\nwhite race, in the person of old Mrs. Ochiltree, committed by the black\nrace, in the person of some nigger. It would justify the white people in\nburning _any_ nigger.

A dead nigger is no loss to any white man. I say,\nburn the nigger.\"\n\"I do not believe,\" said Carteret, who had gone to the window and was\nlooking out,--\"I do not believe that we need trouble ourselves\npersonally about his punishment.

      "text": "then?\"\n\"There'd be a clash,\" declared Watson, \"and instead of one dead negro\nthere'd be fifty. The white people are claiming now that Campbell didn't\nstop with robbery and murder. A special edition of the Morning\nChronicle, just out, suggests a further purpose, and has all the old\nshopworn cant about race purity and supremacy and imperative necessity,\nwhich always comes to the front whenever it is sought to justify some\noutrage on the colored folks. The blood of the whites is up, I tell\nyou!\"\n\"Is there anything to that suggestion?\" asked Miller incredulously.\n\"It doesn't matter whether there is or not,\" returned Watson. \"Merely\nto suggest it proves it.\n\"Nothing was said about this feature until the paper came out,--and even\nits statement is vague and indefinite,--but now the claim is in every\nmouth. I met only black looks as I came down the street. White men with\nwhom I have long been on friendly terms passed me without a word. A\nnegro has been arrested on suspicion,--the entire race is condemned on\ngeneral principles.\"\n\"The whole thing is profoundly discouraging,\" said Miller sadly. \"Try as\nwe may to build up the race in the essentials of good citizenship and\nwin the good opinion of the best people, some black scoundrel comes\nalong, and by a single criminal act, committed in the twinkling of an\neye, neutralizes the effect of a whole year's work.\"\n\"It's mighty easy neut'alize', er whatever you call it,\" said Josh\nsullenly. \"De w'ite folks don' want too good an opinion er de\nniggers,--ef dey had a good opinion of 'em, dey wouldn' have no excuse\nf er 'busin' an' hangin' an' burnin' 'em. But ef dey can't keep from\ndoin' it, let 'em git de right man! Dis way er pickin' up de fus' nigger\ndey comes across, an' stringin' 'im up rega'dliss, ought ter be stop',\nan' stop' right now!\"\n\"Yes, that's the worst of lynch law,\" said Watson; \"but we are wasting\nvaluable time,--it's hardly worth while for us to discuss a subject we\nare all agreed upon. One of our race, accused of certain acts, is about\nto be put to death without judge or jury, ostensibly because he committed\na crime,--really because he is a negro, for if he were white he would not\nbe lynched. It is thus made a race issue, on the one side as well as on\nthe other. What can we do to protect him?\"\n\"We kin fight, ef we haf ter,\" replied Josh resolutely.\n\"Well, now, let us see. Suppose the colored people armed themselves?\nMessages would at once be sent to every town and county in the\nneighborhood. White men from all over the state, armed to the teeth,\nwould at the slightest word pour into town on every railroad train, and\nextras would be run for their benefit.\"\n\"They're already coming in,\" said Watson.\n\"We might go to the sheriff,\" suggested Miller, \"and demand that he\ntelegraph the governor to call out the militia.\"\n\"I spoke to the sheriff an hour ago,\" replied Watson. \"He has a white\nface and a whiter liver. He does not dare call out the militia to\nprotect a negro charged with such a brutal crime;--and if he did, the\nmilitia are white men, and who can say that their efforts would not be\ndirected to keeping the negroes out of the way, in order that the white\ndevils might do their worst? The whole machinery of the state is in the\nhands of white men, elected partly by our votes. When the color line is\ndrawn, if they choose to stand together with the rest of their race\nagainst us, or to remain passive and let the others work their will, we\nare helpless,--our cause is hopeless.\"\n\"We might call on the general government,\" said Miller. \"Surely the\nPresident would intervene.\"\n\"Such a demand would be of no avail,\" returned Watson. \"The government\ncan only intervene under certain conditions, of which it must be\ninformed through designated channels. It never sees anything that is not\nofficially called to its attention. The whole negro population of the\nSouth might be slaughtered before the necessary red tape could be spun\nout to inform the President that a state of anarchy prevailed. There's\nno hope there.\"\n\"Den w'at we gwine ter do?\" demanded Josh indignantly; \"jes' set here\nan' let 'em hang Sandy, er bu'n 'im?\"\n\"God knows!\" exclaimed Miller. \"The outlook is dark, but we should at\nleast try to do something. There must be some white men in the town who\nwould stand for law and order,--there's no possible chance for Sandy to\nescape hanging by due process of law, if he is guilty. We might at least\ntry half a dozen gentlemen.\"\n\"We'd better leave Josh here,\" said Watson. \"He's too truculent. If he\nwent on the street he'd make trouble, and if he accompanied us he'd do\nmore harm than good. Wait for us here, Josh, until we 'we seen what we\ncan do. We'll be back in half an hour.\"\nIn half an hour they had both returned.\n\"It's no use,\" reported Watson gloomily. \"I called at the mayor's office\nand found it locked. He is doubtless afraid on his own account, and\nwould not dream of asserting his authority. I then looked up Judge\nEverton, who has always seemed to be fair. My reception was cold. He\nadmitted that lynching was, as a rule, unjustifiable, but maintained\nthat there were exceptions to all rules,--that laws were made, after\nall, to express the will of the people in regard to the ordinary\nadministration of justice, but that in an emergency the sovereign people\nmight assert itself and take the law into its own hands,--the creature\nwas not greater than the creator. He laughed at my suggestion that Sandy\nwas innocent. 'If he is innocent,' he said, 'then produce the real\ncriminal. You negroes are standing in your own light when you try to\nprotect such dastardly scoundrels as this Campbell, who is an enemy of\nsociety and not fit to live. I shall not move in the matter. If a negro\nwants the protection of the law, let him obey the law.' A wise judge,--a\nsecond Daniel come to judgment! If this were the law, there would be no\nneed of judges or juries.\"\n\"I called on Dr. Price,\" said Miller, \"my good friend Dr. Price, who\nwould rather lie than hurt my feelings. 'Miller,' he declared, 'this is\nno affair of mine, or yours. I have too much respect for myself and my\nprofession to interfere in such a matter, and you will accomplish\nnothing, and only lessen your own influence, by having anything to say.'\n'But the man may be innocent,' I replied; 'there is every reason to\nbelieve that he is.' He shook his head pityingly. 'You are\nself-deceived, Miller; your prejudice has warped your judgment. The\nproof is overwhelming that he robbed this old lady, laid violent hands\nupon her, and left her dead. If he did no more, he has violated the\nwritten and unwritten law of the Southern States. I could not save him\nif I would, Miller, and frankly, I would not if I could. If he is\ninnocent, his people can console themselves with the reflection that\nMrs. Ochiltree was also innocent, and balance one crime against the\nother, the white against the black. Of course I shall take no part in\nwhatever may be done,--but it is not my affair, nor yours. Take my\nadvice, Miller, and keep out of it.'\n\"That is the situation,\" added Miller, summing up. \"Their friendship for\nus, a slender stream at the best, dries up entirely when it strikes\ntheir prejudices. There is seemingly not one white man in Wellington who\nwill speak a word for law, order, decency, or humanity.

      "text": "Miller did not reach his destination without interruption. At one point\na considerable stretch of the road was under repair, which made it\nnecessary for him to travel slowly. His horse cast a shoe, and\nthreatened to go lame; but in the course of time he arrived at the\nentrance gate of Belleview, entering which he struck into a private\nroad, bordered by massive oaks, whose multitudinous branches, hung with\nlong streamers of trailing moss, formed for much of the way a thick\ncanopy above his head. It took him only a few minutes to traverse the\nquarter of a mile that lay between the entrance gate and the house\nitself.\nThis old colonial plantation, rich in legendary lore and replete with\nhistoric distinction, had been in the Delamere family for nearly two\nhundred years. Along the bank of the river which skirted its domain the\nfamous pirate Blackbeard had held high carnival, and was reputed to have\nburied much treasure, vague traditions of which still lingered among the\nnegroes and poor-whites of the country roundabout. The beautiful\nresidence, rising white and stately in a grove of ancient oaks, dated\nfrom 1750, and was built of brick which had been brought from England.\nEnlarged and improved from generation to generation, it stood, like a\nbaronial castle, upon a slight eminence from which could be surveyed\nthe large demesne still belonging to the estate, which had shrunk\ngreatly from its colonial dimensions. While still embracing several\nthousand acres, part forest and part cleared land, it had not of late\nyears been profitable; in spite of which Mr. Delamere, with the\nconservatism of his age and caste, had never been able to make up his\nmind to part with any considerable portion of it. His grandson, he\nimagined, could make the estate pay and yet preserve it in its\nintegrity. Here, in pleasant weather, surrounded by the scenes which he\nloved, old Mr. Delamere spent much of the time during his declining\nyears.\nDr. Miller had once passed a day at Belleview, upon Mr. Delamere's\ninvitation. For this old-fashioned gentleman, whose ideals not even\nslavery had been able to spoil, regarded himself as a trustee for the\ngreat public, which ought, in his opinion, to take as much pride as he\nin the contemplation of this historic landmark. In earlier years Mr.\nDelamere had been a practicing lawyer, and had numbered Miller's father\namong his clients. He had always been regarded as friendly to the\ncolored people, and, until age and ill health had driven him from active\nlife, had taken a lively interest in their advancement since the\nabolition of slavery. Upon the public opening of Miller's new hospital,\nhe had made an effort to be present, and had made a little speech of\napproval and encouragement which had manifested his kindliness and given\nMiller much pleasure.\nIt was with the consciousness, therefore, that he was approaching a\nfriend, as well as Sandy's master, that Miller's mind was chiefly\noccupied as his tired horse, scenting the end of his efforts, bore him\nwith a final burst of speed along the last few rods of the journey; for\nthe urgency of Miller's errand, involving as it did the issues of life\nand death, did not permit him to enjoy the charm of mossy oak or forest\nreaches, or even to appreciate the noble front of Belleview House when",

      "text": "it at last loomed up before him.\n\"Well, William,\" said Mr. Delamere, as he gave his hand to Miller from\nthe armchair in which he was seated under the broad and stately portico,\n\"I didn't expect to see you out here. You'll excuse my not\nrising,--I'm none too firm on my legs. Did you see anything of my man\nSandy back there on the road? He ought to have been here by nine\no'clock, and it's now one. Sandy is punctuality itself, and I don't know\nhow to account for his delay.\"\nClearly there need be no time wasted in preliminaries. Mr. Delamere had\ngone directly to the subject in hand.\n\"He will not be here to-day, sir,\" replied Miller. \"I have come to you\non his account.\"\nIn a few words Miller stated the situation.\n\"Preposterous!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, with more vigor than Miller\nhad supposed him to possess. \"Sandy is absolutely incapable of such a\ncrime as robbery, to say nothing of murder; and as for the rest, that is\nabsurd upon the face of it! And so the poor old woman is dead! Well,\nwell, well! she could not have lived much longer anyway; but Sandy did\nnot kill her,--it's simply impossible! Why, _I_ raised that boy! He was\nborn on my place. I'd as soon believe such a thing of my own grandson\nas of Sandy! No negro raised by a Delamere would ever commit such a\ncrime. I really believe, William, that Sandy has the family honor of the\nDelameres quite as much at heart as I have. Just tell them I say Sandy\nis innocent, and it will be all right.\"\n\"I'm afraid, sir,\" rejoined Miller, who kept his voice up so that the\nold gentleman could understand without having it suggested that Miller\nknew he was hard of hearing, \"that you don't quite appreciate the\nsituation. _I_ believe Sandy innocent; _you_ believe him innocent; but\nthere are suspicious circumstances which do not explain themselves, and\nthe white people of the city believe him guilty, and are going to lynch\nhim before he has a chance to clear himself.\"\n\"Why doesn't he explain the suspicious circumstances?\" asked Mr.\nDelamere. \"Sandy is truthful and can be believed. I would take Sandy's\nword as quickly as another man's oath.\"\n\"He has no chance to explain,\" said Miller. \"The case is prejudged. A\ncrime has been committed. Sandy is charged with it. He is black, and\ntherefore he is guilty. No colored lawyer would be allowed in the jail,\nif one should dare to go there. No white lawyer will intervene. He'll\nbe lynched to-night, without judge, jury, or preacher, unless we can\nstave the thing off for a day or two.\"\n\"Have you seen my grandson?\" asked the old gentleman. \"Is he not looking\nafter Sandy?\"\n\"No, sir. It seems he went down the river this morning to fish, before\nthe murder was discovered; no one knows just where he has gone, or at\nwhat hour he will return.\"\n\"Well, then,\" said Mr. Delamere, rising from his chair with surprising\nvigor, \"I shall have to go myself. No faithful servant of mine shall be\nhanged for a crime he didn't commit, so long as I have a voice to\nspeak or a dollar to spend. There'll be no trouble after I get there,\nWilliam. The people are naturally wrought up at such a crime. A fine old\nwoman,--she had some detestable traits, and I was always afraid she\nwanted to marry me, but she was of an excellent family and had many good\npoints,--an old woman of one of the best families, struck down by the\nhand of a murderer! You must remember, William, that blood is thicker\nthan water, and that the provocation is extreme, and that a few hotheads\nmight easily lose sight of the great principles involved and seek\nimmediate vengeance, without too much discrimination. But they are good\npeople, William, and when I have spoken, and they have an opportunity\nfor the sober second thought, they will do nothing rashly, but will wait\nfor the operation of the law, which will, of course, clear Sandy.\"\n\"I'm sure I hope so,\" returned Miller. \"Shall I try to drive you back,\nsir, or will you order your own carriage?\"\n\"My horses are fresher, William, and I'll have them brought around. You\ncan take the reins, if you will,--I'm rather old to drive,--and my man\nwill come behind with your buggy.\"",

The sheriff, who had seen them from the inside,\ncame to the outer door and spoke to the visitor through a grated wicket.\n\"Mr. Wemyss,\" said Mr. Delamere, when he had made his way to the\nentrance with the aid of his cane, \"I wish to see my servant, Sandy\nCampbell, who is said to be in your custody.\"\nThe sheriff hesitated. Meantime there was some parleying in low tones\namong the crowd outside. No one interfered, however, and in a moment the\ndoor opened sufficiently to give entrance to the old gentleman, after\nwhich it closed quickly and clangorously behind him.\nFeeling no desire to linger in the locality, Miller, having seen his\ncompanion enter the jail, drove the carriage round to Mr. Delamere's\nhouse, and leaving it in charge of a servant with instructions to return\nfor his master in a quarter of an hour, hastened to his own home to meet\nWatson and Josh and report the result of his efforts.",

Oh, Mars John, git me out er dis place!\"\n\"Tut, tut, Sandy!\" answered his master; \"of course I'll get you out.\nThat's what I've come for. How in the world did such a mistake ever\nhappen? You would no more commit such a crime than I would!\"\n\"No, suh, 'deed I wouldn', an' you know I wouldn'!

But dey say dey\n're gwine ter lynch me ternight,--I kin hear 'em talkin' f'm de winders\ner de cell, suh.\"\n\"Well, _I_ say, Sandy, that they shall do no such thing! Lynch a man\nbrought up by a Delamere, for a crime of which he is innocent?\nPreposterous! I'll speak to the authorities and see that you are\nproperly protected until this mystery is unraveled. If Tom had been\nhere, he would have had you out before now, Sandy. My grandson is a\ngenuine Delamere, is he not, Sandy?\"\n\"Yas, suh, yas, suh,\" returned Sandy, with a lack of enthusiasm which he\ntried to conceal from his master. \"An' I s'pose ef he hadn' gone\nfishin' so soon dis mawnin', he'd 'a' be'n lookin' after me, suh.\"\n\"It has been my love for him and your care of me, Sandy,\" said the old\ngentleman tremulously, \"that have kept me alive so long; but now explain\nto me everything concerning this distressing matter, and I shall then be\nable to state your case to better advantage.\"\n\"Well, suh,\" returned Sandy, \"I mought's well tell de whole tale an' not\nhol' nothin' back. I wuz kind er lonesome las' night, an' sence I be'n\ntu'ned outen de chu'ch on account er dat cakewalk I didn' go ter, so\nhe'p me God! I didn' feel like gwine ter prayer-meetin', so I went\nroun' ter see Solomon Williams, an' he wa'n't home, an' den I walk' down\nstreet an' met Josh Green, an' he ax' me inter Sam Taylor's place, an' I\nsot roun' dere wid Josh till 'bout 'leven o'clock, w'en I sta'ted back\nhome. I went straight ter de house, suh, an' went ter bed an' ter sleep\nwidout sayin' a wo'd ter a single soul excep' Mistuh Tom, who wuz\nsettin' up readin' a book w'en I come in. I wish I may drap dead in my\ntracks, suh, ef dat ain't de God's truf, suh, eve'y wo'd of it!\"\n\"I believe every word of it, Sandy; now tell me about the clothes that\nyou are said to have been found cleaning, and the suspicious articles\nthat were found in your room?\"\n\"Dat's w'at beats me, Mars John,\" replied Sandy, shaking his head\nmournfully. \"Wen I lef home las' night after supper, my clo's wuz all\nput erway in de closet in my room, folded up on de she'f ter keep de\nmoths out. Dey wuz my good clo's,--de blue coat dat you wo' ter de\nweddin' fo'ty years ago, an' dem dere plaid pants I gun Mistuh Cohen fo'\ndollars fer three years ago; an' w'en I looked in my closet dis mawnin',\nsuh, befo' I got ready ter sta't fer Belleview, dere wuz my clo's layin'\non de flo', all muddy an' crumple' up, des lack somebody had wo' 'em in\na fight! Somebody e'se had wo' my clo's,--er e'se dere'd be'n some\nwitchcraf, er some sort er devilment gwine on dat I can't make out, suh,\nter save my soul!\"\n\"There was no witchcraft, Sandy, but that there was some deviltry might\nwell be. Now, what other negro, who might have been mistaken for you,\ncould have taken your clothes? Surely no one about the house?\"\n\"No, suh, no, suh. It couldn't 'a' be'n Jeff, fer he wuz at Belleview\nwid you; an' it couldn't 'a' be'n Billy, fer he wuz too little ter wear\nmy clo's; an' it couldn't 'a' be'n Sally, fer she's a 'oman. It's a\nmyst'ry ter me, suh!\"\n\"Have you no enemies? Is there any one in Wellington whom you imagine\nwould like to do you an injury?\"\n\"Not a livin' soul dat I knows of, suh. I've be'n tu'ned out'n de\nchu'ch, but I don' know who my enemy is dere, er ef it wuz all a\nmistake, like dis yer jailin' is; but de Debbil is in dis somewhar, Mars\nJohn,--an' I got my reasons fer sayin' so.\"\n\"What do you mean, Sandy?\"\nSandy related his experience of the preceding evening: how he had seen\nthe apparition preceding him to the house, and how he had questioned Tom\nupon the subject.\n\"There's some mystery here, Sandy,\" said Mr. Delamere reflectively.\n\"Have you told me all, now, upon your honor? I am trying to save your\nlife, Sandy, and I must be able to trust your word implicitly. You must\ntell me every circumstance; a very little and seemingly unimportant bit\nof evidence may sometimes determine the issue of a great lawsuit. There\nis one thing especially, Sandy: where did you get the gold which was\nfound in your trunk?\"\nSandy's face lit up with hopefulness.\n\"Why, Mars John, I kin 'splain dat part easy. Dat wuz money I had lent\nout, an' I got back f'm--But no, suh, I promise' not ter tell.\"\n\"Circumstances absolve you from your promise, Sandy. Your life is of\nmore value to you than any other thing. If you will explain where you\ngot the gold, and the silk purse that contained it, which is said to be\nMrs. Ochiltree's, you will be back home before night.\"\nOld Mr. Delamere's faculties, which had been waning somewhat in sympathy\nwith his health, were stirred to unusual acuteness by his servant's\ndanger. He was watching Sandy with all the awakened instincts of the\ntrial lawyer. He could see clearly enough that, in beginning to account\nfor the possession of the gold, Sandy had started off with his\nexplanation in all sincerity. At the mention of the silk purse, however,\nhis face had blanched to an ashen gray, and the words had frozen upon\nhis lips.\nA less discerning observer might have taken these things as signs of\nguilt, but not so Mr. Delamere.\n\"Well, Sandy,\" said his master encouragingly, \"go on. You got the gold\nfrom\"--\nSandy remained silent. He had had a great shock, and had taken a great\nresolution.\n\"Mars John,\" he asked dreamily, \"you don' b'lieve dat I done dis thing?\"\n\"Certainly not, Sandy, else why should I be here?\"\n\"An' nothin' wouldn' make you b'lieve it, suh?\"\n\"No, Sandy,--I could not believe it of you. I've known you too long and\ntoo well.\"\n\"An' you wouldn' b'lieve it, not even ef I wouldn' say one wo'd mo'\nabout it?\"\n\"No, Sandy, I believe you no more capable of this crime than I would\nbe,--or my grandson, Tom. I wish Tom were here, that he might help me\novercome your stubbornness; but you'll not be so foolish, so absurdly\nfoolish, Sandy, as to keep silent and risk your life merely to shield\nsome one else, when by speaking you might clear up this mystery and be\nrestored at once to liberty. Just tell me where you got the gold,\" added\nthe old gentleman persuasively. \"Come, now, Sandy, that's a good\nfellow!\"\n\"Mars John,\" asked Sandy softly, \"w'en my daddy, 'way back yander befo'\nde wah, wuz about ter be sol' away f'm his wife an' child'en, you\nbought him an' dem, an' kep' us all on yo' place tergether, didn't you,\nsuh?\"\n\"Yes, Sandy, and he was a faithful servant, and proved worthy of all I\ndid for him.\"\n\"And w'en he had wo'ked fer you ten years, suh, you sot 'im free?\"\n\"Yes, Sandy, he had earned his freedom.\"\n\"An' w'en de wah broke out, an' my folks wuz scattered, an' I didn'\nhave nothin' ter do ner nowhar ter go, you kep' me on yo' place, and\ntuck me ter wait on you, suh, didn't you?\"\n\"Yes, Sandy, and you have been a good servant and a good friend; but\ntell me now about this gold, and I'll go and get you out of this, right\naway, for I need you, Sandy, and you'll not be of any use to me shut up\nhere!\"\n\"Jes' hol' on a minute befo' you go, Mars John; fer ef dem people\noutside should git holt er me befo' you _does_ git me out er here, I may\nnever see you no mo', suh, in dis worl'. W'en Mars Billy McLean shot me\nby mistake, w'ile we wuz out huntin' dat day, who wuz it boun' up my\nwoun's an' kep' me from bleedin' ter def, an' kyar'ed me two miles on\nhis own shoulders ter a doctuh?\"\n\"Yes, Sandy, and when black Sally ran away with your young mistress and\nTom, when Tom was a baby, who stopped the runaway, and saved their lives\nat the risk of his own?\"\n\"Dat wa'n't nothin', suh; anybody could 'a' done dat, w'at wuz strong\nernuff an' swif' ernuff. You is be'n good ter me, suh, all dese years,\nan' I've tried ter do my duty by you, suh, an' by Mistuh Tom, who wuz\nyo' own gran'son, an' de las' one er de fam'ly.\"\n\"Yes, you have, Sandy, and when I am gone, which will not be very long,\nTom will take care of you, and see that you never want. But we are\nwasting valuable time, Sandy, in these old reminiscences. Let us get back\nto the present. Tell me about the gold, now, so that I may at once look\nafter your safety. It may not even be necessary for you to remain here\nall night.\"\n\"Jes' one wo'd mo', Mars John, befo' you go! I know you're gwine ter do\nde bes' you kin fer me, an' I'm sorry I can't he'p you no mo' wid it;\nbut ef dere should be any accident, er ef you _can't_ git me out er\nhere, don' bother yo' min' 'bout it no mo', suh, an' don' git yo'se'f\nixcited, fer you know de doctuh says, suh, dat you can't stan'\nixcitement; but jes' leave me in de han's er de Lawd, suh,--_He'll_ look\nafter me, here er hereafter. I know I've fell f'm grace mo' d'n once,\nbut I've done made my peace wid Him in dis here jail-house, suh, an' I\nain't 'feared ter die--ef I haf ter. I ain' got no wife ner child'n ter\nmo'n fer me, an' I'll die knowin' dat I've done my duty ter dem dat\nhi'ed me, an' trusted me, an' had claims on me. Fer I wuz raise' by a\nDelamere, suh, an' all de ole Delameres wuz gent'emen, an' deir\nprinciples spread ter de niggers 'round 'em, suh; an' ef I has ter die\nfer somethin' I didn' do,--I kin die, suh, like a gent'eman! But ez fer\ndat gol', suh, I ain' gwine ter say one wo'd mo' 'bout it ter nobody in\ndis worl'!\"\nNothing could shake Sandy's determination. Mr. Delamere argued,\nexpostulated, but all in vain. Sandy would not speak.\nMore and more confident of some mystery, which would come out in time,\nif properly investigated, Mr. Delamere, strangely beset by a vague\nsense of discomfort over and beyond that occasioned by his servant's\ndanger, hurried away upon his errand of mercy. He felt less confident of\nthe outcome than when he had entered the jail, but was quite as much\nresolved that no effort should be spared to secure protection for Sandy\nuntil there had been full opportunity for the truth to become known.",

      "text": "\"Carteret,\" exclaimed Mr. Delamere, \"what is all this talk about\nlynching my man for murder and robbery and criminal assault? It's\nperfectly absurd! The man was raised by me; he has lived in my house\nforty years. He has been honest, faithful, and trustworthy. He would no\nmore be capable of this crime than you would, or my grandson Tom. Sandy\nhas too much respect for the family to do anything that would reflect\ndisgrace upon it.\"\n\"My dear Mr. Delamere,\" asked Carteret, with an indulgent smile, \"how\ncould a negro possibly reflect discredit upon a white family? I should\nreally like to know.\"\n\"How, sir? A white family raised him. Like all the negroes, he has been\nclay in the hands of the white people. They are what we have made them,\nor permitted them to become.\"\n\"We are not God, Mr. Delamere! We do not claim to have created\nthese--masterpieces.\"\n\"No; but we thought to overrule God's laws, and we enslaved these people\nfor our greed, and sought to escape the manstealer's curse by laying to\nour souls the flattering unction that we were making of barbarous\nnegroes civilized and Christian men. If we did not, if instead of making\nthem Christians we have made some of them brutes, we have only ourselves\nto blame, and if these prey upon society, it is our just punishment! But\nmy negroes, Carteret, were well raised and well behaved. This man is\ninnocent of this offense, I solemnly affirm, and I want your aid to\nsecure his safety until a fair trial can be had.\"\n\"On your bare word, sir?\" asked Carteret, not at all moved by this\noutburst.\nOld Mr. Delamere trembled with anger, and his withered cheek flushed\ndarkly, but he restrained his feelings, and answered with an attempt at\ncalmness:--\n\"Time was, sir, when the word of a Delamere was held as good as his\nbond, and those who questioned it were forced to maintain their\nskepticism upon the field of honor. Time was, sir, when the law was\nenforced in this state in a manner to command the respect of the world!\nOur lawyers, our judges, our courts, were a credit to humanity and\ncivilization. I fear I have outlasted my epoch,--I have lived to hear of\nwhite men, the most favored of races, the heirs of civilization, the\nconservators of liberty, howling like red Indians around a human being\nslowly roasting at the stake.\"\n\"My dear sir,\" said Carteret soothingly, \"you should undeceive yourself.\nThis man is no longer your property. The negroes are no longer under our\ncontrol, and with their emancipation ceased our responsibility. Their\ninsolence and disregard for law have reached a point where they must be\nsternly rebuked.\"\n\"The law,\" retorted Mr. Delamere, \"furnishes a sufficient penalty for\nany crime, however heinous, and our code is by no means lenient. To my\nold-fashioned notions, death would seem an adequate punishment for any\ncrime, and torture has been abolished in civilized countries for a\nhundred years. It would be better to let a crime go entirely unpunished,\nthan to use it as a pretext for turning the whole white population into\na mob of primitive savages, dancing in hellish glee around the mangled\nbody of a man who has never been tried for a crime. All this, however,\nis apart from my errand, which is to secure your assistance in heading\noff this mob until Sandy can have a fair hearing and an opportunity to\nprove his innocence.\"\n\"How can I do that, Mr. Delamere?\"\n\"You are editor of the Morning Chronicle. The Chronicle is the leading\nnewspaper of the city. This morning's issue practically suggested the\nmob; the same means will stop it. I will pay the expense of an extra\nedition, calling off the mob, on the ground that newly discovered\nevidence has shown the prisoner's innocence.\"\n\"But where is the evidence?\" asked Carteret.\nAgain Mr. Delamere flushed and trembled. \"My evidence, sir! I say the\nnegro was morally incapable of the crime. A man of forty-five does not\nchange his nature over-night. He is no more capable of a disgraceful\ndeed than my grandson would be!\"\nCarteret smiled sadly.\n\"I am sorry, Mr. Delamere,\" he said, \"that you should permit yourself to\nbe so exercised about a worthless scoundrel who has forfeited his right\nto live. The proof against him is overwhelming. As to his capability of\ncrime, we will apply your own test. You have been kept in the dark too\nlong, Mr. Delamere,--indeed, we all have,--about others as well as this\nnegro. Listen, sir: last night, at the Clarendon Club, Tom Delamere was\ncaught cheating outrageously at cards. He had been suspected for some\ntime; a trap was laid for him, and be fell into it. Out of regard for\nyou and for my family, he has been permitted to resign quietly, with the\nunderstanding that he first pay off his debts, which are considerable.\"\nMr. Delamere's face, which had taken on some color in the excitement of\nthe interview, had gradually paled to a chalky white while Carteret was\nspeaking. His head sunk forward; already an old man, he seemed to have\naged ten years in but little more than as many seconds.\n\"Can this be true?\" he demanded in a hoarse whisper. \"Is it--entirely\nauthentic?\"\n\"True as gospel; true as it is that Mrs. Ochiltree has been murdered,\nand that this negro killed her. Ellis was at the club a few minutes\nafter the affair happened, and learned the facts from one of the\nparticipants. Tom made no attempt at denial. We have kept the matter out\nof the other papers, and I would have spared your feelings,--I surely\nwould not wish to wound them,--but the temptation proved too strong for\nme, and it seemed the only way to convince you: it was your own test. If\na gentleman of a distinguished name and an honorable ancestry, with all\nthe restraining forces of social position surrounding him, to hold him\nin check, can stoop to dishonor, what is the improbability of an\nilliterate negro's being at least capable of crime?\"\n\"Enough, sir,\" said the old gentleman. \"You have proved enough. My\ngrandson may be a scoundrel,--I can see, in the light of this\nrevelation, how he might be; and he seems not to have denied it. I\nmaintain, nevertheless, that my man Sandy is innocent of the charge\nagainst him. He has denied it, and it has not been proved. Carteret, I\nowe that negro my life; he, and his father before him, have served me\nand mine faithfully and well. I cannot see him killed like a dog,\nwithout judge or jury,--no, not even if he were guilty, which I do not\nbelieve!\"\nCarteret felt a twinge of remorse for the pain he had inflicted upon\nthis fine old man, this ideal gentleman of the ideal past,--the past\nwhich he himself so much admired and regretted. He would like to spare\nhis old friend any further agitation; he was in a state of health where\ntoo great excitement might prove fatal. But how could he? The negro was\nguilty, and sure to die sooner or later. He had not meant to interfere,\nand his intervention might be fruitless.\n\"Mr. Delamere,\" he said gently, \"there is but one way to gain time. You\nsay the negro is innocent. Appearances are against him. The only way to\nclear him is to produce the real criminal, or prove an alibi. If you, or\nsome other white man of equal standing, could swear that the negro was\nin your presence last night at any hour when this crime could have taken\nplace, it might be barely possible to prevent the lynching for the\npresent; and when he is tried, which will probably be not later than\nnext week, he will have every opportunity to defend himself, with you\nto see that he gets no less than justice. I think it can be managed,\nthough there is still a doubt. I will do my best, for your sake, Mr.\nDelamere,--solely for your sake, be it understood, and not for that of\nthe negro, in whom you are entirely deceived.\"\n\"I shall not examine your motives, Carteret,\" replied the other, \"if you\ncan bring about what I desire.\"\n\"Whatever is done,\" added Carteret, \"must be done quickly. It is now\nfour o'clock; no one can answer for what may happen after seven. If he\ncan prove an alibi, there may yet be time to save him. White men might\nlynch a negro on suspicion; they would not kill a man who was proven, by\nthe word of white men, to be entirely innocent.\"\n\"I do not know,\" returned Mr. Delamere, shaking his head sadly. \"After\nwhat you have told me, it is no longer safe to assume what white men\nwill or will not do;--what I have learned here has shaken my faith in\nhumanity. I am going away, but shall return in a short time. Shall I\nfind you here?\"\n\"I will await your return,\" said Carteret.\nHe watched Mr. Delamere pityingly as the old man moved away on the arm\nof the coachman waiting in the hall. He did not believe that Mr.\nDelamere could prove an alibi for his servant, and without some positive\nproof the negro would surely die,--as he well deserved to die.",

      "text": "Mr. Ellis was vaguely uncomfortable. In the first excitement following\nthe discovery of the crime, he had given his bit of evidence, and had\nshared the universal indignation against the murderer. When public\nfeeling took definite shape in the intention to lynch the prisoner,\nEllis felt a sudden sense of responsibility growing upon himself. When\nhe learned, an hour later, that it was proposed to burn the negro, his\npart in the affair assumed a still graver aspect; for his had been the\nfinal word to fix the prisoner's guilt.\nEllis did not believe in lynch law. He had argued against it, more than\nonce, in private conversation, and had written several editorials\nagainst the practice, while in charge of the Morning Chronicle during\nMajor Carteret's absence. A young man, however, and merely representing\nanother, he had not set up as a reformer, taking rather the view that\nthis summary method of punishing crime, with all its possibilities of\nerror, to say nothing of the resulting disrespect of the law and\ncontempt for the time-honored methods of establishing guilt, was a mere\ntemporary symptom of the unrest caused by the unsettled relations of the\ntwo races at the South. There had never before been any special need for\nany vigorous opposition to lynch law, so far as the community was\nconcerned, for there had not been a lynching in Wellington since Ellis\nhad come there, eight years before, from a smaller town, to seek a place\nfor himself in the world of action. Twenty years before, indeed, there\nhad been wild doings, during the brief Ku-Klux outbreak, but that was\nbefore Ellis's time,--or at least when he was but a child. He had come\nof a Quaker family,--the modified Quakers of the South,--and while\nsharing in a general way the Southern prejudice against the negro, his\nprejudices had been tempered by the peaceful tenets of his father's\nsect. His father had been a Whig, and a non-slaveholder; and while he\nhad gone with the South in the civil war so far as a man of peace could\ngo, he had not done so for love of slavery.\nAs the day wore on, Ellis's personal responsibility for the intended\n_auto-da-f\u00e9_ bore more heavily upon him. Suppose he had been wrong? He\nhad seen the accused negro; he had recognized him by his clothes, his\nwhiskers, his spectacles, and his walk; but he had also seen another\nman, who resembled Sandy so closely that but for the difference in their\nclothes, he was forced to acknowledge, he could not have told them\napart. Had he not seen the first man, he would have sworn with even\ngreater confidence that the second was Sandy. There had been, he\nrecalled, about one of the men--he had not been then nor was he now able\nto tell which--something vaguely familiar, and yet seemingly discordant\nto whichever of the two it was, or, as it seemed to him now, to any man\nof that race. His mind reverted to the place where he had last seen\nSandy, and then a sudden wave of illumination swept over him, and filled\nhim with a thrill of horror. The cakewalk,--the dancing,--the\nspeech,--they were not Sandy's at all, nor any negro's! It was a white\nman who had stood in the light of the street lamp, so that the casual\npasser-by might see and recognize in him old Mr. Delamere's servant. The\nscheme was a dastardly one, and worthy of a heart that was something\nworse than weak and vicious.\nEllis resolved that the negro should not, if he could prevent it, die\nfor another's crime; but what proof had he himself to offer in support\nof his theory? Then again, if he denounced Tom Delamere as the murderer,\nit would involve, in all probability, the destruction of his own hopes\nwith regard to Clara. Of course she could not marry Delamere after the\ndisclosure,--the disgraceful episode at the club would have been enough\nto make that reasonably certain; it had put a nail in Delamere's coffin,\nbut this crime had driven it in to the head and clinched it. On the\nother hand, would Miss Pemberton ever speak again to the man who had\nbeen the instrument of bringing disgrace upon the family? Spies,\ndetectives, police officers, may be useful citizens, but they are rarely\npleasant company for other people. We fee the executioner, but we do not\ntouch his bloody hand. We might feel a certain tragic admiration for\nBrutus condemning his sons to death, but we would scarcely invite Brutus\nto dinner after the event. It would harrow our feelings too much.\nPerhaps, thought Ellis, there might be a way out of the dilemma. It\nmight be possible to save this innocent negro without, for the time\nbeing, involving Delamere. He believed that murder will out, but it need\nnot be through his initiative. He determined to go to the jail and\ninterview the prisoner, who might give such an account of himself as\nwould establish his innocence beyond a doubt. If so, Ellis would exert\nhimself to stem the tide of popular fury. If, as a last resort, he\ncould save Sandy only by denouncing Delamere, he would do his duty, let\nit cost him what it might.",

Ellis felt a\npresentiment that this affair, however it might terminate, would be\nfatal to this fine old man, whom the city could ill spare, in spite of\nhis age and infirmities.\n\"Mr. Ellis,\" asked Mr. Delamere, in a voice which trembled with\nill-suppressed emotion, \"do you know who killed her?\"\nEllis felt a surging pity for his old friend; but every step that he had\ntaken toward the jail had confirmed and strengthened his own resolution\nthat this contemplated crime, which he dimly felt to be far more\natrocious than that of which Sandy was accused, in that it involved a\nwhole community rather than one vicious man, should be stopped at any\ncost. Deplorable enough had the negro been guilty, it became, in view of\nhis certain innocence, an unspeakable horror, which for all time would\ncover the city with infamy. \"Mr. Delamere,\" he replied, looking the\nelder man squarely in the eyes, \"I think I do,--and I am very sorry.\"\n\"And who was it, Mr. Ellis?\"\nHe put the question hopelessly, as though the answer were a foregone\nconclusion.\n\"I do not wish to say at present,\" replied Ellis, with a remorseful\npang, \"unless it becomes absolutely necessary, to save the negro's life.\nAccusations are dangerous,--as this case proves,--unless the proof, be\ncertain.\"\nFor a moment it seemed as though Mr. Delamere would collapse upon the\nspot. Rallying almost instantly, however, he took the arm which Ellis\ninvoluntarily offered, and said with an effort:--\n\"Mr. Ellis, you are a gentleman whom it is an honor to know. If you have\ntime, I wish you would go with me to my house,--I can hardly trust\nmyself alone,--and thence to the Chronicle office. This thing shall be\nstopped, and you will help me stop it.\"\nIt required but a few minutes to cover the half mile that lay between",

      "text": "Mr. Delamere went immediately to his grandson's room, which he entered\nalone, closing and locking the door behind him. He had requested Ellis\nto wait in the carriage.\nThe bed had been made, and the room was apparently in perfect order.\nThere was a bureau in the room, through which Mr. Delamere proceeded to\nlook thoroughly. Finding one of the drawers locked, he tried it with a\nkey of his own, and being unable to unlock it, took a poker from beside\nthe stove and broke it ruthlessly open.\nThe contents served to confirm what he had heard concerning his\ngrandson's character. Thrown together in disorderly confusion were\nbottles of wine and whiskey; soiled packs of cards; a dice-box with\ndice; a box of poker chips, several revolvers, and a number of\nphotographs and paper-covered books at which the old gentleman merely\nglanced to ascertain their nature.\nSo far, while his suspicion had been strengthened, he had found nothing\nto confirm it. He searched the room more carefully, and found, in the\nwood-box by the small heating-stove which stood in the room, a torn and\ncrumpled bit of paper. Stooping to pick this up, his eye caught a gleam\nof something yellow beneath the bureau, which lay directly in his line\nof vision.\nFirst he smoothed out the paper. It was apparently the lower half of a\nlabel, or part of the cover of a small box, torn diagonally from corner\nto corner. From the business card at the bottom, which gave the name, of\na firm of manufacturers of theatrical supplies in a Northern city, and\nfrom the letters remaining upon the upper and narrower half, the bit of\npaper had plainly formed part of the wrapper of a package of burnt cork.\nClosing his fingers spasmodically over this damning piece of evidence,\nMr. Delamere knelt painfully, and with the aid of his cane drew out from\nunder the bureau the yellow object which, had attracted his attention.\nIt was a five-dollar gold piece of a date back toward the beginning of\nthe century.\nTo make assurance doubly sure, Mr. Delamere summoned the cook from the\nkitchen in the back yard. In answer to her master's questions, Sally\naverred that Mr. Tom had got up very early, had knocked at her\nwindow,--she slept in a room off the kitchen in the yard,--and had told\nher that she need not bother about breakfast for him, as he had had a\ncold bite from the pantry; that he was going hunting and fishing, and\nwould be gone all day. According to Sally, Mr. Tom had come in about ten\no'clock the night before. He had forgotten his night-key, Sandy was out,\nand she had admitted him with her own key. He had said that he was very\ntired and was going, immediately to bed.\nMr. Delamere seemed perplexed; the crime had been committed later in the\nevening than ten o'clock. The cook cleared up the mystery.\n\"I reckon he must 'a' be'n dead ti'ed, suh, fer I went back ter his room\nfifteen er twenty minutes after he come in fer ter fin' out w'at he\nwanted fer breakfus'; an' I knock' two or three times, rale ha'd, an'\nMistuh Tom didn' wake up no mo' d'n de dead. He sho'ly had a good\nsleep, er he'd never 'a' got up so ea'ly.\"\n\"Thank you, Sally,\" said Mr. Delamere, when the woman had finished,\n\"that will do.\"\n\"Will you be home ter suppah, suh?\" asked the cook.\n\"Yes.\"\nIt was a matter of the supremest indifference to Mr. Delamere whether he\nshould ever eat again, but he would not betray his feelings to a\nservant. In a few minutes he was driving rapidly with Ellis toward the\noffice of the Morning Chronicle. Ellis could see that Mr. Delamere had\ndiscovered something of tragic import. Neither spoke. Ellis gave all his\nattention to the horses, and Mr. Delamere remained wrapped in his own\nsombre reflections.\nWhen they reached the office, they were informed by Jerry that Major",

      "text": "Carteret was engaged with General Belmont and Captain McBane. Mr.\nDelamere knocked peremptorily at the door of the inner office, which was\nopened by Carteret in person.\n\"Oh, it is you, Mr. Delamere.\"\n\"Carteret,\" exclaimed Mr. Delamere, \"I must speak to you immediately,\nand alone.\"\n\"Excuse me a moment, gentlemen,\" said Carteret, turning to those within\nthe room. \"I'll be back in a moment--don't go away.\"\nEllis had left the room, closing the door behind him. Mr. Delamere and\nCarteret were quite alone.\n\"Carteret,\" declared the old gentleman, \"this murder must not take\nplace.\"\n\"'Murder' is a hard word,\" replied the editor, frowning slightly.\n\"It is the right word,\" rejoined Mr. Delamere, decidedly. \"It would be a\nfoul and most unnatural murder, for Sandy did not kill Mrs. Ochiltree.\"\nCarteret with difficulty restrained a smile of pity. His old friend was\nvery much excited, as the tremor in his voice gave proof. The criminal\nwas his trusted servant, who had proved unworthy of confidence. No one\ncould question Mr. Delamere's motives; but he was old, his judgment was\nno longer to be relied upon. It was a great pity that he should so\nexcite and overstrain himself about a worthless negro, who had forfeited\nhis life for a dastardly crime. Mr. Delamere had had two paralytic\nstrokes, and a third might prove fatal. He must be dealt with gently.\n\"Mr. Delamere,\" he said, with patient tolerance, \"I think you are\ndeceived. There is but one sure way to stop this execution. If your\nservant is innocent, you must produce the real criminal. If the negro,\nwith such overwhelming proofs against him, is not guilty, who is?\"\n\"I will tell you who is,\" replied Mr. Delamere. \"The murderer is,\"--the\nwords came with a note of anguish, as though torn from his very\nheart,--\"the murderer is Tom Delamere, my own grandson!\"\n\"Impossible, sir!\" exclaimed Carteret, starting back involuntarily.\n\"That could not be! The man was seen leaving the house, and he was\nblack!\"\n\"All cats are gray in the dark, Carteret; and, moreover, nothing is\neasier than for a white man to black his face. God alone knows how many\ncrimes have been done in this guise! Tom Delamere, to get the money to\npay his gambling debts, committed this foul murder, and then tried to\nfasten it upon as honest and faithful a soul as ever trod the earth.\"\nCarteret, though at first overwhelmed by this announcement, perceived\nwith quick intuition that it might easily be true. It was but a step\nfrom fraud to crime, and in Delamere's need of money there lay a\npalpable motive for robbery,--the murder may have been an afterthought.\nDelamere knew as much about the cedar chest as the negro could have\nknown, and more.\nBut a white man must not be condemned without proof positive.\n\"What foundation is there, sir,\" he asked, \"for this astounding charge?\"\nMr. Delamere related all that had taken place since he had left\nBelleview a couple of hours before, and as he proceeded, step by step,\nevery word carried conviction to Carteret. Tom Delamere's skill as a\nmimic and a negro impersonator was well known; he had himself laughed at\nmore than one of his performances. There had been a powerful motive, and\nMr. Delamere's discoveries had made clear the means. Tom's unusual\ndeparture, before breakfast, on a fishing expedition was a suspicious\ncircumstance. There was a certain devilish ingenuity about the affair\nwhich he would hardly have expected of Tom Delamere, but for which the\nreason was clear enough. One might have thought that Tom would have been\nsatisfied with merely blacking his face, and leaving to chance the\nidentification of the negro who might be apprehended. He would hardly\nhave implicated, out of pure malignity, his grandfather's old servant,\nwho had been his own care-taker for many years. Here, however, Carteret\ncould see where Tom's own desperate position operated to furnish a\nprobable motive for the crime. The surest way to head off suspicion from\nhimself was to direct it strongly toward some particular person, and\nthis he had been able to do conclusively by his access to Sandy's\nclothes, his skill in making up to resemble him, and by the episode of\nthe silk purse. By placing himself beyond reach during the next day, he\nwould not be called upon to corroborate or deny any inculpating\nstatements which Sandy might make, and in the very probable case that\nthe crime should be summarily avenged, any such statements on Sandy's\npart would be regarded as mere desperate subterfuges of the murderer to\nsave his own life. It was a bad affair.\n\"The case seems clear,\" said Carteret reluctantly but conclusively. \"And\nnow, what shall we do about it?\"\n\"I want you to print a handbill,\" said Mr. Delamere, \"and circulate it",

If this is not done, I will go myself and\ndeclare it to all who will listen, and I will publicly disown the\nvillain who is no more grandson of mine. There is no deeper sink of\niniquity into which he could fall.\"\nCarteret's thoughts were chasing one another tumultuously. There could\nbe no doubt that the negro was innocent, from the present aspect of\naffairs, and he must not be lynched; but in what sort of position would\nthe white people be placed, if Mr. Delamere carried out his Spartan\npurpose of making the true facts known? The white people of the city had\nraised the issue of their own superior morality, and had themselves made\nthis crime a race question. The success of the impending \"revolution,\"\nfor which he and his _confr\u00e8res_ had labored so long, depended in large\nmeasure upon the maintenance of their race prestige, which would be\ninjured in the eyes of the world by such a fiasco. While they might yet\nwin by sheer force, their cause would suffer in the court of morals,\nwhere they might stand convicted as pirates, instead of being applauded\nas patriots. Even the negroes would have the laugh on them,--the people\nwhom they hoped to make approve and justify their own despoilment. To be\nlaughed at by the negroes was a calamity only less terrible than failure\nor death.\nSuch an outcome of an event which had already been heralded to the four\ncorners of the earth would throw a cloud of suspicion upon the stories\nof outrage which had gone up from the South for so many years, and had\ndone so much to win the sympathy of the North for the white South and to\nalienate it from the colored people. The reputation of the race was\nthreatened. They must not lynch the negro, and yet, for the credit of\nthe town, its aristocracy, and the race, the truth of this ghastly story\nmust not see the light,--at least not yet.\n\"Mr. Delamere,\" he exclaimed, \"I am shocked and humiliated. The negro\nmust be saved, of course, but--consider the family honor.\"\n\"Tom is no longer a member of my family. I disown him. He has covered\nthe family name--my name, sir--with infamy. We have no longer a family\nhonor. I wish never to hear his name spoken again!\"\nFor several minutes Carteret argued with his old friend. Then he went\ninto the other room and consulted with General Belmont. As a result of\nthese conferences, and of certain urgent messages sent out, within half\nan hour thirty or forty of the leading citizens of Wellington were\ngathered in the Morning Chronicle office. Several other curious persons,\nobserving that there was something in the wind, and supposing correctly\nthat it referred to the projected event of the evening, crowded in with\nthose who had been invited.\nCarteret was in another room, still arguing with Mr. Delamere. \"It's a\nmere formality, sir,\" he was saying suavely, \"accompanied by a mental\nreservation. We know the facts; but this must be done to justify us, in\nthe eyes of the mob, in calling them off before they accomplish their\npurpose.\"\n\"Carteret,\" said the old man, in a voice eloquent of the struggle\nthrough which he had passed, \"I would not perjure myself to prolong my\nown miserable existence another day, but God will forgive a sin\ncommitted to save another's life. Upon your head be it, Carteret, and\nnot on mine!\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Carteret, entering with Mr. Delamere the room where\nthe men were gathered, and raising his hand for silence, \"the people of\nWellington were on the point of wreaking vengeance upon a negro who was\nsupposed to have been guilty of a terrible crime. The white men of this\ncity, impelled by the highest and holiest sentiments, were about to take\nsteps to defend their hearthstones and maintain the purity and\nascendency of their race. Your purpose sprung from hearts wounded in\ntheir tenderest susceptibilities.\"\n\"'Rah, 'rah!\" shouted a tipsy sailor, who had edged in with the crowd.\n\"But this same sense of justice,\" continued Carteret oratorically,\n\"which would lead you to visit swift and terrible punishment upon the\nguilty, would not permit you to slay an innocent man. Even a negro, as\nlong as he behaves himself and keeps in his place, is entitled to the\nprotection of the law. We may be stern and unbending in the punishment\nof crime, as befits our masterful race, but we hold the scales of\njustice with even and impartial hand.\"\n\"'Rah f' 'mpa'tial ban'!\" cried the tipsy sailor, who was immediately\nejected with slight ceremony.\n\"We have discovered, beyond a doubt, that the negro Sandy Campbell, now\nin custody, did not commit this robbery and murder, but that it was\nperpetrated by some unknown man, who has fled from the city. Our\nvenerable and distinguished fellow townsman, Mr. Delamere, in whose\nemployment this Campbell has been for many years, will vouch for his\ncharacter, and states, furthermore, that Campbell was with him all last\nnight, covering any hour at which this crime could have been committed.\"\n\"If Mr. Delamere will swear to that,\" said some one in the crowd, \"the\nnegro should not be lynched.\"\nThere were murmurs of dissent. The preparations had all been made. There\nwould be great disappointment if the lynching did not occur.\n\"Let Mr. Delamere swear, if he wants to save the nigger,\" came again\nfrom the crowd.\n\"Certainly,\" assented Carteret. \"Mr. Delamere can have no possible\nobjection to taking the oath. Is there a notary public present, or a\njustice of the peace?\"\nA man stepped forward. \"I am a justice of the peace,\" he announced.\n\"Very well, Mr. Smith,\" said Carteret, recognizing the speaker. \"With\nyour permission, I will formulate the oath, and Mr. Delamere may repeat\nit after me, if he will. I solemnly swear,\"--\n\"I solemnly swear,\"--\nMr. Delamere's voice might have come from the tomb, so hollow and\nunnatural did it sound.\n\"So help me God,\"--\n\"So help me God,\"--\n\"That the negro Sandy Campbell, now in jail on the charge of murder,\nrobbery, and assault, was in my presence last night between the hours of\neight and two o'clock.\"\nMr. Delamere repeated this statement in a firm voice; but to Ellis, who\nwas in the secret, his words fell upon the ear like clods dropping upon\nthe coffin in an open grave.\n\"I wish to add,\" said General Belmont, stepping forward, \"that it is not\nour intention to interfere, by anything which may be done at this\nmeeting, with the orderly process of the law, or to advise the\nprisoner's immediate release. The prisoner will remain in custody, Mr.\nDelamere, Major Carteret, and I guaranteeing that he will be proved\nentirely innocent at the preliminary hearing to-morrow morning.\"\nSeveral of those present looked relieved; others were plainly,\ndisappointed; but when the meeting ended, the news went out that the\nlynching had been given up. Carteret immediately wrote and had struck\noff a handbill giving a brief statement of the proceedings, and sent out\na dozen boys to distribute copies among the people in the streets. That\nno precaution might be omitted, a call was issued to the Wellington\nGrays, the crack independent military company of the city, who in an\nincredibly short time were on guard at the jail. Thus a slight change\nin the point of view had demonstrated the entire ability of the leading\ncitizens to maintain the dignified and orderly processes of the law\nwhenever they saw fit to do so.",

      "text": "* * * * *\nThe night passed without disorder, beyond the somewhat rough handling of\ntwo or three careless negroes that came in the way of small parties of\nthe disappointed who had sought alcoholic consolation.\nAt ten o'clock the next morning, a preliminary hearing of the charge\nagainst Campbell was had before a magistrate. Mr. Delamere, perceptibly\nolder and more wizened than he had seemed the day before, and leaning\nheavily on the arm of a servant, repeated his statement of the evening\nbefore. Only one or two witnesses were called, among whom was Mr. Ellis,\nwho swore positively that in his opinion the prisoner was not the man\nwhom he had seen and at first supposed to be Campbell. The most\nsensational piece of testimony was that of Dr. Price, who had examined\nthe body, and who swore that the wound in the head was not necessarily\nfatal, and might have been due to a fall,--that she had more than likely\ndied of shock attendant upon the robbery, she being of advanced age and\nfeeble health. There was no evidence, he said, of any other personal\nviolence.\nSandy was not even bound over to the grand jury, but was discharged upon\nthe ground that there was not sufficient evidence upon which to hold\nhim. Upon his release he received the congratulations of many present,\nsome of whom would cheerfully have done him to death a few hours before.\nWith the childish fickleness of a mob, they now experienced a\nsatisfaction almost as great as, though less exciting than, that\nattendant upon taking life. We speak of the mysteries of inanimate\nnature. The workings of the human heart are the profoundest mystery of\nthe universe. One moment they make us despair of our kind, and the next\nwe see in them the reflection of the divine image. Sandy, having thus\nescaped from the Mr. Hyde of the mob, now received the benediction of\nits Dr. Jekyll. Being no cynical philosopher, and realizing how nearly\nthe jaws of death had closed upon him, he was profoundly grateful for\nhis escape, and felt not the slightest desire to investigate or\ncriticise any man's motives.\nWith the testimony of Dr. Price, the worst feature of the affair came to\nan end. The murder eliminated or rendered doubtful, the crime became a\nmere vulgar robbery, the extent of which no one could estimate, since no\nliving soul knew how much money Mrs. Ochiltree had had in the cedar\nchest. The absurdity of the remaining charge became more fully apparent\nin the light of the reaction from the excitement of the day before.\nNothing further was ever done about the case; but though the crime went\nunpunished, it carried evil in its train. As we have seen, the charge\nagainst Campbell had been made against the whole colored race. All over\nthe United States the Associated Press had flashed the report of another\ndastardly outrage by a burly black brute,--all black brutes it seems are\nburly,--and of the impending lynching with its prospective horrors. This\nnews, being highly sensational in its character, had been displayed in\nlarge black type on the front pages of the daily papers. The dispatch\nthat followed, to the effect that the accused had been found innocent\nand the lynching frustrated, received slight attention, if any, in a\nfine-print paragraph on an inside page. The facts of the case never came\nout at all. The family honor of the Delameres was preserved, and the\nprestige of the white race in Wellington was not seriously impaired.\n* * * * *",

This the general did in the course of the afternoon.\n\"Belmont,\" said Mr. Delamere, \"I wish to make my will. I should have\ndrawn it with my own hand; but you know my motives, and can testify to\nmy soundness of mind and memory.\"\nHe thereupon dictated a will, by the terms of which he left to his\nservant, Sandy Campbell, three thousand dollars, as a mark of the\ntestator's appreciation of services rendered and sufferings endured by\nSandy on behalf of his master. After some minor dispositions, the whole\nremainder of the estate was devised to Dr. William Miller, in trust for\nthe uses of his hospital and training-school for nurses, on condition\nthat the institution be incorporated and placed under the management of\ncompetent trustees. Tom Delamere was not mentioned in the will.\n\"There, Belmont,\" he said, \"that load is off my mind. Now, if you will\ncall in some witnesses,--most of my people can write,--I shall feel\nentirely at ease.\"\nThe will was signed by Mr. Delamere, and witnessed by Jeff and Billy,\ntwo servants in the house, neither of whom received any information as\nto its contents, beyond the statement that they were witnessing their\nmaster's will. \"I wish to leave that with you for safe keeping,\nBelmont,\" said Mr. Delamere, after the witnesses had retired. \"Lock it\nup in your safe until I die, which will not be very long, since I have\nno further desire to live.\"\nAn hour later Mr. Delamere suffered a third paralytic stroke, from which\nhe died two days afterwards, without having in the meantime recovered\nthe power of speech.\nThe will was never produced. The servants stated, and General Belmont\nadmitted, that Mr. Delamere had made a will a few days before his death;\nbut since it was not discoverable, it seemed probable that the testator\nhad destroyed it. This was all the more likely, the general was inclined\nto think, because the will had been of a most unusual character. What\nthe contents of the will were, he of course did not state, it having\nbeen made under the seal of professional secrecy.\nThis suppression was justified by the usual race argument: Miller's\nhospital was already well established, and, like most negro\ninstitutions, could no doubt rely upon Northern philanthropy for any\nfurther support it might need. Mr. Delamere's property belonged of right\nto the white race, and by the higher law should remain in the possession\nof white people. Loyalty to one's race was a more sacred principle than\ndeference to a weak old man's whims.\nHaving reached this conclusion, General Belmont's first impulse was to\ndestroy the will; on second thoughts he locked it carefully away in his\nsafe. He would hold it awhile. It might some time be advisable to talk\nthe matter over with young Delamere, who was of a fickle disposition and\nmight wish to change his legal adviser.",

While little was said in\nWellington, public sentiment all over the country became every day more\nfavorable to the views of the conspirators. The nation was rushing\nforward with giant strides toward colossal wealth and world-dominion,\nbefore the exigencies of which mere abstract ethical theories must not\nbe permitted to stand. The same argument that justified the conquest of\nan inferior nation could not be denied to those who sought the\nsuppression of an inferior race. In the South, an obscure jealousy of\nthe negro's progress, an obscure fear of the very equality so\ncontemptuously denied, furnished a rich soil for successful agitation.\nStatistics of crime, ingeniously manipulated, were made to present a\nfearful showing against the negro. Vital statistics were made to prove\nthat he had degenerated from an imaginary standard of physical\nexcellence which had existed under the benign influence of slavery.\nConstant lynchings emphasized his impotence, and bred everywhere a\ngrowing contempt for his rights.",

Dark skins\nlightened two shades; mulattoes turned perfectly white.'\n\"This stuff is rank poison, Jerry,\" continued the general with a mock\nsolemnity which did not impose upon Jerry, who nevertheless listened\nwith an air of great alarm. He suspected that the general was making fun\nof him; but he also knew that the general would like to think that Jerry\nbelieved him in earnest; and to please the white folks was Jerry's\nconsistent aim in life. \"I can see the signs of decay in your face, and\nyour hair will all fall out in a week or two at the latest,--mark my\nwords!\"\nMcBane had listened to this pleasantry with a sardonic sneer. It was a\nwaste of valuable time. To Carteret it seemed in doubtful taste. These\ngrotesque advertisements had their tragic side. They were proof that the\nnegroes had read the handwriting on the wall. These pitiful attempts to\nchange their physical characteristics were an acknowledgment, on their\nown part, that the negro was doomed, and that the white man was to\ninherit the earth and hold all other races under his heel. For, as the\nmonths had passed, Carteret's thoughts, centring more and more upon the\nnegro, had led him farther and farther, until now he was firmly\nconvinced that there was no permanent place for the negro in the United\nStates, if indeed anywhere in the world, except under the ground. More\npathetic even than Jerry's efforts to escape from the universal doom of\nhis race was his ignorance that even if he could, by some strange\nalchemy, bleach his skin and straighten his hair, there would still\nremain, underneath it all, only the unbleached darky,--the ass in the\nlion's skin.\nWhen the general had finished his facetious lecture, Jerry backed out of",

An attempt to darken the lighter spots\nin his cuticle by the application of printer's ink had not proved\nequally successful,--the retouching left the spots as much too dark as\nthey had formerly been too light.\n\"Jerry,\" said Carteret sternly, \"when I hired you to work for the\nChronicle, you were black. The word 'negro' means 'black.' The best\nnegro is a black negro, of the pure type, as it came from the hand of\nGod. If you wish to get along well with the white people, the blacker\nyou are the better,--white people do not like negroes who want to be\nwhite.

It seemed as though this\nnegro thought a white gentleman might want to bribe him to remain away\nfrom the polls; and the negro's willingness to accept the imaginary\nbribe demonstrated the venal nature of the colored race,--its entire\nlack of moral principle!\n\"You will retain your place, Jerry,\" he said severely, \"so long as you\nperform your duties to my satisfaction and behave yourself properly.\"\nWith this grandiloquent subterfuge Carteret turned to his next article\non white supremacy.

The reproduction, in the\nChronicle, of the article from the Afro-American Banner, with Carteret's\ninflammatory comment, took immediate effect. It touched the Southern\nwhite man in his most sensitive spot. To him such an article was an\ninsult to white womanhood, and must be resented by some active\nsteps,--mere words would be no answer at all. To meet words with words\nupon such a subject would be to acknowledge the equality of the negro\nand his right to discuss or criticise the conduct of the white people.\nThe colored people became alarmed at the murmurings of the whites, which\nseemed to presage a coming storm. A number of them sought to arm\nthemselves, but ascertained, upon inquiring at the stores, that no white\nmerchant would sell a negro firearms. Since all the dealers in this sort\nof merchandise were white men, the negroes had to be satisfied with\noiling up the old army muskets which some of them possessed, and the few\nrevolvers with which a small rowdy element generally managed to keep\nthemselves supplied. Upon an effort being made to purchase firearms from\na Northern city, the express company, controlled by local men, refused\nto accept the consignment. The white people, on the other hand, procured\nboth arms and ammunition in large quantities, and the Wellington Grays\ndrilled with great assiduity at their armory.\nAll this went on without any public disturbance of the town's\ntranquillity. A stranger would have seen nothing to excite his\ncuriosity. The white people did their talking among themselves, and\nmerely grew more distant in their manner toward the colored folks, who\ninstinctively closed their ranks as the whites drew away. With each day\nthat passed the feeling grew more tense. The editor of the Afro-American\nBanner, whose office had been quietly garrisoned for several nights by\narmed negroes, became frightened, and disappeared from the town between\ntwo suns.",

A revolution, and not\na riot, was contemplated.\nWith this end in view, another meeting was called at Carteret's office.\n\"We are now ready,\" announced General Belmont, \"for the final act of\nthis drama. We must decide promptly, or events may run away from us.\"\n\"What do you suggest?\" asked Carteret.\n\"Down in the American tropics,\" continued the general, \"they have a way\nof doing things. I was in Nicaragua, ten years ago, when Paterno's\nrevolution drove out Igorroto's government. It was as easy as falling\noff a log. Paterno had the arms and the best men. Igorroto was not\nlooking for trouble, and the guns were at his breast before he knew it.\nWe have the guns. The negroes are not expecting trouble, and are easy\nto manage compared with the fiery mixture that flourishes in the\ntropics.\"\n\"I should not advocate murder,\" returned Carteret. \"We are animated by\nhigh and holy principles. We wish to right a wrong, to remedy an abuse,\nto save our state from anarchy and our race from humiliation. I don't\nobject to frightening the negroes, but I am opposed to unnecessary\nbloodshed.\"\n\"I'm not quite so particular,\" struck in McBane. \"They need to be\ntaught a lesson, and a nigger more or less wouldn't be missed. There's\ntoo many of 'em now.\"\n\"Of course,\" continued Carteret, \"if we should decide upon a certain\nmode of procedure, and the negroes should resist, a different reasoning\nmight apply; but I will have no premeditated murder.\"\n\"In Central and South America,\" observed the general reflectively, \"none\nare hurt except those who get in the way.\"\n\"There'll be no niggers hurt,\" said McBane contemptuously, \"unless they\nstrain themselves running. One white man can chase a hundred of 'em.\nI've managed five hundred at a time. I'll pay for burying all the\nniggers that are killed.\"\nThe conference resulted in a well-defined plan, to be put into operation\nthe following day, by which the city government was to be wrested from\nthe Republicans and their negro allies.\n\"And now,\" said General Belmont, \"while we are cleansing the Augean\nstables, we may as well remove the cause as the effect. There are\nseveral negroes too many in this town, which will be much the better\nwithout them. There's that yellow lawyer, Watson. He's altogether too\nmouthy, and has too much business. Every nigger that gets into trouble\nsends for Watson, and white lawyers, with families to support and social\npositions to keep up, are deprived of their legitimate source of\nincome.\"\n\"There's that damn nigger real estate agent,\" blurted out McBane. \"Billy\nKitchen used to get most of the nigger business, but this darky has\nalmost driven him to the poorhouse. A white business man is entitled to\na living in his own profession and his own home. That nigger don't\nbelong here nohow. He came from the North a year or two ago, and is hand\nin glove with Barber, the nigger editor, which is enough of itself to\ndamn him. _He'll_ have to go!\"\n\"How about the collector of the port?\"\n\"We'd better not touch him. It would bring the government down upon us,\nwhich we want to avoid. We don't need to worry about the nigger\npreachers either. They want to stay here, where the loaves and the\nfishes are. We can make 'em write letters to the newspapers justifying\nour course, as a condition of their remaining.\"\n\"What about Billings?\" asked McBane. Billings was the white Republican\nmayor. \"Is that skunk to be allowed to stay in town?\"\n\"No,\" returned the general, \"every white Republican office-holder ought\nto be made to go. This town is only big enough for Democrats, and\nnegroes who can be taught to keep their place.\"\n\"What about the colored doctor,\" queried McBane, \"with the hospital, and\nthe diamond ring, and the carriage, and the other fallals?\"\n\"I shouldn't interfere with Miller,\" replied the general decisively.\n\"He's a very good sort of a negro, doesn't meddle with politics, nor\ntread on any one else's toes. His father was a good citizen, which\ncounts in his favor. He's spending money in the community too, and\ncontributes to its prosperity.\"\n\"That sort of nigger, though, sets a bad example,\" retorted McBane.\n\"They make it all the harder to keep the rest of 'em down.\"\n\"'One swallow does not make a summer,'\" quoted the general. \"When we get\nthings arranged, there'll be no trouble. A stream cannot rise higher\nthan its fountain, and a smart nigger without a constituency will no\nlonger be an object of fear. I say, let the doctor alone.\"\n\"He'll have to keep mighty quiet, though,\" muttered McBane\ndiscontentedly. \"I don't like smart niggers. I've had to shoot several\nof them, in the course of my life.\"\n\"Personally, I dislike the man,\" interposed Carteret, \"and if I\nconsulted my own inclinations, would say expel him with the rest; but my\ngrievance is a personal one, and to gratify it in that way would be a\nloss to the community. I wish to be strictly impartial in this matter,\nand to take no step which cannot be entirely justified by a wise regard\nfor the public welfare.\"\n\"What's the use of all this hypocrisy, gentlemen?\" sneered McBane.\n\"Every last one of us has an axe to grind! The major may as well put an\nedge on his. We'll never get a better chance to have things our way. If\nthis nigger doctor annoys the major, we'll run him out with the rest.\nThis is a white man's country, and a white man's city, and no nigger has\nany business here when a white man wants him gone!\"\nCarteret frowned darkly at this brutal characterization of their\nmotives. It robbed the enterprise of all its poetry, and put a solemn\nact of revolution upon the plane of a mere vulgar theft of power. Even\nthe general winced.\n\"I would not consent,\" he said irritably, \"to Miller's being disturbed.\"\nMcBane made no further objection.\nThere was a discreet knock at the door.\n\"Come in,\" said Carteret.\nJerry entered. \"Mistuh Ellis wants ter speak ter you a minute, suh,\" he\nsaid.\nCarteret excused himself and left the room.\n\"Jerry,\" said the general, \"you lump of ebony, the sight of you reminds\nme! If your master doesn't want you for a minute, step across to Mr.\nBrown's and tell him to send me three cocktails.\"\n\"Yas, suh,\" responded Jerry, hesitating. The general had said nothing\nabout paying.\n\"And tell him, Jerry, to charge them. I'm short of change to-day.\"\n\"Yas, suh; yas, suh,\" replied Jerry, as he backed out of the presence,\nadding, when he had reached the hall: \"Dere ain' no change fer Jerry dis\ntime, sho': I'll jes' make dat _fo_' cocktails, an' de gin'l won't\nnever know de diffe'nce. I ain' gwine 'cross de road fer nothin', not ef\nI knows it.\"\nHalf an hour later, the conspirators dispersed. They had fixed the hour\nof the proposed revolution, the course to be pursued, the results to be\nobtained; but in stating their equation they had overlooked one\nfactor,--God, or Fate, or whatever one may choose to call the Power that",

      "text": "This conversation relieved Mrs. Carteret's uneasiness. Going to her room\nshortly afterwards, she took the envelope from her bureau drawer and\ndrew out a bulky paper. The haunting fear that it might be such a will\nas her aunt had suggested was now removed; for such an instrument, in\nthe light of what her husband had said confirming her own intuitions,\nwould be of no valid effect. It might be just as well, she thought, to\nthrow the paper in the fire without looking at it. She wished to think\nas well as might be of her father, and she felt that her respect for his\nmemory would not be strengthened by the knowledge that he had meant to\nleave his estate away from her; for her aunt's words had been open to\nthe construction that she was to have been left destitute. Curiosity\nstrongly prompted her to read the paper. Perhaps the will contained no\nsuch provision as she had feared, and it might convey some request or\ndirection which ought properly to be complied with.\nShe had been standing in front of the bureau while these thoughts passed\nthrough her mind, and now, dropping the envelope back into the drawer\nmechanically, she unfolded the document. It was written on legal paper,\nin her father's own hand.\nMrs. Carteret was not familiar with legal verbiage, and there were\nseveral expressions of which she did not perhaps appreciate the full\neffect; but a very hasty glance enabled her to ascertain the purport of\nthe paper. It was a will, by which, in one item, her father devised to\nhis daughter Janet, the child of the woman known as Julia Brown, the sum\nof ten thousand dollars, and a certain plantation or tract of land a\nshort distance from the town of Wellington. The rest and residue of his\nestate, after deducting all legal charges and expenses, was bequeathed\nto his beloved daughter, Olivia Merkell.\nMrs. Carteret breathed a sigh of relief. Her father had not preferred\nanother to her, but had left to his lawful daughter the bulk of his\nestate. She felt at the same time a growing indignation at the thought\nthat that woman should so have wrought upon her father's weakness as to\ninduce him to think of leaving so much valuable property to her\nbastard,--property which by right should go, and now would go, to her\nown son, to whom by every rule of law and decency it ought to descend.\nA fire was burning in the next room, on account of the baby,--there had\nbeen a light frost the night before, and the air was somewhat chilly.\nFor the moment the room was empty. Mrs. Carteret came out from her\nchamber and threw the offending paper into the fire, and watched it\nslowly burn. When it had been consumed, the carbon residue of one sheet\nstill retained its form, and she could read the words on the charred\nportion. A sentence, which had escaped her eye in her rapid reading,\nstood out in ghostly black upon the gray background:--\n\"All the rest and residue of my estate I devise and bequeath to my\ndaughter Olivia Merkell, the child of my beloved first wife.\"\nMrs. Carteret had not before observed the word \"first.\" Instinctively\nshe stretched toward the fire the poker which she held in her hand, and\nat its touch the shadowy remnant fell to pieces, and nothing but ashes\nremained upon the hearth.",

      "text": "dust of earth.\nThe letter remained unread. In her agitation at the discovery of the\nmarriage certificate, Olivia had almost forgotten the existence of the\nletter. It was addressed to \"John Delamere, Esq., as Executor of my Last\nWill and Testament,\" while the lower left hand corner bore the\ndirection: \"To be delivered only after my death, with seal unbroken.\"\nThe seal was broken already; Mr. Delamere was dead; the letter could\nnever be delivered. Mrs. Carteret unfolded it and read:--\nMY DEAR DELAMERE,--I have taken the liberty of naming you as executor of\nmy last will, because you are my friend, and the only man of my\nacquaintance whom I feel that I can trust to carry out my wishes,\nappreciate my motives, and preserve the silence I desire.\nI have, first, a confession to make. Inclosed in this letter you will\nfind a certificate of marriage between my child Janet's mother and\nmyself. While I have never exactly repented of this marriage, I have\nnever had the courage to acknowledge it openly. If I had not married\nJulia, I fear Polly Ochiltree would have married me by main force,--as\nshe would marry you or any other gentleman unfortunate enough to fall in\nthe way of this twice-widowed man-hunter. When my wife died, three years\nago, her sister Polly offered to keep house for me and the child. I\nwould sooner have had the devil in the house, and yet I trembled with\nalarm,--there seemed no way of escape,--it was so clearly and obviously\nthe proper thing.\nBut she herself gave me my opportunity. I was on the point of\nconsenting, when she demanded, as a condition of her coming, that I\ndischarge Julia, my late wife's maid. She was laboring under a\nmisapprehension in regard to the girl, but I grasped at the straw, and\ndid everything to foster her delusion. I declared solemnly that nothing\nunder heaven would induce me to part with Julia. The controversy\nresulted in my permitting Polly to take the child, while I retained the\nmaid.\nBefore Polly put this idea into my head, I had scarcely looked at Julia,\nbut this outbreak turned my attention toward her. She was a handsome\ngirl, and, as I soon found out, a good girl. My wife, who raised her,\nwas a Christian woman, and had taught her modesty and virtue. She was\nfree. The air was full of liberty, and equal rights, and all the\nabolition claptrap, and she made marriage a condition of her remaining\nlonger in the house. In a moment of weakness I took her away to a place\nwhere we were not known, and married her. If she had left me, I should\nhave fallen a victim to Polly Ochiltree,--to which any fate was\npreferable.\nAnd then, old friend, my weakness kept to the fore. I was ashamed of\nthis marriage, and my new wife saw it. Moreover, she loved me,--too\nwell, indeed, to wish to make me unhappy. The ceremony had satisfied her\nconscience, had set her right, she said, with God; for the opinions of\nmen she did not care, since I loved her,--she only wanted to compensate\nme, as best she could, for the great honor I had done my\nhandmaiden,--for she had read her Bible, and I was the Abraham to her\nHagar, compared with whom she considered herself at a great advantage.\nIt was her own proposition that nothing be said of this marriage. If any\nshame should fall on her, it would fall lightly, for it would be\nundeserved. When the child came, she still kept silence. No one, she\nargued, could blame an innocent child for the accident of birth, and in\nthe sight of God this child had every right to exist; while among her\nown people illegitimacy would involve but little stigma. I need not\nsay that I was easily persuaded to accept this sacrifice; but touched by\nher fidelity, I swore to provide handsomely for them both. This I have\ntried to do by the will of which I ask you to act as executor. Had I\nleft the child more, it might serve as a ground for attacking the will;\nmy acknowledgment of the tie of blood is sufficient to justify a\nreasonable bequest.\nI have taken this course for the sake of my daughter Olivia, who is dear\nto me, and whom I would not wish to make ashamed; and in deference to\npublic opinion, which it is not easy to defy. If, after my death, Julia\nshould choose to make our secret known, I shall of course be beyond the\nreach of hard words; but loyalty to my memory will probably keep her\nsilent. A strong man would long since have acknowledged her before the\nworld and taken the consequences; but, alas! I am only myself, and the\natmosphere I live in does not encourage moral heroism. I should like to\nbe different, but it is God who hath made us, and not we ourselves!\nNevertheless, old friend, I will ask of you one favor. If in the future\nthis child of Julia's and of mine should grow to womanhood; if she\nshould prove to have her mother's gentleness and love of virtue; if, in\nthe new era which is opening up for her mother's race, to which,\nunfortunately, she must belong, she should become, in time, an educated\nwoman; and if the time should ever come when, by virtue of her education\nor the development of her people, it would be to her a source of shame\nor unhappiness that she was an illegitimate child,--if you are still\nalive, old friend, and have the means of knowing or divining this thing,\ngo to her and tell her, for me, that she is my lawful child, and ask\nher to forgive her father's weakness.\nWhen this letter comes to you, I shall have passed to--the Beyond; but I\nam confident that you will accept this trust, for which I thank you now,\nin advance, most heartily.\nThe letter was signed with her father's name, the same signature which\nhad been attached to the will.",

      "text": "distribution.\"\nMrs. Carteret lapsed into a troubled silence. Her father _had_ married\nthe woman. In her heart she had no doubt of the validity of the\nmarriage, so far as the law was concerned; if one marriage of such a\nkind would stand, another contracted under similar conditions was\nequally as good. If the marriage had been valid, Julia's child had been\nlegitimate. The will she had burned gave this sister of hers--she\nshuddered at the word--but a small part of the estate. Under the law,\nwhich intervened now that there was no will, the property should have\nbeen equally divided. If the woman had been white,--but the woman had\n_not_ been white, and the same rule of moral conduct did not, _could_\nnot, in the very nature of things, apply, as between white people! For,\nif this were not so, slavery had been, not merely an economic mistake,\nbut a great crime against humanity. If it had been such a crime, as for\na moment she dimly perceived it might have been, then through the long\ncenturies there had been piled up a catalogue of wrong and outrage\nwhich, if the law of compensation be a law of nature, must some time,\nsomewhere, in some way, be atoned for. She herself had not escaped the\npenalty, of which, she realized, this burden placed upon her conscience\nwas but another installment.\nIf she should make known the facts she had learned, it would mean\nwhat?--a division of her father's estate, a recognition of the legality\nof her father's relations with Julia. Such a stain upon her father's\nmemory would be infinitely worse than if he had _not_ married her. To\nhave lived with her without marriage was a social misdemeanor, at which\nsociety in the old days had winked, or at most had frowned. To have\nmarried her was to have committed the unpardonable social sin. Such a\nscandal Mrs. Carteret could not have endured. Should she seek to make\nrestitution, it would necessarily involve the disclosure of at least\nsome of the facts. Had she not destroyed the will, she might have\ncompromised with her conscience by producing it and acting upon its\nterms, which had been so stated as not to disclose the marriage. This\nwas now rendered impossible by her own impulsive act; she could not\nmention the will at all, without admitting that she had destroyed it.\nMrs. Carteret found herself in what might be called, vulgarly, a moral\n\"pocket.\" She could, of course, remain silent. Mrs. Carteret was a good\nwoman, according to her lights, with a cultivated conscience, to which\nshe had always looked as her mentor and infallible guide.\nHence Mrs. Carteret, after this painful discovery, remained for a long\ntime ill at ease,--so disturbed, indeed, that her mind reacted upon her\nnerves, which had never been strong; and her nervousness affected her\nstrength, which had never been great, until Carteret, whose love for her\nhad been deepened and strengthened by the advent of his son, became\nalarmed for her health, and spoke very seriously to Dr. Price concerning\nit.",

Overhead the swelling sail served as\nan awning to keep off the sun's rays, which far ahead were reflected\nwith dazzling brilliancy from the shores of a golden island. Her son,\nshe dreamed, was a fairy prince, and yonder lay his kingdom, to which he\nwas being borne, lying there at her feet, in this beautiful boat, across\nthe sunlit sea.\nSuddenly and without warning the sky was overcast. A squall struck the\nboat and tore away the sail. In the distance a huge billow--a great\nwhite wall of water--came sweeping toward their frail craft, threatening\nit with instant destruction. She clasped her child to her bosom, and a\nmoment later found herself struggling in the sea, holding the child's\nhead above the water. As she floated there, as though sustained by some\nunseen force, she saw in the distance a small boat approaching over the\nstorm-tossed waves. Straight toward her it came, and she had reached out\nher hand to grasp its side, when the rower looked back, and she saw that\nit was her sister. The recognition had been mutual. With a sharp\nmovement of one oar the boat glided by, leaving her clutching at the\nempty air. She felt her strength begin to fail. Despairingly she\nsignaled with her disengaged hand; but the rower, after one mute,\nreproachful glance, rowed on. Mrs. Carteret's strength grew less and\nless. The child became heavy as lead. Herself floating in the water, as\nthough it were her native element, she could no longer support the\nchild. Lower and lower it sank,--she was powerless to save it or to\naccompany it,--until, gasping wildly for breath, it threw up its little\nhands and sank, the cruel water gurgling over its head,--when she awoke\nwith a start and a chill, and lay there trembling for several minutes",

      "text": "before she heard little Dodie in his crib, breathing heavily.\nShe rose softly, went to the crib, and changed the child's position to\nan easier one. He breathed more freely, and she went back to bed, but\nnot to sleep.\nShe had tried to put aside the distressing questions raised by the\ndiscovery of her father's will and the papers accompanying it. Why\nshould she be burdened with such a responsibility, at this late day,\nwhen the touch of time had well-nigh healed these old sores? Surely, God\nhad put his curse not alone upon the slave, but upon the stealer of men!\nWith other good people she had thanked Him that slavery was no more, and\nthat those who once had borne its burden upon their consciences could\nstand erect and feel that they themselves were free. The weed had been\ncut down, but its roots remained, deeply imbedded in the soil, to spring\nup and trouble a new generation. Upon her weak shoulders was placed the\nburden of her father's weakness, her father's folly. It was left to her\nto acknowledge or not this shameful marriage and her sister's rights in\ntheir father's estate.\nBalancing one consideration against another, she had almost decided\nthat she might ignore this tie. To herself, Olivia Merkell,--Olivia\nCarteret,--the stigma of base birth would have meant social ostracism,\nsocial ruin, the averted face, the finger of pity or of scorn. All the\ntraditional weight of public disapproval would have fallen upon her as\nthe unhappy fruit of an unblessed union. To this other woman it could\nhave had no such significance,--it had been the lot of her race. To\nthem, twenty-five years before, sexual sin had never been imputed as\nmore than a fault. She had lost nothing by her supposed illegitimacy;\nshe would gain nothing by the acknowledgment of her mother's marriage.\nOn the other hand, what would be the effect of this revelation upon Mrs.\nCarteret herself? To have it known that her father had married a negress\nwould only be less dreadful than to have it appear that he had committed\nsome terrible crime. It was a crime now, by the laws of every Southern\nState, for white and colored persons to intermarry. She shuddered before\nthe possibility that at some time in the future some person, none too\nwell informed, might learn that her father had married a colored woman,\nand might assume that she, Olivia Carteret, or her child, had sprung\nfrom this shocking _m\u00e9salliance_,--a fate to which she would willingly\nhave preferred death. No, this marriage must never be made known; the\nsecret should remain buried forever in her own heart!\nBut there still remained the question of her father's property and her\nfather's will. This woman was her father's child,--of that there could\nbe no doubt, it was written in her features no less than in her father's\nwill. As his lawful child,--of which, alas! there could also be no\nquestion,--she was entitled by law to half his estate. Mrs. Carteret's\nproblem had sunk from the realm of sentiment to that of material things,\nwhich, curiously enough, she found much more difficult. For, while the\nnegro, by the traditions of her people, was barred from the world of\nsentiment, his rights of property were recognized. The question had\nbecome, with Mrs. Carteret, a question of _meum_ and _tuum_. Had the\ngirl Janet been poor, ignorant, or degraded, as might well have been her\nfate, Mrs. Carteret might have felt a vicarious remorse for her aunt's\nsuppression of the papers; but fate had compensated Janet for the loss;\nshe had been educated, she had married well; she had not suffered for\nlack of the money of which she had been defrauded, and did not need it\nnow. She had a child, it is true, but this child's career would be so\ncircumscribed by the accident of color that too much wealth would only\nbe a source of unhappiness; to her own child, on the contrary, it would\nopen every door of life.\nIt would be too lengthy a task to follow the mind and conscience of this\nmuch-tried lady in their intricate workings upon this difficult problem;\nfor she had a mind as logical as any woman's, and a conscience which she\nwished to keep void of offense. She had to confront a situation\ninvolving the element of race, upon which the moral standards of her\npeople were hopelessly confused. Mrs. Carteret reached the conclusion,\nere daylight dawned, that she would be silent upon the subject of her\nfather's second marriage. Neither party had wished it known,--neither\nJulia nor her father,--and she would respect her father's wishes. To act\notherwise would be to defeat his will, to make known what he had\ncarefully concealed, and to give Janet a claim of title to one half her\nfather's estate, while he had only meant her to have the ten thousand\ndollars named in the will.\nBy the same reasoning, she must carry out her father's will in respect\nto this bequest. Here there was another difficulty. The mining\ninvestment into which they had entered shortly after the birth of little\nDodie had tied up so much of her property that it would have been\ndifficult to procure ten thousand dollars immediately; while a demand\nfor half the property at once would mean bankruptcy and ruin. Moreover,\nupon what ground could she offer her sister any sum of money whatever?\nSo sudden a change of heart, after so many years of silence, would raise\nthe presumption of some right on the part of Janet in her father's\nestate. Suspicion once aroused, it might be possible to trace this\nhidden marriage, and establish it by legal proof. The marriage once\nverified, the claim for half the estate could not be denied. She could\nnot plead her father's will to the contrary, for this would be to\nacknowledge the suppression of the will, in itself a criminal act.\nThere was, however, a way of escape. This hospital which had recently\nbeen opened was the personal property of her sister's husband. Some time\nin the future, when their investments matured, she would present to the\nhospital a sum of money equal to the amount her father had meant his\ncolored daughter to have. Thus indirectly both her father's will and her\nown conscience would be satisfied.\nMrs. Carteret had reached this comfortable conclusion, and was falling\nasleep, when her attention was again drawn by her child's breathing. She\ntook it in her own arms and soon fell asleep.",

The new nurse was by\nno means an ideal nurse,--Mammy Jane understood the child much better.\nIf there should be any trouble with the negroes, toward which her\nhusband's remark seemed to point,--she knew the general political\nsituation, though not informed in regard to her husband's plans,--she\nwould like to have Mammy Jane near her, where the old nurse might be\nprotected from danger or alarm.\nWith this end in view she dispatched the nurse, shortly after breakfast,\nto Mammy Jane's house in the negro settlement on the other side of the\ntown, with a message asking the old woman to come immediately to Mrs.\nCarteret's. Unfortunately, Mammy Jane had gone to visit a sick woman in\nthe country, and was not expected to return for several hours.",

A salt-laden breeze from\nthe ocean a few miles away lent a crisp sparkle to the air.\nAt three o'clock sharp the streets were filled, as if by magic, with\narmed white men. The negroes, going about, had noted, with uneasy\ncuriosity, that the stores and places of business, many of which closed\nat noon, were unduly late in opening for the afternoon, though no one\nsuspected the reason for the delay; but at three o'clock every passing\ncolored man was ordered, by the first white man he met, to throw up his\nhands. If he complied, he was searched, more or less roughly, for\nfirearms, and then warned to get off the street. When he met another\ngroup of white men the scene was repeated. The man thus summarily held\nup seldom encountered more than two groups before disappearing across\nlots to his own home or some convenient hiding-place. If he resisted any\ndemand of those who halted him--But the records of the day are\nhistorical; they may be found in the newspapers of the following date,\nbut they are more firmly engraved upon the hearts and memories of the\npeople of Wellington.

      "text": "Miller pulled up his horse and looked after them in startled wonder.\n\"What on earth can be the matter?\" he muttered, struck with a vague\nfeeling of alarm. A psychologist, seeking to trace the effects of\nslavery upon the human mind, might find in the South many a curious\nillustration of this curse, abiding long after the actual physical\nbondage had terminated. In the olden time the white South labored under\nthe constant fear of negro insurrections. Knowing that they themselves,\nif in the negroes' place, would have risen in the effort to throw off\nthe yoke, all their reiterated theories of negro subordination and\ninferiority could not remove that lurking fear, founded upon the obscure\nconsciousness that the slaves ought to have risen. Conscience, it has\nbeen said, makes cowards of us all. There was never, on the continent of\nAmerica, a successful slave revolt, nor one which lasted more than a few\nhours, or resulted in the loss of more than a few white lives; yet never\nwas the planter quite free from the fear that there might be one.\nOn the other hand, the slave had before his eyes always the fear of the\nmaster. There were good men, according to their lights,--according to\ntheir training and environment,--among the Southern slaveholders, who\ntreated their slaves kindly, as slaves, from principle, because they\nrecognized the claims of humanity, even under the dark skin of a human\nchattel. There was many a one who protected or pampered his negroes, as\nthe case might be, just as a man fondles his dog,--because they were\nhis; they were a part of his estate, an integral part of the entity of\nproperty and person which made up the aristocrat; but with all this\nkindness, there was always present, in the consciousness of the lowest\nslave, the knowledge that he was in his master's power, and that he\ncould make no effectual protest against the abuse of that authority.\nThere was also the knowledge, among those who could think at all, that\nthe best of masters was himself a slave to a system, which hampered his\nmovements but scarcely less than those of his bondmen.\nWhen, therefore, Miller saw these men and women scampering into the\nbushes, he divined, with this slumbering race consciousness which years\nof culture had not obliterated, that there was some race trouble on\nfoot. His intuition did not long remain unsupported. A black head was\ncautiously protruded from the shrubbery, and a black voice--if such a\ndescription be allowable--addressed him:--\n\"Is dat you, Doctuh Miller?\"\n\"Yes. Who are you, and what's the trouble?\"\n\"What's de trouble, suh? Why, all hell's broke loose in town yonduh. De\nw'ite folks is riz 'gins' de niggers, an' say dey're gwine ter kill\neve'y nigger dey kin lay han's on.\"\nMiller's heart leaped to his throat, as he thought of his wife and\nchild. This story was preposterous; it could not be true, and yet there\nmust be something in it. He tried to question his informant, but the man\nwas so overcome with excitement and fear that Miller saw clearly that he\nmust go farther for information. He had read in the Morning Chronicle, a\nfew days before, the obnoxious editorial quoted from the Afro-American\nBanner, and had noted the comment upon it by the white editor. He had\nfelt, as at the time of its first publication, that the editorial was\nill-advised. It could do no good, and was calculated to arouse the\nanimosity of those whose friendship, whose tolerance, at least, was\nnecessary and almost indispensable to the colored people. They were\nliving, at the best, in a sort of armed neutrality with the whites; such\na publication, however serviceable elsewhere, could have no other\neffect in Wellington than to endanger this truce and defeat the hope of\na possible future friendship. The right of free speech entitled Barber\nto publish it; a larger measure of common-sense would have made him\nwithhold it. Whether it was the republication of this article that had\nstirred up anew the sleeping dogs of race prejudice and whetted their\nthirst for blood, he could not yet tell; but at any rate, there was\nmischief on foot.\n\"Fer God's sake, doctuh, don' go no closeter ter dat town,\" pleaded his\ninformant, \"er you'll be killt sho'. Come on wid us, suh, an' tek keer\ner yo'se'f. We're gwine ter hide in de swamps till dis thing is over!\"",

To\none unfamiliar with Southern life, it might have seemed impossible that\nthese good Christian people, who thronged the churches on Sunday, and\nwept over the sufferings of the lowly Nazarene, and sent missionaries to\nthe heathen, could be hungering and thirsting for the blood of their\nfellow men; but Miller cherished no such delusion. He knew the history\nof his country; he had the threatened lynching of Sandy Campbell vividly\nin mind; and he was fully persuaded that to race prejudice, once roused,\nany horror was possible. That women or children would be molested of set\npurpose he did not believe, but that they might suffer by accident was\nmore than likely.\nAs he neared the town, dashing forward at the top of his horse's speed,\nhe heard his voice called in a loud and agitated tone, and, glancing\naround him, saw a familiar form standing by the roadside, gesticulating\nvehemently.\nHe drew up the horse with a suddenness that threw the faithful and\nobedient animal back upon its haunches. The colored lawyer, Watson, came\nup to the buggy. That he was laboring under great and unusual excitement\nwas quite apparent from his pale face and frightened air.\n\"What's the matter, Watson?\" demanded Miller, hoping now to obtain some\nreliable information.\n\"Matter!\" exclaimed the other. \"Everything's the matter! The white\npeople are up in arms. They have disarmed the colored people, killing\nhalf a dozen in the process, and wounding as many more. They have forced\nthe mayor and aldermen to resign, have formed a provisional city\ngovernment _\u00e0 la Fran\u00e7aise_, and have ordered me and half a dozen other\nfellows to leave town in forty-eight hours, under pain of sudden death.\nAs they seem to mean it, I shall not stay so long. Fortunately, my wife\nand children are away. I knew you were out here, however, and I thought\nI'd come out and wait for you, so that we might talk the matter over. I\ndon't imagine they mean you any harm, personally, because you tread on\nnobody's toes; but you're too valuable a man for the race to lose, so I\nthought I'd give you warning. I shall want to sell you my property,\ntoo, at a bargain. For I'm worth too much to my family to dream of ever\nattempting to live here again.\"\n\"Have you seen anything of my wife and child?\" asked Miller, intent upon\nthe danger to which they might be exposed.\n\"No; I didn't go to the house. I inquired at the drugstore and found\nout where you had gone. You needn't fear for them,--it is not a war on\nwomen and children.\"\n\"War of any kind is always hardest on the women and children,\" returned\nMiller; \"I must hurry on and see that mine are safe.\"\n\"They'll not carry the war so far into Africa as that,\" returned\nWatson; \"but I never saw anything like it. Yesterday I had a hundred\nwhite friends in the town, or thought I had,--men who spoke pleasantly\nto me on the street, and sometimes gave me their hands to shake. Not one\nof them said to me today: 'Watson, stay at home this afternoon.' I might\nhave been killed, like any one of half a dozen others who have bit the\ndust, for any word that one of my 'friends' had said to warn me. When\nthe race cry is started in this neck of the woods, friendship, religion,\nhumanity, reason, all shrivel up like dry leaves in a raging furnace.\"\nThe buggy, into which Watson had climbed, was meanwhile rapidly nearing\nthe town.\n\"I think I'll leave you here, Miller,\" said Watson, as they approached\nthe outskirts, \"and make my way home by a roundabout path, as I should\nlike to get there unmolested. Home!--a beautiful word that, isn't it,\nfor an exiled wanderer? It might not be well, either, for us to be seen\ntogether. If you put the hood of your buggy down, and sit well back in\nthe shadow, you may be able to reach home without interruption; but\navoid the main streets.

I am to be dismissed from\nthe community with public honors.\" Watson was climbing down from the\nbuggy, when a small party of men were seen approaching, and big Josh\nGreen, followed by several other resolute-looking colored men, came up\nand addressed them.\n\"Dr. Miller,\" cried Green, \"Mr. Watson,--we're lookin' fer a leader. De\nw'ite folks are killin' de niggers, an' we ain' gwine ter stan' up an'\nbe shot down like dogs. We're gwine ter defen' ou' lives, an' we ain'\ngwine ter run away f'm no place where we 'we got a right ter be; an' woe\nbe ter de w'ite man w'at lays ban's on us! Dere's two niggers in dis\ntown ter eve'y w'ite man, an' ef we 'we got ter be killt, we'll take\nsome w'ite folks 'long wid us, ez sho' ez dere's a God in heaven,--ez I\ns'pose dere is, dough He mus' be 'sleep, er busy somewhar e'se ter-day.\nWill you-all come an' lead us?\"\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Watson, \"what is the use? The negroes will not back\nyou up. They haven't the arms, nor the moral courage, nor the\nleadership.\"\n\"We'll git de arms, an' we'll git de courage, ef you'll come an' lead\nus! We wants leaders,--dat's w'y we come ter you!\"\n\"What's the use?\" returned Watson despairingly. \"The odds are too heavy.\nI've been ordered out of town; if I stayed, I'd be shot on sight,\nunless I had a body-guard around me.\"\n\"We'll be yo' body-guard!\" shouted half a dozen voices.\n\"And when my body-guard was shot, what then? I have a wife and children.\nIt is my duty to live for them. If I died, I should get no glory and no\nreward, and my family would be reduced to beggary,--to which they'll\nsoon be near enough as it is. This affair will blow over in a day or\ntwo. The white people will be ashamed of themselves to-morrow, and\napprehensive of the consequences for some time to come. Keep quiet,\nboys, and trust in God. You won't gain anything by resistance.\"\n\"'God he'ps dem dat he'ps demselves,'\" returned Josh stoutly. \"Ef Mr.\nWatson won't lead us, will you, Dr. Miller?\" said the spokesman, turning\nto the doctor.\nFor Miller it was an agonizing moment. He was no coward, morally or\nphysically. Every manly instinct urged him to go forward and take up the\ncause of these leaderless people, and, if need be, to defend their lives\nand their rights with his own,--but to what end?\n\"Listen, men,\" he said. \"We would only be throwing our lives away.\nSuppose we made a determined stand and won a temporary victory. By\nmorning every train, every boat, every road leading into Wellington,\nwould be crowded with white men,--as they probably will be any\nway,--with arms in their hands, curses on their lips, and vengeance in\ntheir hearts. In the minds of those who make and administer the laws, we\nhave no standing in the court of conscience. They would kill us in the\nfight, or they would hang us afterwards,--one way or another, we should\nbe doomed. I should like to lead you; I should like to arm every colored\nman in this town, and have them stand firmly in line, not for attack,\nbut for defense; but if I attempted it, and they should stand by me,\nwhich is questionable,--for I have met them fleeing from the town,--my\nlife would pay the forfeit. Alive, I may be of some use to you, and you\nare welcome to my life in that way,--I am giving it freely. Dead, I\nshould be a mere lump of carrion. Who remembers even the names of those\nwho have been done to death in the Southern States for the past twenty\nyears?\"\n\"I 'members de name er one of 'em,\" said Josh, \"an' I 'members de name\ner de man dat killt 'im, an' I s'pec' his time is mighty nigh come.\"\n\"My advice is not heroic, but I think it is wise. In this riot we are\nplaced as we should be in a war: we have no territory, no base of\nsupplies, no organization, no outside sympathy,--we stand in the\nposition of a race, in a case like this, without money and without\nfriends. Our time will come,--the time when we can command respect for\nour rights; but it is not yet in sight. Give it up, boys, and wait. Good\nmay come of this, after all.\"\nSeveral of the men wavered, and looked irresolute.\n\"I reckon that's all so, doctuh,\" returned Josh, \"an', de way you put\nit, I don' blame you ner Mr. Watson; but all dem reasons ain' got no\nweight wid me. I'm gwine in dat town, an' ef any w'ite man 'sturbs me,\ndere'll be trouble,--dere'll be double trouble,--I feels it in my\nbones!\"\n\"Remember your old mother, Josh,\" said Miller.",

      "text": "The distance across the city to the home of the Mrs. Butler whom his\nwife had gone to visit was exactly one mile. Though Miller had a good\nhorse in front of him, he was two hours in reaching his destination.\nNever will the picture of that ride fade from his memory. In his dreams\nhe repeats it night after night, and sees the sights that wounded his\neyes, and feels the thoughts--the haunting spirits of the thoughts--that\ntore his heart as he rode through hell to find those whom he was\nseeking. For a short distance he saw nothing, and made rapid progress.\nAs he turned the first corner, his horse shied at the dead body of a\nnegro, lying huddled up in the collapse which marks sudden death. What\nMiller shuddered at was not so much the thought of death, to the sight\nof which his profession had accustomed him, as the suggestion of what it\nsignified. He had taken with allowance the wild statement of the fleeing\nfugitives. Watson, too, had been greatly excited, and Josh Green's group\nwere desperate men, as much liable to be misled by their courage as the\nothers by their fears; but here was proof that murder had been\ndone,--and his wife and children were in the town. Distant shouts, and\nthe sound of firearms, increased his alarm. He struck his horse with the\nwhip, and dashed on toward the heart of the city, which he must traverse\nin order to reach Janet and the child.\nAt the next corner lay the body of another man, with the red blood\noozing from a ghastly wound in the forehead. The negroes seemed to have\nbeen killed, as the band plays in circus parades, at the street\nintersections, where the example would be most effective. Miller, with a\nwild leap of the heart, had barely passed this gruesome spectacle, when\na sharp voice commanded him to halt, and emphasized the order by\ncovering him with a revolver. Forgetting the prudence he had preached to\nothers, he had raised his whip to strike the horse, when several hands\nseized the bridle.\n\"Come down, you damn fool,\" growled an authoritative voice. \"Don't you\nsee we're in earnest? Do you want to get killed?\"\n\"Why should I come down?\" asked Miller. \"Because we've ordered you to\ncome down! This is the white people's day, and when they order, a nigger\nmust obey. We're going to search you for weapons.\"\n\"Search away. You'll find nothing but a case of surgeon's tools, which\nI'm more than likely to need before this day is over, from all\nindications.\"\n\"No matter; we'll make sure of it! That's what we're here for. Come\ndown, if you don't want to be pulled down!\"\nMiller stepped down from his buggy. His interlocutor, who made no effort\nat disguise, was a clerk in a dry-goods store where Miller bought most\nof his family and hospital supplies. He made no sign of recognition,\nhowever, and Miller claimed no acquaintance. This man, who had for\nseveral years emptied Miller's pockets in the course of more or less\nlegitimate trade, now went through them, aided by another man, more\nrapidly than ever before, the searchers convincing themselves that\nMiller carried no deadly weapon upon his person. Meanwhile, a third\nransacked the buggy with like result. Miller recognized several others\nof the party, who made not the slightest attempt at disguise, though no\nnames were called by any one.\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded the leader.\n\"I am looking for my wife and child,\" replied Miller.\n\"Well, run along, and keep them out of the streets when you find them;\nand keep your hands out of this affair, if you wish to live in this\ntown, which from now on will be a white man's town, as you niggers will\nbe pretty firmly convinced before night.\"\nMiller drove on as swiftly as might be. At the next corner he was\nstopped again. In the white man who held him up, Miller recognized a\nneighbor of his own. After a short detention and a perfunctory search,\nthe white man remarked apologetically:--\n\"Sorry to have had to trouble you, doctuh, but them's the o'ders. It\nain't men like you that we're after, but the vicious and criminal class\nof niggers.\"\nMiller smiled bitterly as he urged his horse forward. He was quite well\naware that the virtuous citizen who had stopped him had only a few weeks\nbefore finished a term in the penitentiary, to which he had been\nsentenced for stealing. Miller knew that he could have bought all the\nman owned for fifty dollars, and his soul for as much more.\nA few rods farther on, he came near running over the body of a wounded\nman who lay groaning by the wayside. Every professional instinct urged\nhim to stop and offer aid to the sufferer; but the uncertainty\nconcerning his wife and child proved a stronger motive and urged him\nresistlessly forward. Here and there the ominous sound of firearms was\naudible. He might have thought this merely a part of the show, like the\n\"powder play\" of the Arabs, but for the bloody confirmation of its\nearnestness which had already assailed his vision. Somewhere in this\nseething caldron of unrestrained passions were his wife and child, and\nhe must hurry on.\nHis progress was painfully slow. Three times he was stopped and\nsearched. More than once his way was barred, and he was ordered to turn",

Why tempt the danger?\"\n\"I am looking for my wife and child,\" returned Miller in desperation.\n\"They are somewhere in this town,--I don't know where,--and I must find\nthem.\"\nEllis had been horror-stricken by the tragedy of the afternoon, the\nwholly superfluous slaughter of a harmless people, whom a show of force\nwould have been quite sufficient to overawe. Elaborate explanations were\nafterwards given for these murders, which were said, perhaps truthfully,\nnot to have been premeditated, and many regrets were expressed. The\nyoung man had been surprised, quite as much as the negroes themselves,\nat the ferocity displayed. His own thoughts and feelings were attuned to\nanything but slaughter. Only that morning he had received a perfumed\nnote, calling his attention to what the writer described as a very noble\ndeed of his, and requesting him to call that evening and receive the\nwriter's thanks. Had he known that Miss Pemberton, several weeks after\ntheir visit to the Sound, had driven out again to the hotel and made\nsome inquiries among the servants, he might have understood better the\nmeaning of this missive. When Miller spoke of his wife and child, some\nsubtle thread of suggestion coupled the note with Miller's plight.\n\"I'll go with you, Dr. Miller,\" he said, \"if you'll permit me. In my\ncompany you will not be disturbed.\"\nHe took a seat in Miller's buggy, after which it was not molested.\nNeither of them spoke. Miller was sick at heart; he could have wept with\ngrief, even had the welfare of his own dear ones not been involved in\nthis regrettable affair. With prophetic instinct he foresaw the hatreds\nto which this day would give birth; the long years of constraint and\ndistrust which would still further widen the breach between two peoples\nwhom fate had thrown together in one community.\nThere was nothing for Ellis to say. In his heart he could not defend the\ndeeds of this day. The petty annoyances which the whites had felt at the\nspectacle of a few negroes in office; the not unnatural resentment of a\nproud people at what had seemed to them a presumptuous freedom of speech\nand lack of deference on the part of their inferiors,--these things,\nwhich he knew were to be made the excuse for overturning the city\ngovernment, he realized full well were no sort of justification for the\nwholesale murder or other horrors which might well ensue before the day\nwas done. He could not approve the acts of his own people; neither could\nhe, to a negro, condemn them. Hence he was silent.\n\"Thank you, Mr. Ellis,\" exclaimed Miller, when they had reached the\nhouse where he expected to find his wife. \"This is the place where I was\ngoing. I am--under a great obligation to you.\"",

Why any particular negro was\nassailed, no one stopped to inquire; it was merely a white mob thirsting\nfor black blood, with no more conscience or discrimination than would be\nexercised by a wolf in a sheepfold. It was race against race, the whites\nagainst the negroes; and it was a one-sided affair, for until Josh Green\ngot together his body of armed men, no effective resistance had been\nmade by any colored person, and the individuals who had been killed had\nso far left no marks upon the enemy by which they might be remembered.\n\"Kill the niggers!\" rang out now and then through the dusk, and far down\nthe street and along the intersecting thoroughfares distant voices took\nup the ominous refrain,--\"Kill the niggers! Kill the damned niggers!\"\nNow, not a dark face had been seen on the street for half an hour,\nuntil the group of men headed by Josh made their appearance in the negro\nquarter. Armed with guns and axes, they presented quite a formidable\nappearance as they made their way toward the new hospital, near which\nstood a schoolhouse and a large church, both used by the colored people.\nThey did not reach their destination without having met a number of\nwhite men, singly or in twos or threes; and the rumor spread with\nincredible swiftness that the negroes in turn were up in arms,\ndetermined to massacre all the whites and burn the town. Some of the\nwhites became alarmed, and recognizing the power of the negroes, if\narmed and conscious of their strength, were impressed by the immediate\nnecessity of overpowering and overawing them. Others, with appetites\nalready whetted by slaughter, saw a chance, welcome rather than not, of\nshedding more black blood. Spontaneously the white mob flocked toward\nthe hospital, where rumor had it that a large body of desperate negroes,\nbreathing threats of blood and fire, had taken a determined stand.\nIt had been Josh's plan merely to remain quietly and peaceably in the\nneighborhood of the little group of public institutions, molesting no\none, unless first attacked, and merely letting the white people see that\nthey meant to protect their own; but so rapidly did the rumor spread,\nand so promptly did the white people act, that by the time Josh and his\nsupporters had reached the top of the rising ground where the hospital\nstood, a crowd of white men much more numerous than their own party were\nfollowing them at a short distance.",

Come erlong, boys!\"\nJerry Letlow, who had kept out of sight during the day, had started out,\nafter night had set in, to find Major Carteret. Jerry was very much\nafraid. The events of the day had filled him with terror. Whatever the\nlimitations of Jerry's mind or character may have been, Jerry had a keen\nappreciation of the danger to the negroes when they came in conflict\nwith the whites, and he had no desire to imperil his own skin. He valued\nhis life for his own sake, and not for any altruistic theory that it\nmight be of service to others. In other words, Jerry was something of a\ncoward. He had kept in hiding all day, but finding, toward evening, that\nthe riot did not abate, and fearing, from the rumors which came to his\nears, that all the negroes would be exterminated, he had set out,\nsomewhat desperately, to try to find his white patron and protector. He\nhad been cautious to avoid meeting any white men, and, anticipating no\ndanger from those of his own race, went toward the party which he saw\napproaching, whose path would cross his own. When they were only a few\nyards apart, Josh took a step forward and caught Jerry by the arm.\n\"Come along, Jerry, we need you! Here's another man, boys. Come on now,\nand fight fer yo' race!\"\nIn vain Jerry protested. \"I don' wan' ter fight,\" he howled. \"De w'ite\nfolks ain' gwine ter pester me; dey're my frien's. Tu'n me loose,--tu'n\nme loose, er we all gwine ter git killed!\"\nThe party paid no attention to Jerry's protestations. Indeed, with the\ncrowd of whites following behind, they were simply considering the\nquestion of a position from which they could most effectively defend\nthemselves and the building which they imagined to be threatened. If\nJosh had released his grip of Jerry, that worthy could easily have\nescaped from the crowd; but Josh maintained his hold almost\nmechanically, and, in the confusion, Jerry found himself swept with the\nrest into the hospital, the doors of which were promptly barricaded with\nthe heavier pieces of furniture, and the windows manned by several men\neach, Josh, with the instinct of a born commander, posting his forces so\nthat they could cover with their guns all the approaches to the\nbuilding. Jerry still continuing to make himself troublesome, Josh, in a\nmoment of impatience, gave him a terrific box on the ear, which\nstretched him out upon the floor unconscious.\n\"Shet up,\" he said; \"ef you can't stan' up like a man, keep still, and\ndon't interfere wid men w'at will fight!\" The hospital, when Josh and",

From time immemorial it had been\nbred in the Southern white consciousness, and in the negro consciousness\nalso, for that matter, that the person of a white man was sacred from\nthe touch of a negro, no matter what the provocation. A dozen colored\nmen lay dead in the streets of Wellington, inoffensive people, slain in\ncold blood because they had been bold enough to question the authority\nof those who had assailed them, or frightened enough to flee when they\nhad been ordered to stand still; but their lives counted nothing against\nthat of a riotous white man, who had courted death by attacking a body\nof armed men.\nThe crowd, too, surrounding the hospital, had changed somewhat in\ncharacter. The men who had acted as leaders in the early afternoon,\nhaving accomplished their purpose of overturning the local\nadministration and establishing a provisional government of their own,\nhad withdrawn from active participation in the rioting, deeming the\nnegroes already sufficiently overawed to render unlikely any further\ntrouble from that source. Several of the ringleaders had indeed begun to\nexert themselves to prevent further disorder, or any loss of property,\nthe possibility of which had become apparent; but those who set in\nmotion the forces of evil cannot always control them afterwards. The\nbaser element of the white population, recruited from the wharves and\nthe saloons, was now predominant.\nCaptain McBane was the only one of the revolutionary committee who had\nremained with the mob, not with any purpose to restore or preserve\norder, but because he found the company and the occasion entirely\ncongenial. He had had no opportunity, at least no tenable excuse, to\nkill or maim a negro since the termination of his contract with the\nstate for convicts, and this occasion had awakened a dormant appetite\nfor these diversions. We are all puppets in the hands of Fate, and\nseldom see the strings that move us. McBane had lived a life of violence\nand cruelty. As a man sows, so shall he reap. In works of fiction, such\nmen are sometimes converted. More often, in real life, they do not\nchange their natures until they are converted into dust. One does well\nto distrust a tamed tiger.\nOn the outskirts of the crowd a few of the better class, or at least of\nthe better clad, were looking on. The double volley described had\nalready been fired, when the number of these was augmented by the\narrival of Major Carteret and Mr. Ellis, who had just come from the\nChronicle office, where the next day's paper had been in hasty\npreparation. They pushed their way towards the front of the crowd.\n\"This must be stopped, Ellis,\" said Carteret. \"They are burning houses\nand killing women and children. Old Jane, good old Mammy Jane, who\nnursed my wife at her bosom, and has waited on her and my child within\na few weeks, was killed only a few rods from my house, to which she was\nevidently fleeing for protection. It must have been by accident,--I\ncannot believe that any white man in town would be dastard enough to\ncommit such a deed intentionally! I would have defended her with my own\nlife! We must try to stop this thing!\"\n\"Easier said than done,\" returned Ellis. \"It is in the fever stage, and\nmust burn itself out. We shall be lucky if it does not burn the town\nout. Suppose the negroes should also take a hand at the burning? We have\nadvised the people to put the negroes down, and they are doing the job\nthoroughly.\"\n\"My God!\" replied the other, with a gesture of impatience, as he\ncontinued to elbow his way through the crowd; \"I meant to keep them in\ntheir places,--I did not intend wholesale murder and arson.\"\nCarteret, having reached the front of the mob, made an effort to gain\ntheir attention.\n\"Gentlemen!\" he cried in his loudest tones. His voice, unfortunately,\nwas neither loud nor piercing.\n\"Kill the niggers!\" clamored the mob.\n\"Gentlemen, I implore you\"--\nThe crash of a dozen windows, broken by stones and pistol shots, drowned\nhis voice.\n\"Gentlemen!\" he shouted; \"this is murder, it is madness; it is a\ndisgrace to our city, to our state, to our civilization!\"\n\"That's right!\" replied several voices. The mob had recognized the\nspeaker. \"It _is_ a disgrace, and we'll not put up with it a moment\nlonger. Burn 'em out! Hurrah for Major Carteret, the champion of 'white\nsupremacy'! Three cheers for the Morning Chronicle and 'no nigger\ndomination'!\"\n\"Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!\" yelled the crowd.\nIn vain the baffled orator gesticulated and shrieked in the effort to\ncorrect the misapprehension. Their oracle had spoken; not hearing what\nhe said, they assumed it to mean encouragement and co\u00f6peration. Their\npresent course was but the logical outcome of the crusade which the\nMorning Chronicle had preached, in season and out of season, for many\nmonths. When Carteret had spoken, and the crowd had cheered him, they\nfelt that they had done all that courtesy required, and he was\ngood-naturedly elbowed aside while they proceeded with the work in hand,\nwhich was now to drive out the negroes from the hospital and avenge the\nkilling of their comrade.",

Several safe ways of approach to\nthe building were discovered, and the combustibles placed and fired. The\nflames, soon gaining a foothold, leaped upward, catching here and there\nat the exposed woodwork, and licking the walls hungrily with long\ntongues of flame.\nMeanwhile a desultory firing was kept up from the outside, which was\nreplied to scatteringly from within the hospital. Those inside were\neither not good marksmen, or excitement had spoiled their aim. If a face\nappeared at a window, a dozen pistol shots from the crowd sought the\nspot immediately.\nHigher and higher leaped the flames. Suddenly from one of the windows\nsprang a black figure, waving a white handkerchief. It was Jerry Letlow.\nRegaining consciousness after the effect of Josh's blow had subsided,\nJerry had kept quiet and watched his opportunity. From a safe\nvantage-ground he had scanned the crowd without, in search of some\nwhite friend. When he saw Major Carteret moving disconsolately away\nafter his futile effort to stem the torrent, Jerry made a dash for the\nwindow. He sprang forth, and, waving his handkerchief as a flag of\ntruce, ran toward Major Carteret, shouting frantically:--\n\"Majah Carteret--_O_ majah! It's me, suh, Jerry, suh!

      "text": "\"Let us leave this inferno, Ellis,\" said Carteret, sick with anger and\ndisgust. He had just become aware that a negro was being killed, though\nhe did not know whom. \"We can do nothing. The negroes have themselves to\nblame,--they tempted us beyond endurance. I counseled firmness, and firm\nmeasures were taken, and our purpose was accomplished. I am not\nresponsible for these subsequent horrors,--I wash my hands of them. Let\nus go!\"\nThe flames gained headway and gradually enveloped the burning building,\nuntil it became evident to those within as well as those without that\nthe position of the defenders was no longer tenable. Would they die in\nthe flames, or would they be driven out? The uncertainty soon came to an\nend.\nThe besieged had been willing to fight, so long as there seemed a hope\nof successfully defending themselves and their property; for their\npurpose was purely one of defense. When they saw the case was hopeless,\ninspired by Josh Green's reckless courage, they were still willing to\nsell their lives dearly. One or two of them had already been killed, and\nas many more disabled. The fate of Jerry Letlow had struck terror to the\nhearts of several others, who could scarcely hide their fear. After the\nbuilding had been fired, Josh's exhortations were no longer able to keep\nthem in the hospital. They preferred to fight and be killed in the open,\nrather than to be smothered like rats in a hole.\n\"Boys!\" exclaimed Josh,--\"men!--fer nobody but men would do w'at you\nhave done,--the day has gone 'g'inst us. We kin see ou' finish; but fer\nmy part, I ain' gwine ter leave dis worl' widout takin' a w'ite man\n'long wid me, an' I sees my man right out yonder waitin',--I be'n\nwaitin' fer him twenty years, but he won' have ter wait fer me mo' 'n\n'bout twenty seconds. Eve'y one er you pick yo' man! We'll open de do',\nan' we'll give some w'ite men a chance ter be sorry dey ever started\ndis fuss!\"\nThe door was thrown open suddenly, and through it rushed a dozen or more\nblack figures, armed with knives, pistols, or clubbed muskets. Taken by\nsudden surprise, the white people stood motionless for a moment, but the\napproaching negroes had scarcely covered half the distance to which the\nheat of the flames had driven back the mob, before they were greeted\nwith a volley that laid them all low but two. One of these, dazed by\nthe fate of his companions, turned instinctively to flee, but had\nscarcely faced around before he fell, pierced in the back by a dozen\nbullets.\nJosh Green, the tallest and biggest of them all, had not apparently been\ntouched. Some of the crowd paused in involuntary admiration of this\nblack giant, famed on the wharves for his strength, sweeping down upon\nthem, a smile upon his face, his eyes lit up with a rapt expression\nwhich seemed to take him out of mortal ken. This impression was\nheightened by his apparent immunity from the shower of lead which less\nsusceptible persons had continued to pour at him.\nArmed with a huge bowie-knife, a relic of the civil war, which he had\ncarried on his person for many years for a definite purpose, and which\nhe had kept sharpened to a razor edge, he reached the line of the crowd.\nAll but the bravest shrank back. Like a wedge he dashed through the mob,\nwhich parted instinctively before him, and all oblivious of the rain of\nlead which fell around him, reached the point where Captain McBane, the\nbravest man in the party, stood waiting to meet him. A pistol-flame\nflashed in his face, but he went on, and raising his powerful right arm,\nburied his knife to the hilt in the heart of his enemy. When the crowd\ndashed forward to wreak vengeance on his dead body, they found him with\na smile still upon his face.\nOne of the two died as the fool dieth. Which was it, or was it both?\n\"Vengeance is mine,\" saith the Lord, and it had not been left to Him.\nBut they that do violence must expect to suffer violence. McBane's death\nwas merciful, compared with the nameless horrors he had heaped upon the\nhundreds of helpless mortals who had fallen into his hands during his\ncareer as a contractor of convict labor.\nSobered by this culminating tragedy, the mob shortly afterwards\ndispersed. The flames soon completed their work, and this handsome\nstructure, the fruit of old Adam Miller's industry, the monument of his\nson's philanthropy, a promise of good things for the future of the city,\nlay smouldering in ruins, a melancholy witness to the fact that our\nboasted civilization is but a thin veneer, which cracks and scales off",

Mrs. Albright let her\nwhite nurse come over.\"\n\"I'll go up at once,\" said the major anxiously. \"Wait for me,\nEllis,--I'll be down in a few minutes.\"\n\"Oh, Mr. Ellis,\" exclaimed Clara, coming toward him with both hands\nextended, \"can nothing be done to stop this terrible affair?\"\n\"I wish I could do something,\" he murmured fervently, taking both her\ntrembling hands in his own broad palms, where they rested with a\nsurrendering trustfulness which he has never since had occasion to\ndoubt. \"It has gone too far, already, and the end, I fear, is not yet;\nbut it cannot grow much worse.\" The editor hurried upstairs. Mrs.\nCarteret, wearing a worried and haggard look, met him at the threshold\nof the nursery.\n\"Dodie is ill,\" she said. \"At three o'clock, when the trouble began, I\nwas over at Mrs. Albright's,--I had left Virgie with the baby. When I\ncame back, she and all the other servants had gone. They had heard that\nthe white people were going to kill all the negroes, and fled to seek\nsafety. I found Dodie lying in a draught, before an open window, gasping\nfor breath. I ran back to Mrs. Albright's,--I had found her much better\nto-day,--and she let her nurse come over. The nurse says that Dodie is\nthreatened with membranous croup.\"\n\"Have you sent for Dr. Price?\"\n\"There was no one to send,--the servants were gone, and the nurse was\nafraid to venture out into the street. I telephoned for Dr. Price, and\nfound that he was out of town; that he had gone up the river this\nmorning to attend a patient, and would not be back until to-morrow. Mrs.\nPrice thought that he had anticipated some kind of trouble in the town\nto-day, and had preferred to be where he could not be called upon to\nassume any responsibility.\"\n\"I suppose you tried Dr. Ashe?\"\n\"I could not get him, nor any one else, after that first call. The\ntelephone service is disorganized on account of the riot. We need\nmedicine and ice. The drugstores are all closed on account of the riot,\nand for the same reason we couldn't get any ice.\"\nMajor Carteret stood beside the brass bedstead upon which his child was\nlying,--his only child, around whose curly head clustered all his hopes;\nupon whom all his life for the past year had been centred. He stooped\nover the bed, beside which the nurse had stationed herself. She was\nwiping the child's face, which was red and swollen and covered with\nmoisture, the nostrils working rapidly, and the little patient vainly\nendeavoring at intervals to cough up the obstruction to his breathing.\n\"Is it serious?\" he inquired anxiously. He had always thought of the\ncroup as a childish ailment, that yielded readily to proper treatment;\nbut the child's evident distress impressed him with sudden fear.\n\"Dangerous,\" replied the young woman laconically. \"You came none too\nsoon. If a doctor isn't got at once, the child will die,--and it must\nbe a good doctor.\"\n\"Whom can I call?\" he asked. \"You know them all, I suppose. Dr. Price,\nour family physician, is out of town.\"\n\"Dr. Ashe has charge of his cases when he is away,\" replied the nurse.\n\"If you can't find him, try Dr. Hooper. The child is growing worse every\nminute. On your way back you'd better get some ice, if possible.\"\nThe major hastened downstairs.\n\"Don't wait for me, Ellis,\" he said. \"I shall be needed here for a\nwhile. I'll get to the office as soon as possible. Make up the paper,\nand leave another stick out for me to the last minute, but fill it up in\ncase I'm not on hand by twelve. We must get the paper out early in the\nmorning.\"\nNothing but a matter of the most vital importance would have kept Major\nCarteret away from his office this night. Upon the presentation to the\nouter world of the story of this riot would depend the attitude of the\ngreat civilized public toward the events of the last ten hours. The\nChronicle was the source from which the first word would be expected; it\nwould give the people of Wellington their cue as to the position which\nthey must take in regard to this distressful affair, which had so far\ntranscended in ferocity the most extreme measures which the conspirators\nhad anticipated. The burden of his own responsibility weighed heavily\nupon him, and could not be shaken off; but he must do first the duty\nnearest to him,--he must first attend to his child.",

      "text": "When he reached the child's room, the young doctor was bending anxiously\nover the little frame. The little lips had become livid, the little\nnails, lying against the white sheet, were blue. The child's efforts to\nbreathe were most distressing, and each gasp cut the father like a\nknife. Mrs. Carteret was weeping hysterically. \"How is he, doctor?\"\nasked the major.\n\"He is very low,\" replied the young man. \"Nothing short of\ntracheotomy--an operation to open the windpipe--will relieve him.\nWithout it, in half or three quarters of an hour he will be unable to\nbreathe. It is a delicate operation, a mistake in which would be as\nfatal as the disease. I have neither the knowledge nor the experience to\nattempt it, and your child's life is too valuable for a student to\npractice upon. Neither have I the instruments here.\"\n\"What shall we do?\" demanded Carteret. \"We have called all the best\ndoctors, and none are available.\"\nThe young doctor's brow was wrinkled with thought. He knew a doctor who\ncould perform the operation. He had heard, also, of a certain event at\nCarteret's house some months before, when an unwelcome physician had\nbeen excluded from a consultation,--but it was the last chance.\n\"There is but one other doctor in town who has performed the operation,\nso far as I know,\" he declared, \"and that is Dr. Miller. If you can get\nhim, he can save your child's life.\"\nCarteret hesitated involuntarily. All the incidents, all the arguments,\nof the occasion when he had refused to admit the colored doctor to his\nhouse, came up vividly before his memory. He had acted in accordance\nwith his lifelong beliefs, and had carried his point; but the present\nsituation was different,--this was a case of imperative necessity, and\nevery other interest or consideration must give way before the imminence\nof his child's peril. That the doctor would refuse the call, he did not\nimagine: it would be too great an honor for a negro to decline,--unless\nsome bitterness might have grown out of the proceedings of the\nafternoon. That this doctor was a man of some education he knew; and he\nhad been told that he was a man of fine feeling,--for a negro,--and\nmight easily have taken to heart the day's events. Nevertheless, he\ncould hardly refuse a professional call,--professional ethics would\nrequire him to respond. Carteret had no reason to suppose that Miller\nhad ever learned of what had occurred at the house during Dr. Burns's\nvisit to Wellington. The major himself had never mentioned the\ncontroversy, and no doubt the other gentlemen had been equally silent.\n\"I'll go for him myself,\" said Dr. Evans, noting Carteret's hesitation\nand suspecting its cause. \"I can do nothing here alone, for a little\nwhile, and I may be able to bring the doctor back with me. He likes a\ndifficult operation.\"\n* * * * *\nIt seemed an age ere the young doctor returned, though it was really\nonly a few minutes. The nurse did what she could to relieve the child's\nsufferings, which grew visibly more and more acute. The mother, upon the\nother side of the bed, held one of the baby's hands in her own, and\ncontrolled her feelings as best she might. Carteret paced the floor\nanxiously, going every few seconds to the head of the stairs to listen\nfor Evans's footsteps on the piazza without. At last the welcome sound\nwas audible, and a few strides took him to the door.\n\"Dr. Miller is at home, sir,\" reported Evans, as he came in. \"He says\nthat he was called to your house once before, by a third person who\nclaimed authority to act, and that he was refused admittance. He\ndeclares that he will not consider such a call unless it come from you\npersonally.\"\n\"That is true, quite true,\" replied Carteret. \"His position is a just\none. I will go at once. Will--will--my child live until I can get Miller\nhere?\"\n\"He can live for half an hour without an operation. Beyond that I could\ngive you little hope.\"\nSeizing his hat, Carteret dashed out of the yard and ran rapidly to\nMiller's house; ordinarily a walk of six or seven minutes, Carteret\ncovered it in three, and was almost out of breath when he rang the bell\nof Miller's front door.\nThe ring was answered by the doctor in person.\n\"Dr. Miller, I believe?\" asked Carteret.\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\"I am Major Carteret. My child is seriously ill, and you are the only\navailable doctor who can perform the necessary operation.\"\n\"Ah! You have tried all the others,--and then you come to me!\"\n\"Yes, I do not deny it,\" admitted the major, biting his lip. He had not\ncounted on professional jealousy as an obstacle to be met. \"But I _have_\ncome to you, as a physician, to engage your professional services for my\nchild,--my only child. I have confidence in your skill, or I should not\nhave come to you. I request--nay, I implore you to lose no more time,\nbut come with me at once! My child's life is hanging by a thread, and\nyou can save it!\"\n\"Ah!\" replied the other, \"as a father whose only child's life is in\ndanger, you implore me, of all men in the world, to come and save it!\"\nThere was a strained intensity in the doctor's low voice that struck\nCarteret, in spite of his own pre-occupation. He thought he heard, too,\nfrom the adjoining room, the sound of some one sobbing softly. There was\nsome mystery here which he could not fathom unaided.\nMiller turned to the door behind him and threw it open. On the white\ncover of a low cot lay a childish form in the rigidity of death, and by\nit knelt, with her back to the door, a woman whose shoulders were shaken\nby the violence of her sobs. Absorbed in her grief, she did not turn, or\ngive any sign that she had recognized the intrusion.\n\"There, Major Carteret!\" exclaimed Miller, with the tragic eloquence of\ndespair, \"there lies a specimen of your handiwork! There lies _my_ only\nchild, laid low by a stray bullet in this riot which you and your paper\nhave fomented; struck down as much by your hand as though you had held\nthe weapon with which his life was taken!\"\n\"My God!\" exclaimed Carteret, struck with horror. \"Is the child dead?\"\n\"There he lies,\" continued the other, \"an innocent child,--there he lies\ndead, his little life snuffed out like a candle, because you and a\nhandful of your friends thought you must override the laws and run this\ntown at any cost!--and there kneels his mother, overcome by grief. We\nare alone in the house. It is not safe to leave her unattended. My duty\ncalls me here, by the side of my dead child and my suffering wife! I\ncannot go with you. There is a just God in heaven!--as you have sown, so\nmay you reap!\"\nCarteret possessed a narrow, but a logical mind, and except when\nconfused or blinded by his prejudices, had always tried to be a just\nman. In the agony of his own predicament,--in the horror of the\nsituation at Miller's house,--for a moment the veil of race prejudice\nwas rent in twain, and he saw things as they were, in their correct\nproportions and relations,--saw clearly and convincingly that he had no\nstanding here, in the presence of death, in the home of this stricken\nfamily. Miller's refusal to go with him was pure, elemental justice; he\ncould not blame the doctor for his stand. He was indeed conscious of a\ncertain involuntary admiration for a man who held in his hands the power\nof life and death, and could use it, with strict justice, to avenge his\nown wrongs. In Dr. Miller's place he would have done the same thing.\nMiller had spoken the truth,--as he had sown, so must he reap! He could\nnot expect, could not ask, this father to leave his own household at\nsuch a moment.\nPressing his lips together with grim courage, and bowing mechanically,\nas though to Fate rather than the physician, Carteret turned and left\nthe house. At a rapid pace he soon reached home. There was yet a chance\nfor his child: perhaps some one of the other doctors had come; perhaps,",

Absorbed in his own grief, into which he had relapsed upon\nCarteret's departure, the sound was an unwelcome intrusion. Surely the\nman could not be coming back! If it were some one else--What else might\nhappen to the doomed town concerned him not. His child was dead,--his\ndistracted wife could not be left alone.\nThe doorbell rang--clamorously--appealingly. Through the long hall and\nthe closed door of the room where he sat, he could hear some one\nknocking, and a faint voice calling.\n\"Open, for God's sake, open!\"\nIt was a woman's voice,--the voice of a woman in distress. Slowly Miller\nrose and went to the door, which he opened mechanically.\nA lady stood there, so near the image of his own wife, whom he had just\nleft, that for a moment he was well-nigh startled. A little older,\nperhaps, a little fairer of complexion, but with the same form, the same\nfeatures, marked by the same wild grief. She wore a loose wrapper, which\nclothed her like the drapery of a statue. Her long dark hair, the\ncounterpart of his wife's, had fallen down, and hung disheveled about\nher shoulders. There was blood upon her knuckles, where she had beaten\nwith them upon the door. \"Dr. Miller,\" she panted, breathless from her\nflight and laying her hand upon his arm appealingly,--when he shrank\nfrom the contact she still held it there,--\"Dr. Miller, you will come\nand save my child? You know what it is to lose a child! I am so sorry\nabout your little boy! You will come to mine!\"\n\"Your sorrow comes too late, madam,\" he said harshly. \"My child is dead.\nI charged your husband with his murder, and he could not deny it. Why\nshould I save your husband's child?\"\n\"Ah, Dr. Miller!\" she cried, with his wife's voice,--she never knew how\nmuch, in that dark hour, she owed to that resemblance--\"it is _my_\nchild, and I have never injured you. It is my child, Dr. Miller, my only\nchild. I brought it into the world at the risk of my own life! I have\nnursed it, I have watched over it, I have prayed for it,--and it now\nlies dying! Oh, Dr. Miller, dear Dr. Miller, if you have a heart, come\nand save my child!\"\n\"Madam,\" he answered more gently, moved in spite of himself, \"my heart\nis broken. My people lie dead upon the streets, at the hands of yours.\nThe work of my life is in ashes,--and, yonder, stretched out in death,\nlies my own child! God! woman, you ask too much of human nature! Love,\nduty, sorrow, _justice_, call me here. I cannot go!\"\nShe rose to her full height. \"Then you are a murderer,\" she cried\nwildly. \"His blood be on your head, and a mother's curse beside!\"",

This, then, was the recognition for which, all her life,\nshe had longed in secret. It had come, after many days, and in larger\nmeasure than she had dreamed; but it had come, not with frank kindliness\nand sisterly love, but in a storm of blood and tears; not freely given,\nfrom an open heart, but extorted from a reluctant conscience by the\nagony of a mother's fears. Janet had obtained her heart's desire, and\nnow that it was at her lips, found it but apples of Sodom, filled with\ndust and ashes!\n\"Listen!\" she cried, dashing her tears aside. \"I have but one word for\nyou,--one last word,--and then I hope never to see your face again! My\nmother died of want, and I was brought up by the hand of charity. Now,\nwhen I have married a man who can supply my needs, you offer me back the\nmoney which you and your friends have robbed me of! You imagined that\nthe shame of being a negro swallowed up every other ignominy,--and in\nyour eyes I am a negro, though I am your sister, and you are white, and\npeople have taken me for you on the streets,--and you, therefore, left\nme nameless all my life! Now, when an honest man has given me a name of\nwhich I can be proud, you offer me the one of which you robbed me, and\nof which I can make no use. For twenty-five years I, poor, despicable\nfool, would have kissed your feet for a word, a nod, a smile. Now, when\nthis tardy recognition comes, for which I have waited so long, it is\ntainted with fraud and crime and blood, and I must pay for it with my\nchild's life!\"\n\"And I must forfeit that of mine, it seems, for withholding it so long,\"\nsobbed the other, as, tottering, she turned to go. \"It is but just.\"\n\"Stay--do not go yet!\" commanded Janet imperiously, her pride still\nkeeping back her tears. \"I have not done. I throw you back your\nfather's name, your father's wealth, your sisterly recognition. I want\nnone of them,--they are bought too dear! ah, God, they are bought too\ndear! But that you may know that a woman may be foully wronged, and yet\nmay have a heart to feel, even for one who has injured her, you may have\nyour child's life, if my husband can save it! Will,\" she said, throwing\nopen the door into the next room, \"go with her!\"\n\"God will bless you for a noble woman!\" exclaimed Mrs. Carteret. \"You do\nnot mean all the cruel things you have said,--ah, no! I will see you\nagain, and make you take them back; I cannot thank you now! Oh, doctor,\nlet us go! I pray God we may not be too late!\"\nTogether they went out into the night. Mrs. Carteret tottered under the\nstress of her emotions, and would have fallen, had not Miller caught and\nsustained her with his arm until they reached the house, where he turned\nover her fainting form to Carteret at the door.\n\"Is the child still alive?\" asked Miller.",
