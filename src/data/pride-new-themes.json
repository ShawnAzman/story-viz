A single man of large fortune; four\nor five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.\"\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.\"\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\nI do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\nbeauty.\"\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.\"\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.\"\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the\npreference.\"\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.\"\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.\"\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\nvisit them.\"\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.\"\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.",

She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good will which could not be\noverlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without\nany indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\ntheir two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion\nof her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a\nchange in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such\nits impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means\nunpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she\nesteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",

Its windows\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\nfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\nBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\nenquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.",

No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and\nabsurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that\ncorps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated\nelopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was\npossible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her\nbrother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.\nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.",

But Georgiana would not join\nher. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his\njudgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as\nto leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than\nlovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley\ncould not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to\nhis sister.\n\"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she cried; \"I\nnever in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.\"\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could see\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.\"\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time.\"\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\nwas only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.",

They were off Saturday night about twelve, as\nis conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must\nhave passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason\nto expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,\ninforming her of their intention.

Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\nImprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia\nwould be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for\nthere is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.\nColonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day\nbefore, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to\nGretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief\nthat W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which\nwas repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off\nfrom B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to\nClapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed\ninto a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them\nfrom Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen\nto continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making\nevery possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into\nHertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at\nthe inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such\npeople had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he\ncame on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner\nmost creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and\nMrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my\ndear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,\nbut I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it\nmore eligible for them to be married privately in town than to\npursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design\nagainst a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,\ncan I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to\nfind, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their\nmarriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he\nfeared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill\nand keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but\nthis is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life\nsaw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\nsomething of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock\nis over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so\nselfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I\ntake up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,\nbut circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging\nyou all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and\naunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have\nstill something more to ask of the former. My father is going to\nLondon with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What\nhe means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress\nwill not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest\nway, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again\nto-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and\nassistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was",

            "text": "opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\nmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to\nspeak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\nI must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\ndelayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute,\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\nnot well enough;--you cannot go yourself.\"\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\naccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\nmistress home, instantly.\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take, to give you\npresent relief?--A glass of wine;--shall I get you one?--You are very\nill.\"\n\"No, I thank you;\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well. I am only distressed by\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\nsomething indistinctly of his concern, and observe her in compassionate\nsilence. At length, she spoke again. \"I have just had a letter from\nJane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be concealed from any one. My\nyoungest sister has left all her friends--has eloped;--has thrown\nherself into the power of--of Mr. Wickham. They are gone off together\nfrom Brighton. _You_ know him too well to doubt the rest. She has no\nmoney, no connections, nothing that can tempt him to--she is lost for\never.\"\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment. \"When I consider,\" she added, in a yet\nmore agitated voice, \"that _I_ might have prevented it!--_I_ who knew\nwhat he was. Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what\nI learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\nhave happened. But it is all, all too late now.\"\n\"I am grieved, indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked. But is it\ncertain, absolutely certain?\"\n\"Oh yes!--They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\nalmost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not gone to\nScotland.\"\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\n\"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\nnothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiesence.\n\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character.--Oh! had I known what\nI ought, what I dared, to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\nmuch. Wretched, wretched, mistake!\"\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\nwas sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\nwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\nlong desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my\nstay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any\nthing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer\nconsolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain\nwishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure\nof seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long.\"\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\none serious, parting, look, went away.",

But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\na hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\nof her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\nWickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one\nofficer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\nfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now\nfeel it.\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had\nnever been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\npromised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\nby one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be\ndone about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?\"\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n_That_ is all settled.\"\n\"That is all settled;\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\nprepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\ntruth! Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\nBut wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\nbe written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",

It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should\nform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\nnot adequate to the risk.\"\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle's\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\nhim capable of it?\"\n\"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\nI can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\nhope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?\"\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\nBarnet road.\"\n\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.\"\n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\nmarriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular\nfriend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\nrestraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\ndo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter.\"",

It was a\ncomfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied\nby long expectations.\nThe little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing\non the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the\ncarriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their\nfaces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of\ncapers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.\nElizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss,\nhurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs\nfrom her mother's apartment, immediately met her.\nElizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the\neyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been\nheard of the fugitives.\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jane. \"But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope\nevery thing will be well.\"\n\"Is my father in town?\"\n\"Yes, he went on Tuesday as I wrote you word.\"\n\"And have you heard from him often?\"\n\"We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say\nthat he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I\nparticularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write\nagain, till he had something of importance to mention.\"\n\"And my mother--How is she? How are you all?\"\n\"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly\nshaken. She is up stairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you\nall. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank\nHeaven! are quite well.\"\n\"But you--How are you?\" cried Elizabeth. \"You look pale. How much you\nmust have gone through!\"\nHer sister, however, assured her, of her being perfectly well; and their\nconversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were\nengaged with their children, was now put an end to, by the approach of\nthe whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and\nthanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.\nWhen they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth\nhad already asked, were of course repeated by the others, and they soon\nfound that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,\nhowever, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet\ndeserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that\nevery morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,\nto explain their proceedings, and perhaps announce the marriage.\nMrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes\nconversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with\ntears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villanous\nconduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill usage;\nblaming every body but the person to whose ill judging indulgence the\nerrors of her daughter must be principally owing.",

Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\nside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\nbeen well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\nthe charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor dear\nchild! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\nWickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\nto become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\nwe shall do.\"\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told\nher that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist\nMr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he, \"though it is right to be\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\nmay gain some news of them, and till we know that they are not married,\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\nlost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\ntogether as to what is to be done.\"\n\"Oh! my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\nwherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chuses, to buy them,\nafter they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in,--that I am frightened\nout of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me,\nsuch spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at\nheart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\nLydia, not to give any directions about her clothes, till she has seen\nme, for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,\nhow kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\"\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\nher hopes as her fears; and, after talking with her in this manner till\ndinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\nhousekeeper, who attended, in the absence of her daughters.",

            "text": "In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been\ntoo busily engaged in their separate apartments, to make their\nappearance before. One came from her books, and the other from her\ntoilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change\nwas visible in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or\nthe anger which she had herself incurred in the business, had given\nsomething more of fretfulness than usual, to the accents of Kitty. As\nfor Mary, she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth\nwith a countenance of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at\ntable,\n\"This is a most unfortunate affair; and will probably be much talked of.\nBut we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of\neach other, the balm of sisterly consolation.\"\nThen, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,\n\"Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful\nlesson; that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable--that one false\nstep involves her in endless ruin--that her reputation is no less\nbrittle than it is beautiful,--and that she cannot be too much guarded\nin her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.\"\nElizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to\nmake any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such\nkind of moral extractions from the evil before them.\nIn the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an\nhour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the\nopportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane was equally eager to\nsatisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued\nthe subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and every thing about it, which\nI have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\nespecially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\ngrieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\n\"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\ninclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last\nletter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems,\nof their being in love with each other, many weeks.\"\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\n\"No, I believe not.\"\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\nknow his real character?\"\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in\ndebt; but I hope this may be false.\"\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\nthis could not have happened!\"\n\"Perhaps it would have been better;\" replied her sister. \"But to expose\nthe former faults of any person, without knowing what their present\nfeelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"\n\"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia's note to his\nwife?\"\n\"He brought it with him for us to see.\"\nJane then took it from her pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth. These\nwere the contents:\n\"MY DEAR HARRIET,\n\"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help\nlaughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I am\nmissed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess with\nwho, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man in the\nworld I love, and he is an angel. I should never be happy without\nhim, so think it no harm to be off. You need not send them word at\nLongbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it will make the\nsurprise the greater, when I write to them, and sign my name Lydia\nWickham. What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for\nlaughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my\nengagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will\nexcuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\nthe next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my\nclothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally\nto mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are\npacked up. Good bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you\nwill drink to our good journey.\n\"Your affectionate friend,\n\"LYDIA BENNET.\"\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she had\nfinished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment. But\nat least it shews, that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.\nWhatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a\n_scheme_ of infamy. My poor father! how he must have felt it!\"\n\"I never saw any one so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten\nminutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the whole house in\nsuch confusion!\"\n\"Oh! Jane,\" cried Elizabeth, \"was there a servant belonging to it, who\ndid not know the whole story before the end of the day?\"\n\"I do not know.--I hope there was.--But to be guarded at such a time, is\nvery difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I endeavoured to\ngive her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much\nas I might have done! But the horror of what might possibly happen,\nalmost took from me my faculties.\"\n\"Your attendance upon her, has been too much for you. You do not look\nwell. Oh! that I had been with you, you have had every care and anxiety\nupon yourself alone.\"\n\"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every\nfatigue, I am sure, but I did not think it right for either of them.\nKitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much, that her hours\nof repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn\non Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till\nThursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and lady\nLucas has been very kind; she walked here on Wednesday morning to\ncondole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if\nthey could be of use to us.\"\n\"She had better have stayed at home,\" cried Elizabeth; \"perhaps she\n_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too\nlittle of one's neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,\ninsufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.\"\nShe then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her father had\nintended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.\n\"He meant, I believe,\" replied Jane, \"to go to Epsom, the place where\nthey last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if any thing could\nbe made out from them. His principal object must be, to discover the\nnumber of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be\nremarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\ndetermined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible",

It was as\nfollows:\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\nin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\nfrom Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and\nmyself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable\nfamily, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\nkind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\narguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\na misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\nmust be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death\nof your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.\nAnd it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\nsuppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\nof behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree\nof indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of\nyourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own\ndisposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of\nsuch an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you\nare grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined\nby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,\nto whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in\napprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\nwith such a family. And this consideration leads me moreover to\nreflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last\nNovember, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in\nall your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,\nto console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy\nchild from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the\nfruits of her own heinous offence.\n\"I am, dear Sir, &c. &c.\"",

They are not married,\nnor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are\nwilling to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\nequal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your\nlife, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions, which,\nconsidering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as\nfar as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\nexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\nwill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's\ncircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\nbe. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\nsay, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are\ndischarged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\nIf, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\nin your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will\nimmediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\nsettlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming\nto town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on\nmy diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,\nand be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best, that my\nniece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\napprove. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as any\nthing more is determined on. Your's, &c.\n\"EDW. GARDINER.\"",

It is useless to talk of it.\"\nIt now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood\nperfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,\ntherefore, and asked their father, whether he would not wish them to\nmake it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head,\ncoolly replied,\n\"Just as you please.\"\n\"May we take my uncle's letter to read to her?\"\n\"Take whatever you like, and get away.\"\nElizabeth took the letter from his writing table, and they went up\nstairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one\ncommunication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation\nfor good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly\ncontain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's\nbeing soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence\nadded to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know\nthat her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no\nfear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried: \"This is delightful indeed!--She will\nbe married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My\ngood, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\nevery thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\nmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\nLydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\nGardiner's behaviour laid them all under.\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great\nmeasure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself\nto assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\nmust have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have\never had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\nIn a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\nit sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you\nwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the money\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\nLady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\nairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any\nthing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\nall have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.\"\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\nPoor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no\nworse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in\nlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,\ncould be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they\nhad feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they",

He has the\npromise of an ensigncy in General ----'s regiment, now quartered in\nthe North. It is an advantage to have it so far from this part of\nthe kingdom. He promises fairly, and I hope among different people,\nwhere they may each have a character to preserve, they will both be\nmore prudent. I have written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of\nour present arrangements, and to request that he will satisfy the\nvarious creditors of Mr. Wickham in and near Brighton, with\nassurances of speedy payment, for which I have pledged myself. And\nwill you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances\nto his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list,\naccording to his information. He has given in all his debts; I hope\nat least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and\nall will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,\nunless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from\nMrs. Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all,\nbefore she leaves the South. She is well, and begs to be dutifully\nremembered to you and her mother.--Your's, &c.",

Elizabeth had\nnot before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat down,\nresolving within herself, to draw no limits in future to the impudence\nof an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of\nthe two who caused their confusion, suffered no variation of colour.\nThere was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\nElizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\nwith a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\nvoluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for\nthe world.\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away;\nit seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\nenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the\npeople here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might\nnot; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was\ndetermined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to\nhim, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window\nframe, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\nany thing.\"\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\nthe dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to\nher eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\nlower, because I am a married woman.\"\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\ntheir other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham,\" by\neach of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her\nring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.",

I\nam sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they may have half my\ngood luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the place to get\nhusbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go.\"\n\"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I don't\nat all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?\"\n\"Oh, lord! yes;--there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all\nthings. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We\nshall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some\nballs, and I will take care to get good partners for them all.\"\n\"I should like it beyond any thing!\" said her mother.\n\"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters\nbehind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the\nwinter is over.\"\n\"I thank you for my share of the favour,\" said Elizabeth; \"but I do not\nparticularly like your way of getting husbands.\"\nTheir visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham\nhad received his commission before he left London, and he was to join\nhis regiment at the end of a fortnight.\nNo one but Mrs. Bennet, regretted that their stay would be so short; and\nshe made the most of the time, by visiting about with her daughter, and\nhaving very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to\nall; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did\nthink, than such as did not.\nWickham's affection for Lydia, was just what Elizabeth had expected to\nfind it; not equal to Lydia's for him. She had scarcely needed her\npresent observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that\ntheir elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love, rather\nthan by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring\nfor her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain\nthat his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and\nif that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity\nof having a companion.\nLydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every\noccasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did every\nthing best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds on\nthe first of September, than any body else in the country.\nOne morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two\nelder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,\n\"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were\nnot by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\ncurious to hear how it was managed?\"\n\"No really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little said\non the subject.\"\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\no'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\nwere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\nsuch a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my\naunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if\nshe was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten,\nfor I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to\nknow whether he would be married in his blue coat.\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was\nrather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just\nas the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business\nto that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get\ntogether, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not\nknow what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond\nthe hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back\nagain in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I\nrecollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the\nwedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"",

She was no sooner in possession of it, than\nhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\ncontain a denial.\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\n\"MY DEAR NIECE,\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\nnot comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\nsurprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\nDon't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\nthat I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_\nside. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\nimpertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing\nbut the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed\nhim to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\nignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\nhome from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\nDarcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\nover before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\nas _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that\nhe had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that\nhe had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia\nonce. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\nafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting\nfor them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being\nowing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well\nknown, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,\nto love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his\nmistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath\nhim, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character\nwas to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\nforward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on\nby himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\ndisgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to\ndiscover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\nmore than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another\nreason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\ndismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\nhe did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,\nand has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\nYounge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\nwent to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\nit was two or three days before he could get from her what he\nwanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\nand corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\nfound. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in\nLondon, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\nwould have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\nstreet. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\nHis first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\nher to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\nfriends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\noffering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\nabsolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\nof her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of\nleaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\nother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\nfeelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\nmarriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\neasily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\nobliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,\nwhich were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the\nill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone. He\nmeant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future\nsituation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go\nsomewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\nnothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\nsister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,\nhe would have been able to do something for him, and his situation\nmust have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to\nthis question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\neffectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.\nUnder such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\nagainst the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,\nfor there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more\nthan he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\nEvery thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was\nto make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\nGracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner\ncould not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that\nyour father was still with him, but would quit town the next\nmorning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could\nso properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\nseeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not\nleave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a\ngentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your\nfather was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they\nhad a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and\nthen _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon\nas it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor\nwas very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real\ndefect of his character after all. He has been accused of many\nfaults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was\nto be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do\nnot speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your\nuncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman\nor lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced\nto yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,\nwas forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\nwhich went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your\nletter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an\nexplanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give\nthe praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther\nthan yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,\nwhat has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,\namounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,\nanother thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\ncommission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\nalone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\nreserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character\nhad been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\nreceived and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_\nreserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\nfine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that\nyour uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\nfor _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\non, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\nPemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\nwhen the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\nreceive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.\nIt is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\nhope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\nus; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\nexactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\nwould not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\nwhile she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter\nlast Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\npiece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no\nfresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and\nall the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,\nit was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\nsometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth\nand Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was\npunctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the\nwedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again\non Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\nLizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\nenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\nin every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\nHis understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\na little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\nwife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever\nmentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\nme, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\nfar, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\nhave been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\npair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more.\nThe children have been wanting me this half hour. Your's, very\nsincerely,\n\"M. GARDINER.\"",

Are the others coming out?\"\n\"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to\nMeryton. And so, my dear sister, I find from our uncle and aunt, that\nyou have actually seen Pemberley.\"\nShe replied in the affirmative.\n\"I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much\nfor me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the\nold housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of\nme. But of course she did not mention my name to you.\"\n\"Yes, she did.\"\n\"And what did she say?\"\n\"That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned\nout well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely\nmisrepresented.\"\n\"Certainly,\" he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had\nsilenced him; but he soon afterwards said,\n\"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other\nseveral times. I wonder what he can be doing there.\"\n\"Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,\" said\nElizabeth. \"It must be something particular, to take him there at this\ntime of year.\"\n\"Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I\nunderstood from the Gardiners that you had.\"\n\"Yes; he introduced us to his sister.\"\n\"And do you like her?\"\n\"Very much.\"\n\"I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year\nor two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad\nyou liked her. I hope she will turn out well.\"\n\"I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.\"\n\"Did you go by the village of Kympton?\"\n\"I do not recollect that we did.\"\n\"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have had. A\nmost delightful place!--Excellent Parsonage House! It would have suited\nme in every respect.\"\n\"How should you have liked making sermons?\"\n\"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and\nthe exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to\nrepine;--but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The\nquiet, the retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas\nof happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the\ncircumstance, when you were in Kent?\"\n\"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was\nleft you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.\"\n\"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\nfirst, you may remember.\"\n\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.\"\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember\nwhat I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.\"\nThey were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast\nto get rid of him; and unwilling for her sister's sake, to provoke him,\nshe only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,\n\"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us\nquarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one\nmind.\"\nShe held out her hand; he kissed it with affectionate gallantry, though\nhe hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.",

It was many months since she had mentioned his name to\nElizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,\n\"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present\nreport; and I know I appeared distressed. But don't imagine it was from\nany silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt\nthat I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you, that the news does not\naffect me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he\ncomes alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid\nof _myself_, but I dread other people's remarks.\"\nElizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in\nDerbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there, with no\nother view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial\nto Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming\nthere _with_ his friend's permission, or being bold enough to come\nwithout it.\n\"Yet it is hard,\" she sometimes thought, \"that this poor man cannot come\nto a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this\nspeculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.\"\nIn spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her\nfeelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily\nperceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,\nmore unequal, than she had often seen them.\nThe subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,\nabout a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.\n\"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"you\nwill wait on him of course.\"\n\"No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised if I\nwent to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in\nnothing, and I will not be sent on a fool's errand again.\"\nHis wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention\nwould be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to\nNetherfield.\n\"'Tis an etiquette I despise,\" said he. \"If he wants our society, let\nhim seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in\nrunning after my neighbours every time they go away, and come back\nagain.\"\n\"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not\nwait on him. But, however, that shan't prevent my asking him to dine\nhere, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon.\nThat will make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at\ntable for him.\"\nConsoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her\nhusband's incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her\nneighbours might all see Mr. Bingley in consequence of it, before _they_\ndid. As the day of his arrival drew near,\n\"I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,\" said Jane to her sister. \"It\nwould be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference, but I can\nhardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;\nbut she does not know, no one can know how much I suffer from what she\nsays. Happy shall I be, when his stay at Netherfield is over!\"",

Jane resolutely\nkept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went\nto the window--she looked,--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down\nagain by her sister.\n\"There is a gentleman with him, mamma,\" said Kitty; \"who can it be?\"\n\"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not\nknow.\"\n\"La!\" replied Kitty, \"it looks just like that man that used to be with\nhim before. Mr. what's his name. That tall, proud man.\"\n\"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!--and so it does I vow. Well, any friend of\nMr. Bingley's will always be welcome here to be sure; but else I must\nsay that I hate the very sight of him.\"\nJane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She knew but little\nof their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the awkwardness\nwhich must attend her sister, in seeing him almost for the first time\nafter receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable\nenough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their\nmother talked on, of her dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her resolution to be\ncivil to him only as Mr. Bingley's friend, without being heard by either\nof them. But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be\nsuspected by Jane, to whom she had never yet had courage to shew Mrs.\nGardiner's letter, or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him.\nTo Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and\nwhose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and\nwishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\nenough for expectation.\"\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\nsister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\ngentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\npresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\nnot an improbable, conjecture.\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\nBennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher curtsey and address to his friend.",

There he had talked to her\nfriends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed,\nwithout bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she\nas often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no\nobject but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please\nthan when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed,\nand angry with herself for being so.\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\nHe readily agreed to it.\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\nGeorge Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.\nIt was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\nmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\ncontinued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\nNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to\nstay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you\nhave heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\nregulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\nmany as he deserves.\"\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\ndone before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in\nthe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\n\"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.\nBennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the covies for you.\"\nElizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for\nmoments of such painful confusion.\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to be\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure,\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\none or the other again!\"",

I have not forgot, you see; and I assure\nyou, I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep\nyour engagement.\"\nBingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of\nhis concern, at having been prevented by business. They then went away.\nMrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine\nthere, that day; but, though she always kept a very good table, she did\nnot think any thing less than two courses, could be good enough for a\nman, on whom she had such anxious designs, or satisfy the appetite and\npride of one who had ten thousand a-year.",

I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\nI assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\na haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\nwhat do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\nat Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\na creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\nand not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\nBingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.\n\"It has been a very agreeable day,\" said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth. \"The\nparty seemed so well selected, so suitable one with the other. I hope we\nmay often meet again.\"\nElizabeth smiled.\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish beyond it. I am\nperfectly satisfied from what his manners now are, that he never had any\ndesign of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing than any other man.\"\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and\nare provoking me to it every moment.\"\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!\"\n\"And how impossible in others!\"\n\"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?\"\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer.

He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, &c. &c.; and if she would\ngive him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on them.\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\naccepted with alacrity.\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\ndressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing\ngown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\ncome.--He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\nLizzy's hair.\"\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is\nforwarder than either of us, for she went up stairs half an hour ago.\"\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come be quick, be quick!\nwhere is your sash my dear?\"\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves, was visible again in the\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\ncustom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter mamma? What do\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\n\"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still five\nminutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,\n\"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth, which spoke her distress at\nsuch premeditation, and her intreaty that _she_ would not give into it.\nIn a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\nElizabeth was forced to go.\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;\" said her mother as\nsoon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\nmy dressing-room.\"\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall, till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.\nMrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every\nthing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His\nease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their\nevening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the\nmother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command\nof countenance, particularly grateful to the daughter.\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went\naway, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs.\nBennet's means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\nthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's",

The latter was much more\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\nor folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him\ninto silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\nevery body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\nto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\nfor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\nwanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\nsaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\nhad been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\nsister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\nboth as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would\nhave told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she\nthought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\nElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\nwell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\npleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n\"'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\nwhy is not every body as happy?\"\nElizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\nfrom any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"\nShe then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the\ncard party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.\nElizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease\nwith which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many\nprevious months of suspense and vexation.\n\"And this,\" said she, \"is the end of all his friend's anxious\ncircumspection! of all his sister's falsehood and contrivance! the\nhappiest, wisest, most reasonable end!\"\nIn a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her\nfather had been short and to the purpose.\n\"Where is your sister?\" said he hastily, as he opened the door.\n\"With my mother up stairs. She will be down in a moment I dare say.\"\nHe then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and\naffection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\ngreat cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen\nto all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\nexpectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for\nbasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\nhimself.\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed\nhow really happy he was.\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he",

I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\nthat you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\never was seen!\"\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\nfavourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\nhimself obliged to accept.\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present, Jane had no attention to bestow on any one else;\nbut she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those\nhours of separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane,\nhe always attached himself to Elizabeth, for the pleasure of talking of\nher; and when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of\nrelief.\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me, that\nhe was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not\nbelieved it possible.\"\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\nit?\"\n\"It must have been his sister's doing. They were certainly no friends to\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again; though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.\"\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November,\nhe really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being\nindifferent, would have prevented his coming down again!\"\n\"He made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\nmodesty.\"\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities.\nElizabeth was pleased to find, that he had not betrayed the interference\nof his friend, for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\nher against him.\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried\nJane. \"Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\nabove them all! If I could but see _you_ as happy! If there _were_ but\nsuch another man for you!\"\n\"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy as\nyou. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\n_she_ ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.",

            "text": "One morning, about a week after Bingley's engagement with Jane had been\nformed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the\ndining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window, by the\nsound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the\nlawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors, and besides, the\nequipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses\nwere post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who\npreceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that\nsomebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid\nthe confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the\nshrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of the remaining three\ncontinued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown\nopen, and their visitor entered. It was lady Catherine de Bourgh.\nThey were of course all intending to be surprised; but their\nastonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.\nBennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even\ninferior to what Elizabeth felt.\nShe entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no\nother reply to Elizabeth's salutation, than a slight inclination of the\nhead, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her\nname to her mother, on her ladyship's entrance, though no request of\nintroduction had been made.\nMrs. Bennet all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\nfor a moment in silence, she said very stiffly to Elizabeth,\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady I suppose is your mother.\"\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n\"And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters.\"\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a lady Catherine.\n\"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all, is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,\nwho I believe will soon become a part of the family.\"\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short\nsilence.\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\nassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.\"\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\nsummer; the windows are full west.\"\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\nadded,\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\nMrs. Collins well.\"\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her ladyship to take some\nrefreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\ndeclined eating any thing; and then rising up, said to Elizabeth,\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.\"\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about the\ndifferent walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.\"\nElizabeth obeyed, and running into her own room for her parasol,\nattended her noble guest down stairs. As they passed through the hall,\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\nlooking rooms, walked on.\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk\nthat led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for\nconversation with a woman, who was now more than usually insolent and\ndisagreeable.\n\"How could I ever think her like her nephew?\" said she, as she looked in\nher face.\nAs soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following\nmanner:--\n\"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my\njourney hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\ncome.\"\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to account\nfor the honour of seeing you here.\"\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\nknow, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\nalarming nature, reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n_you_, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet, would, in all likelihood, be soon\nafterwards united to my nephew, my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood; though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.\"\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far. What could your ladyship propose by it?\"\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth,\ncoolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.\"\n\"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?\"\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?\"\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. _You_\nmay ask questions, which _I_ shall not choose to answer.\"\n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\n\"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\nmay have drawn him in.\"\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\n\"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\nthis, ever induce me to be explicit.\"\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?\"\n\"Only this; that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\nmake an offer to me.\"\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\n_his_ mother, as well as of her's. While in their cradles, we planned\nthe union: and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would\nbe accomplished, in their marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\nthe family! Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends? To his\ntacit engagement with Miss De Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\nearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\n\"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\nother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\nkept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\nMiss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it. Yes, Miss\nBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by every one connected with him.\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\nby any of us.\"\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr.\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\nto repine.\"\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\nscore?\n\"Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came here\nwith the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I be\ndissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's whims.\nI have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\n\"_That_ will make your ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;\nbut it will have no effect on _me_.\"\n\"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended on the maternal\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\nhonourable, and ancient, though untitled families. Their fortune on both\nsides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide them? The\nupstart pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or\nfortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If you\nwere sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit the sphere,\nin which you have been brought up.\"\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\nequal.\"\n\"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But who was your mother? Who\nare your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\ncondition.\"\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\"\n\"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question; she could not but say, after a\nmoment's deliberation,\n\"I am not.\"\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\n\"And will you promise me, never to enter into such an engagement?\"\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\n\"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\nwill ever recede. I shall not go away, till you have given me the\nassurance I require.\"\n\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise, make\n_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\nme, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand, make him wish to bestow it\non his cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\nwhich you have supported this extraordinary application, have been as\nfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\nI cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\nmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no farther on the\nsubject.\"\n\"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the\nobjections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I am no\nstranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous\nelopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a\npatched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is\n_such_ a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is _her_ husband, is the son of\nhis late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!--of what\nare you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\"\n\"You can _now_ have nothing farther to say,\" she resentfully answered.\n\"You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to\nthe house.\"\nAnd she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned\nback. Her ladyship was highly incensed.\n\"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my nephew!\nUnfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you,\nmust disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?\"\n\"Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments.\"\n\"You are then resolved to have him?\"\n\"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that manner,\nwhich will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness, without\nreference to _you_, or to any person so wholly unconnected with me.\"\n\"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the\nclaims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to ruin him in\nthe opinion of all his friends, and make him the contempt of the world.\"\n\"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,\" replied Elizabeth, \"have any\npossible claim on me, in the present instance. No principle of either,\nwould be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the\nresentment of his family, or the indignation of the world, if the former\n_were_ excited by his marrying me, it would not give me one moment's\nconcern--and the world in general would have too much sense to join in\nthe scorn.\"\n\"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very well. I\nshall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet, that your\nambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I hoped to find you\nreasonable; but depend upon it I will carry my point.\"\nIn this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the door of\nthe carriage, when turning hastily round, she added,\n\"I take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your\nmother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously displeased.\"\nElizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her\nladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it herself. She\nheard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs. Her mother\nimpatiently met her at the door of the dressing-room, to ask why Lady\nCatherine would not come in again and rest herself.\n\"She did not choose it,\" said her daughter, \"she would go.\"\n\"She is a very fine-looking woman! and her calling here was prodigiously\ncivil! for she only came, I suppose, to tell us the Collinses were well.\nShe is on her road somewhere, I dare say, and so passing through\nMeryton, thought she might as well call on you. I suppose she had",

Lady Catherine it\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\nLucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only\nset _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked\nforward to as possible, at some future time.\nIn revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\nan application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise, should come to\nhis friend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to\nunderstand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of\nhis constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\nat all.\"",

It suddenly struck her that it might\nbe from lady Catherine; and she anticipated with dismay all the\nconsequent explanations.\nShe followed her father to the fire place, and they both sat down. He\nthen said,\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\ncontents. I did not know before, that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you, on a very important conquest.\"\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\nherself; when her father continued,\n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to discover the\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\"\n\"Something very much to the purpose of course. He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says\non that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. \"Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\nher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,\nmay be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious\npersonages in this land.\"\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\" \"This young\ngentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\nmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\npatronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\nElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate\nclosure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out.\"\n\"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine\nthat his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\na friendly eye.\"\n\"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\nhis life! It is admirable!\"\nElizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\nlittle agreeable to her.\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\nfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\nto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\nher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\" \"Mr.\nCollins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\nliving together before the marriage took place, should be so generally\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\na christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names\nto be mentioned in your hearing.\" \"_That_ is his notion of christian\nforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's\nsituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\nlook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I\nhope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\nlive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\nturn?\"\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so\nstrange!\"\n\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\nrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of",

I\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\nsister. Ever since I have known it, I have been most anxious to\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\nof my family, I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\nand emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs.\nGardiner was so little to be trusted.\"\n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\nsake of discovering them.\"\n\"If you _will_ thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone.\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you, might add force to the other\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\n_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe, I thought\nonly of _you_.\"\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\nher companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\naffections and wishes are unchanged, but one word from you will silence\nme on this subject for ever.\"\nElizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\nvery fluently, gave him to understand, that her sentiments had undergone\nso material a change, since the period to which he alluded, as to make\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure, his present assurances. The\nhappiness which this reply produced, was such as he had probably never\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\nbeen able to encounter his eye, she might have seen how well the\nexpression of heart-felt delight, diffused over his face, became him;\nbut, though she could not look, she could listen, and he told her of\nfeelings, which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his\naffection every moment more valuable.\nThey walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\nbe thought; and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding",

But, unluckily for her\nladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that,\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine, frankly and openly.\"\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough of\nmy _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\nyour relations.\"\n\"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\nto you at the time, had merited the severest reproof. It was\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\nevening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly examined,\nwill be irreproachable; but since then, we have both, I hope, improved\nin civility.\"\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a\nmore gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you\ncan scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some\ntime, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\na way.\"\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway, that would induce you to accept me.\"\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\nall. I assure you, that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he, \"did it _soon_ make you\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\ncontents?\"\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her\nformer prejudices had been removed.\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part\nespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\npower of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might\njustly make you hate me.\"\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\nchanged as that implies.\"\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly\ncalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so\nwidely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\ncircumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\nof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\npleasure.\"",

I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\nwhich I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\nhim.\"\n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\nhis reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\none thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\nin any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\nnow.\"\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it\nwas rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,\nwhich of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\nconversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.",

This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\nyou shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and\nI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am\nin earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are\nengaged.\"\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\nyou dislike him.\"\n\"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\ndid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these,\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\nremember it myself.\"\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\nseriously assured her of its truth.\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\" cried\nJane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you\ncertain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\nhappy with him?\"\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,\nJane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\nto do?\"\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I\ntell you all.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\nafraid you will be angry.\"\n\"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious. I want to talk very seriously.\nLet me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell\nme how long you have loved him?\"\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\nBut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\nat Pemberley.\"\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\nfarther to wish.\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself. I\nalways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\nof it, to another, not to you.\"\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer\nconceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,\nand half the night spent in conversation.",

She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he\nwants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of\nher attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n\"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\nBut will they make you happy?\"\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my\nindifference?\"\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him.\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.\"\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\nabout.\"\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\nand at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\nmonths suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she\ndid conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\nyou, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\nand economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\nMr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"",

Every thing was too recent for\ngaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer any\nthing material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity\nwould come in time.\nWhen her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,\nand made the important communication. Its effect was most\nextraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and\nunable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that\nshe could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to\ncredit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the\nshape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless\nherself.\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\nhave thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\nyou will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my\ndear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\nLord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\"\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else! Ten\nthousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a\nspecial licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But\nmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,\nthat I may have it to-morrow.\"\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\nevery hour in his esteem.\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he. \"Wickham, perhaps,\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\nas Jane's.\"",

But I wonder how long you\n_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when\nyou _would_ have spoken, if I had not asked you!

I am not indebted for my present happiness to\nyour eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to\nwait for any opening of your's. My aunt's intelligence had given me\nhope, and I was determined at once to know every thing.\"\n\"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,\nfor she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to\nNetherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?\nor had you intended any more serious consequence?\"\n\"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I\nmight ever hope to make you love me.

Elizabeth will\nsoon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\nyou can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\nmore to give.\n\"Your's sincerely, &c.\"\nMiss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\nmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even\nto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her\nformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was\naffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\nher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was\nas sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\nto Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden\nremoval was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\nmeeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\nMrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good\nhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.\nNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\nlikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him\nto herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\nwithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\nfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\nadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\nthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to\neither, to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at\nPemberley.",

Their manner of living, even when the\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\nextreme.

They were able to love each\nother, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion\nin the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an\nastonishment bordering on alarm, at her lively, sportive, manner of\ntalking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect\nwhich almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open\npleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in\nher way. By Elizabeth's instructions she began to comprehend that a\nwoman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not\nalways allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.\nLady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;\nand as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in\nher reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him\nlanguage so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time\nall intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth's persuasion,\nhe was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;\nand, after a little farther resistance on the part of his aunt, her\nresentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity\nto see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on\nthem at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had\nreceived, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the\nvisits of her uncle and aunt from the city.\nWith the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,\nas well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever\nsensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing\nher into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.",

Mr. Collins\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe\nit, and could not help saying so.\n\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\na very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\nI will _make_ her know it.\"\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if she\nis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\nforce her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as\ngood natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out as she entered the library,\n\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\nnot have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have _her_.\"\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\nher communication.\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\nfinished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business.\"\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\nmarrying him.\"\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\nlibrary.\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was.\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\n\"I have, Sir.\"\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\naccepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\nbe a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\nif you _do_.\"\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.",

The envelope contained a\nsheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\nJane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to\njoin with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they\nhad gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a\ngood deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are\non their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.\nYou shall hear what she says.\"\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to\nregret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\nwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high\nflown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as",

            "text": "to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\nintercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.\"\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you--\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of\nwhom we shall deprive you.\"\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\nwinter.\"\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.\"\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\" \"Mr. Darcy\nis impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are\nscarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana\nDarcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the\naffection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?\"\n\"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"--said Jane as she\nfinished it. \"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\nis perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\nput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?\"\n\"Most willingly.\"\n\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.\"\nJane shook her head.\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you\ntogether, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is\nnot such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy\nfor herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is\nthis. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\nmore anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\nwhen there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\nachieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\nbeing in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\nrepresentation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\none; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.\"\n\"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?\"\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\nall means to refuse him.\"\n\"How can you talk so?\"--said Jane faintly smiling,--\"You must know that\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\nnot hesitate.\"\n\"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\nyour situation with much compassion.\"\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of every one.\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\nJane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\nlamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\nthat Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\nand the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\nhe had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\ntwo full courses.",

But still he would be her husband.--Without thinking highly\neither of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it\nwas the only honourable provision for well-educated young women of small\nfortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their\npleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she had now\nobtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been\nhandsome, she felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable\ncircumstance in the business, was the surprise it must occasion to\nElizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other\nperson.

She resolved to give her the information herself, and\ntherefore charged Mr. Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner,\nto drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family. A promise\nof secrecy was of course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept\nwithout difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his long absence, burst\nforth in such very direct questions on his return, as required some\ningenuity to evade, and he was at the same time exercising great\nself-denial, for he was longing to publish his prosperous love.",

Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from\npossibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the\nbounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!\"\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon\nregained her composure, and calmly replied,\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect\nof their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished\nher all imaginable happiness.\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte,--\"you must be\nsurprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to\nmarry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you\nwill be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I\nnever was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state.\"\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\"--and after an awkward pause,\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\nof marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being\nnow accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony\nwas not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it\npossible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every\nbetter feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,\nwas a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot",

Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day.

As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.\n\"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,\" said she, \"it is very hard to think that Charlotte\nLucas should ever be mistress of this house, that I should be forced to\nmake way for _her_, and live to see her take my place in it!\"\n\"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope for\nbetter things.

If it was\nnot for the entail I should not mind it.\"\n\"What should not you mind?\"\n\"I should not mind any thing at all.\"\n\"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such\ninsensibility.\"\n\"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for any thing about the entail.",
