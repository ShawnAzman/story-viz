            "text": "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\nof a good fortune must be in want of a wife.\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\nNetherfield Park is let at last?\"\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.\"\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\n\"Do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife, impatiently.\n\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\n[Illustration:\n\"He came down to see the place\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\nThis was invitation enough.\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.\"\n\"What is his name?\"\n\"Bingley.\"\n\"Is he married or single?\"\n\"Oh, single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or\nfive thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome? You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\"Design? Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.\"\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go--or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better; for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.\"\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\nI do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five\ngrown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.\"\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account; for in general, you know, they visit no new\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.\"\n\"You are over scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls--though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers: and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood-humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the preference.\"\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he: \"they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.\"\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.\"\n\"Ah, you do not know what I suffer.\"\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you will not\nvisit them.\"\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.\"\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented, she\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married: its solace was visiting and news.\n[Illustration: M^{r.} & M^{rs.} Bennet",

He\nhad always intended to visit him, though to the last always assuring his\nwife that he should not go; and till the evening after the visit was\npaid she had no knowledge of it. It was then disclosed in the following\nmanner. Observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat, he\nsuddenly addressed her with,--\n\"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy.\"\n\"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,\" said her mother,\nresentfully, \"since we are not to visit.\"\n\"But you forget, mamma,\" said Elizabeth, \"that we shall meet him at the\nassemblies, and that Mrs. Long has promised to introduce him.\"\n\"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She has two nieces\nof her own. She is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I have no opinion\nof her.\"\n\"No more have I,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and I am glad to find that you do\nnot depend on her serving you.\"\nMrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply; but, unable to contain\nherself, began scolding one of her daughters.\n\"Don't keep coughing so, Kitty, for heaven's sake! Have a little\ncompassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces.\"\n\"Kitty has no discretion in her coughs,\" said her father; \"she times\nthem ill.\"\n\"I do not cough for my own amusement,\" replied Kitty, fretfully. \"When\nis your next ball to be, Lizzy?\"\n\"To-morrow fortnight.\"\n\"Ay, so it is,\" cried her mother, \"and Mrs. Long does not come back till\nthe day before; so, it will be impossible for her to introduce him, for\nshe will not know him herself.\"\n\"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and introduce\nMr. Bingley to _her_.\"\n\"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him\nmyself; how can you be so teasing?\"\n\"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight's acquaintance is certainly\nvery little. One cannot know what a man really is by the end of a\nfortnight. But if _we_ do not venture, somebody else will; and after\nall, Mrs. Long and her nieces must stand their chance; and, therefore,\nas she will think it an act of kindness, if you decline the office, I\nwill take it on myself.\"\nThe girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only, \"Nonsense,\nnonsense!\"\n\"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?\" cried he. \"Do\nyou consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that is laid on\nthem, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you _there_. What say you,\nMary? For you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read\ngreat books, and make extracts.\"\nMary wished to say something very sensible, but knew not how.\n\"While Mary is adjusting her ideas,\" he continued, \"let us return to Mr.\nBingley.\"\n\"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,\" cried his wife.\n\"I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did you not tell me so before? If I\nhad known as much this morning, I certainly would not have called on\nhim. It is very unlucky; but as I have actually paid the visit, we\ncannot escape the acquaintance now.\"\nThe astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished--that of Mrs.\nBennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though when the first tumult of joy\nwas over, she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the\nwhile.\n\"How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should\npersuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to\nneglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! And it is such a\ngood joke, too, that you should have gone this morning, and never said a\nword about it till now.\"\n\"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,\" said Mr. Bennet; and,\nas he spoke, he left the room, fatigued with the raptures of his wife.",

And when the party entered the\nassembly-room, it consisted of only five altogether: Mr. Bingley, his\ntwo sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.\nMr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant\ncountenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,\nwith an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely\nlooked the gentleman; but his friend Mr. Darcy soon drew the attention\nof the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien, and\nthe report, which was in general circulation within five minutes after\nhis entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen\npronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was\nmuch handsomer than Mr. Bingley, and he was looked at with great\nadmiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust\nwhich turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be\nproud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his\nlarge estate in Derbyshire could save him from having a most forbidding,\ndisagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be compared with his\nfriend.\nMr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal\npeople in the room: he was lively and unreserved, danced every dance,\nwas angry that the ball closed so early, and talked of giving one\nhimself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for\nthemselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced\nonly once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being\nintroduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in\nwalking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.\nHis character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in\nthe world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.",

            "text": "the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more\nquickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and\nwith a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was\nvery little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine\nladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the\npower of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.\nThey were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private\nseminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the\nhabit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people\nof rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of\nthemselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in\nthe north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their\nmemories than that their brother's fortune and their own had been\nacquired by trade.\nMr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred\nthousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,\nbut did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and\nsometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a\ngood house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those\nwho best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the\nremainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to\npurchase.\nHis sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but\nthough he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no\nmeans unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had\nmarried a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider\nhis house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of\nage two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to\nlook at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an\nhour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied\nwith what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.\nBetween him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a\ngreat opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the\neasiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition\ncould offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he\nnever appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy's regard, Bingley\nhad the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In\nunderstanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means\ndeficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,\nreserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not\ninviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley\nwas sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually\ngiving offence.\nThe manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently\ncharacteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier\ngirls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;\nthere had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted\nwith all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel\nmore beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people\nin whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had\nfelt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or\npleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too\nmuch.\nMrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired\nher and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom\nthey should not object to know more of. Miss Bennet was therefore\nestablished as a sweet girl; and their brother felt authorized by such\ncommendation to think of her as he chose.",

            "text": "Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets\nwere particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade\nin Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the\nhonour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The\ndistinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a\ndisgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;\nand, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about\na mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he\ncould think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by\nbusiness, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,\nthough elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the\ncontrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,\nfriendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James's had made him\ncourteous.\nLady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a\nvaluable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest\nof them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was\nElizabeth's intimate friend.\nThat the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a\nball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the assembly\nbrought the former to Longbourn to hear and to communicate.\n\"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,\" said Mrs. Bennet, with civil\nself-command, to Miss Lucas. \"_You_ were Mr. Bingley's first choice.\"\n\"Yes; but he seemed to like his second better.\"\n\"Oh, you mean Jane, I suppose, because he danced with her twice. To be\nsure that _did_ seem as if he admired her--indeed, I rather believe he\n_did_--I heard something about it--but I hardly know what--something\nabout Mr. Robinson.\"\n\"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not\nI mention it to you? Mr. Robinson's asking him how he liked our Meryton\nassemblies, and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty\nwomen in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his\nanswering immediately to the last question, 'Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,\nbeyond a doubt: there cannot be two opinions on that point.'\"\n\"Upon my word! Well, that was very decided, indeed--that does seem as\nif--but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know.\"\n\"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,\" said\nCharlotte. \"Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as his friend,\nis he? Poor Eliza! to be only just _tolerable_.\"\n\"I beg you will not put it into Lizzy's head to be vexed by his\nill-treatment, for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite\na misfortune to be liked by him. Mrs. Long told me last night that he\nsat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips.\"\n[Illustration: \"Without once opening his lips\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\"Are you quite sure, ma'am? Is not there a little mistake?\" said Jane.\n\"I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her.\"\n\"Ay, because she asked him at last how he liked Netherfield, and he\ncould not help answering her; but she said he seemed very angry at being\nspoke to.\"\n\"Miss Bingley told me,\" said Jane, \"that he never speaks much unless\namong his intimate acquaintance. With _them_ he is remarkably\nagreeable.\"\n\"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he had been so very\nagreeable, he would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how it\nwas; everybody says that he is eat up with pride, and I dare say he had\nheard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage, and had to come\nto the ball in a hack chaise.\"\n\"I do not mind his not talking to Mrs. Long,\" said Miss Lucas, \"but I\nwish he had danced with Eliza.\"\n\"Another time, Lizzy,\" said her mother, \"I would not dance with _him_,\nif I were you.\"\n\"I believe, ma'am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with him.\"\n\"His pride,\" said Miss Lucas, \"does not offend _me_ so much as pride\noften does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so\nvery fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,\nshould think highly of himself. If I may so express it, he has a _right_\nto be proud.\"\n\"That is very true,\" replied Elizabeth, \"and I could easily forgive\n_his_ pride, if he had not mortified _mine_.\"\n\"Pride,\" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her\nreflections, \"is a very common failing, I believe. By all that I have\never read, I am convinced that it is very common indeed; that human\nnature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us\nwho do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some\nquality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different\nthings, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be\nproud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of\nourselves; vanity to what we would have others think of us.\"\n\"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,\" cried a young Lucas, who came with his\nsisters, \"I should not care how proud I was. I would keep a pack of\nfoxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine every day.\"\n\"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,\" said Mrs.\nBennet; \"and if I were to see you at it, I should take away your bottle\ndirectly.\"\nThe boy protested that she should not; she continued to declare that she\nwould; and the argument ended only with the visit.",

We can all\n_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are\nvery few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without\nencouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_\naffection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he\nmay never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.\"\n\"But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can\nperceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to\ndiscover it too.\"\n\"Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane's disposition as you do.\"\n\"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal\nit, he must find it out.\"\n\"Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane\nmeet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they\nalways see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that\nevery moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should\ntherefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his\nattention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling\nin love as much as she chooses.\"",

            "text": "\"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!\" said Mrs. Bennet, more than\nonce, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\nmorning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\ncontrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\nbrought the following note for Elizabeth:--\n/* NIND \"My dearest Lizzie, */\n\"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\nimputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will\nnot hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on\nmy seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\nof his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\nheadache, there is not much the matter with me.\n\"Yours, etc.\"\n\"Well, my dear,\" said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\naloud, \"if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\nshould die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\nMr. Bingley, and under your orders.\"\n\"Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\ntrifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\nthere, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\ncarriage.\"\nElizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\ncarriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\nher only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n\"How can you be so silly,\" cried her mother, \"as to think of such a\nthing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\nthere.\"\n\"I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.\"\n\"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,\" said her father, \"to send for the\nhorses?\"\n\"No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\nwhen one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.\"\n\"I admire the activity of your benevolence,\" observed Mary, \"but every\nimpulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\nexertion should always be in proportion to what is required.\"\n\"We will go as far as Meryton with you,\" said Catherine and Lydia.\nElizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\ntogether.",

Her dirty petticoat quite\nescaped my notice.\"\n\"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley; \"and I am\ninclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\nan exhibition.\"\n\"Certainly not.\"\n\"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\nabove her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\nit? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\na most country-town indifference to decorum.\"\n\"It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,\" said\nBingley.\n\"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,\" observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n\"that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\neyes.\"\n\"Not at all,\" he replied: \"they were brightened by the exercise.\" A\nshort pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--\n\"I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet\ngirl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such\na father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no\nchance of it.\"\n\"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in\nMeryton?\"\n\"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.\"\n\"That is capital,\" added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.\n\"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,\" cried Bingley, \"it\nwould not make them one jot less agreeable.\"\n\"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any\nconsideration in the world,\" replied Darcy.\nTo this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their\nhearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of\ntheir dear friend's vulgar relations.",

On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole\nparty at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting\nthem to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the\nexcuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay\nbelow, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.\n\"Do you prefer reading to cards?\" said he; \"that is rather singular.\"\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, \"despises cards. She is a great\nreader, and has no pleasure in anything else.\"\n\"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,\" cried Elizabeth; \"I\nam _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.\"\n\"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,\" said Bingley; \"and\nI hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.\"\nElizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table\nwhere a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her\nothers; all that his library afforded.\n\"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own\ncredit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more\nthan I ever looked into.\"\nElizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those\nin the room.\n\"I am astonished,\" said Miss Bingley, \"that my father should have left\nso small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at\nPemberley, Mr. Darcy!\"\n\"It ought to be good,\" he replied: \"it has been the work of many\ngenerations.\"\n\"And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying\nbooks.\"\n\"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as\nthese.\"\n\"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of\nthat noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be\nhalf as delightful as Pemberley.\"\n\"I wish it may.\"\n\"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that\nneighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a\nfiner county in England than Derbyshire.\"\n\"With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.\"\n\"I am talking of possibilities, Charles.\"\n\"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get\nPemberley by purchase than by imitation.\"\nElizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little\nattention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near\nthe card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest\nsister, to observe the game.\n\"Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?\" said Miss Bingley: \"will\nshe be as tall as I am?\"\n\"I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet's height, or\nrather taller.\"\n\"How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me\nso much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished\nfor her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.\"\n\"It is amazing to me,\" said Bingley, \"how young ladies can have patience\nto be so very accomplished as they all are.\"\n\"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?\"\n\"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and\nnet purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am\nsure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without\nbeing informed that she was very accomplished.\"\n\"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,\" said Darcy, \"has\ntoo much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no\notherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very\nfar from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I\ncannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my\nacquaintance that are really accomplished.\"\n\"Nor I, I am sure,\" said Miss Bingley.\n\"Then,\" observed Elizabeth, \"you must comprehend a great deal in your\nidea of an accomplished woman.\"\n\"Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.\"\n\"Oh, certainly,\" cried his faithful assistant, \"no one can be really\nesteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met\nwith. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,\ndancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all\nthis, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of\nwalking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word\nwill be but half deserved.\"\n\"All this she must possess,\" added Darcy; \"and to all she must yet add\nsomething more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive\nreading.\"\n\"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.\nI rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.\"\n\"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all\nthis?\"\n\"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and\napplication, and elegance, as you describe, united.\"\nMrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her\nimplied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who\nanswered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with\nbitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all\nconversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the\nroom.\n\"Eliza Bennet,\" said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, \"is\none of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other\nsex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it\nsucceeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.\"\n\"Undoubtedly,\" replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,\n\"there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend\nto employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is\ndespicable.\"\nMiss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to\ncontinue the subject.\nElizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and\nthat she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones's being sent for\nimmediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could\nbe of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most\neminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so\nunwilling to comply with their brother's proposal; and it was settled\nthat Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet\nwere not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters\ndeclared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,\nhowever, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to\nhis feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every\npossible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.",

It does not necessarily follow that a deep,\nintricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.\"\n\"Lizzy,\" cried her mother, \"remember where you are, and do not run on in\nthe wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.\"\n\"I did not know before,\" continued Bingley, immediately, \"that you were\na studier of character. It must be an amusing study.\"\n\"Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at\nleast that advantage.\"\n\"The country,\" said Darcy, \"can in general supply but few subjects for\nsuch a study.

Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete\nvictory over him, continued her triumph,--\n\"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for\nmy part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal\npleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?\"\n\"When I am in the country,\" he replied, \"I never wish to leave it; and\nwhen I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their\nadvantages, and I can be equally happy in either.\"\n\"Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that\ngentleman,\" looking at Darcy, \"seemed to think the country was nothing\nat all.\"\n\"Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,\" said Elizabeth, blushing for her\nmother. \"You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not\nsuch a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which\nyou must acknowledge to be true.\"",

Everything nourishes what is\nstrong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I\nam convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.\"\nDarcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth\ntremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to\nspeak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.\nBennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to\nJane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was\nunaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be\ncivil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,\nindeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and\nsoon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of\nher daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to\neach other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the\nyoungest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming\ninto the country to give a ball at Netherfield.\nLydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion\nand good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose\naffection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high\nanimal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the\nattentions of the officers, to whom her uncle's good dinners and her\nown easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was\nvery equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the\nball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be\nthe most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer\nto this sudden attack was delightful to her mother's ear.\n\"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when\nyour sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of\nthe ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?\"\nLydia declared herself satisfied. \"Oh yes--it would be much better to\nwait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter\nwould be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,\" she\nadded, \"I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel\nForster it will be quite a shame if he does not.\"",

Mrs. Hurst and Miss\nBingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who\ncontinued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined\ntheir party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.\nMr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching\nthe progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by\nmessages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and\nMrs. Hurst was observing their game.\nElizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in\nattending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual\ncommendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness\nof his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern\nwith which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was\nexactly in unison with her opinion of each.\n\"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!\"\nHe made no answer.\n\"You write uncommonly fast.\"\n\"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.\"\n\"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a\nyear! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!\"\n\"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.\"\n\"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.\"\n\"I have already told her so once, by your desire.\"\n\"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I mend\npens remarkably well.\"\n\"Thank you--but I always mend my own.\"\n\"How can you contrive to write so even?\"\nHe was silent.\n\"Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,\nand pray let her know that I am quite in raptures with her beautiful\nlittle design for a table, and I think it infinitely superior to Miss\nGrantley's.\"\n\"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At\npresent I have not room to do them justice.\"\n\"Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you\nalways write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?\"\n\"They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me\nto determine.\"\n\"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with\nease cannot write ill.\"\n\"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,\" cried her\nbrother, \"because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much\nfor words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?\"\n\"My style of writing is very different from yours.\"\n\"Oh,\" cried Miss Bingley, \"Charles writes in the most careless way\nimaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.\"\n\"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which\nmeans my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.\"\n\"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,\" said Elizabeth, \"must disarm reproof.\"\n\"Nothing is more deceitful,\" said Darcy, \"than the appearance of\nhumility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an\nindirect boast.\"\n\"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?\"\n\"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in\nwriting, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of\nthought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you\nthink at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with\nquickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any\nattention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.\nBennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield\nyou should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of\npanegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very\nlaudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business\nundone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?\"\n\"Nay,\" cried Bingley, \"this is too much, to remember at night all the\nfoolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I\nbelieved what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this\nmoment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless\nprecipitance merely to show off before the ladies.\"\n\"I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you\nwould be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as\ndependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were\nmounting your horse, a friend were to say, 'Bingley, you had better stay\ntill next week,' you would probably do it--you would probably not\ngo--and, at another word, might stay a month.\"\n\"You have only proved by this,\" cried Elizabeth, \"that Mr. Bingley did\nnot do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much\nmore than he did himself.\"\n\"I am exceedingly gratified,\" said Bingley, \"by your converting what my\nfriend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am\nafraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means\nintend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a\ncircumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I\ncould.\"\n\"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention\nas atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?\"\n\"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for\nhimself.\"\n\"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,\nbut which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to\nstand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,\nthat the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and\nthe delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering\none argument in favour of its propriety.\"\n\"To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit\nwith you.\"\n\"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of\neither.\"\n\"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of\nfriendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make\none readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason\none into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have\nsupposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the\ncircumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour\nthereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,\nwhere one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no\nvery great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying\nwith the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?\"\n\"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange\nwith rather more precision the degree of importance which is to\nappertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting\nbetween the parties?\"\n\"By all means,\" cried Bingley; \"let us hear all the particulars, not\nforgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more\nweight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure\nyou that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with\nmyself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not\nknow a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in\nparticular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,\nwhen he has nothing to do.\"\nMr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was\nrather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly\nresented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her\nbrother for talking such nonsense.\n\"I see your design, Bingley,\" said his friend. \"You dislike an argument,\nand want to silence this.\"\n\"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss\nBennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very\nthankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.\"\n\"What you ask,\" said Elizabeth, \"is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.\nDarcy had much better finish his letter.\"\nMr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.",

She\ncould not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her\nquestion and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be\namused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the\nsecond volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, \"How pleasant it\nis to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no\nenjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a\nbook! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not\nan excellent library.\"\nNo one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and\ncast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing\nher brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly\ntowards him and said,--\n\"By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at\nNetherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult\nthe wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not\nsome among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a\npleasure.\"\n\"If you mean Darcy,\" cried her brother, \"he may go to bed, if he\nchooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled\nthing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send\nround my cards.\"\n\"I should like balls infinitely better,\" she replied, \"if they were\ncarried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably\ntedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much\nmore rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the\nday.\"\n\"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be\nnear so much like a ball.\"\nMiss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about\nthe room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at\nwhom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the\ndesperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,\nturning to Elizabeth, said,--\n\"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and take a\nturn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing after sitting so\nlong in one attitude.\"\nElizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss Bingley\nsucceeded no less in the real object of her civility: Mr. Darcy looked\nup. He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as\nElizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously closed his book. He was\ndirectly invited to join their party, but he declined it, observing that\nhe could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down\nthe room together, with either of which motives his joining them would\ninterfere. What could he mean?

Intimate\nas you are, you must know how it is to be done.\"\n\"But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not\nyet taught me _that_.

I dearly love a\nlaugh.\"\n\"Miss Bingley,\" said he, \"has given me credit for more than can be. The\nwisest and best of men,--nay, the wisest and best of their actions,--may\nbe rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a\njoke.\"\n\"Certainly,\" replied Elizabeth, \"there are such people, but I hope I am\nnot one of _them_.

But it has been the study of\nmy life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong\nunderstanding to ridicule.\"\n\"Such as vanity and pride.\"\n\"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real\nsuperiority of mind--pride will be always under good regulation.\"\nElizabeth turned away to hide a smile.\n\"Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume,\" said Miss Bingley;\n\"and pray what is the result?\"\n\"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it\nhimself without disguise.\"\n\"No,\" said Darcy, \"I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,\nbut they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch\nfor. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the\nconvenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of\nothers so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My\nfeelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper\nwould perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for\never.\"\n\"_That_ is a failing, indeed!\" cried Elizabeth. \"Implacable resentment\n_is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your fault well. I\nreally cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.\"\n\"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular\nevil, a natural defect, which not even the best education can overcome.\"\n\"And _your_ defect is a propensity to hate everybody.\"\n\"And yours,\" he replied, with a smile, \"is wilfully to misunderstand\nthem.\"\n\"Do let us have a little music,\" cried Miss Bingley, tired of a\nconversation in which she had no share. \"Louisa, you will not mind my\nwaking Mr. Hurst.\"",

But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on\nher daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which\nwould exactly finish Jane's week, could not bring herself to receive\nthem with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at\nleast not to Elizabeth's wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.\nBennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage\nbefore Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley\nand his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very\nwell. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively\nresolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the\ncontrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,\nshe urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley's carriage immediately, and at\nlength it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield\nthat morning should be mentioned, and the request made.\nThe communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was\nsaid of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on\nJane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was\nthen sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike\nof one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.\nThe master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so\nsoon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be\nsafe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where\nshe felt herself to be right.\nTo Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at\nNetherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss\nBingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He\nwisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration\nshould _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of\ninfluencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been\nsuggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight\nin confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke\nten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at\none time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most\nconscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.\nOn Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost\nall, took place. Miss Bingley's civility to Elizabeth increased at last\nvery rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,\nafter assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to\nsee her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most\ntenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of\nthe whole party in the liveliest spirits.",

He was a tall,\nheavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and\nstately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated\nbefore he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of\ndaughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this\ninstance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not\ndoubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This\ngallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.\nBennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--\n\"You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may\nprove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so\noddly.\"\n\"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.\"\n\"Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you\nmust confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,\nI know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates\nwill go when once they come to be entailed.\"\n\"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and\ncould say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing\nforward and precipitate.

They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins's admiration. The\nhall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;\nand his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet's\nheart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his\nown future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;\nand he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its\ncookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured\nhim, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good\ncook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged\npardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared\nherself not at all offended; but he continued to apologize for about a\nquarter of an hour.",

            "text": "During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the servants\nwere withdrawn, he thought it time to have some conversation with his\nguest, and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to\nshine, by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness. Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh's attention to his wishes, and consideration for his\ncomfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen\nbetter. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him\nto more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect\nhe protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a\nperson of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself\nexperienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to\napprove of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of\npreaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,\nand had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of\nquadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many\npeople, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.\nShe had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she\nmade not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the\nneighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or\ntwo to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to\nmarry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had\nonce paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly\napproved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed\nto suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.\n\"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"and I\ndare say she is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that great ladies\nin general are not more like her. Does she live near you, sir?\"\n\"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by a lane\nfrom Rosings Park, her Ladyship's residence.\"\n\"I think you said she was a widow, sir? has she any family?\"\n\"She has one only daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very\nextensive property.\"\n\"Ah,\" cried Mrs. Bennet, shaking her head, \"then she is better off than\nmany girls. And what sort of young lady is she? Is she handsome?\"\n\"She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says\nthat, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far superior to the\nhandsomest of her sex; because there is that in her features which marks\nthe young woman of distinguished birth. She is unfortunately of a sickly\nconstitution, which has prevented her making that progress in many\naccomplishments which she could not otherwise have failed of, as I am\ninformed by the lady who superintended her education, and who still\nresides with them. But she is perfectly amiable, and often condescends\nto drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies.\"\n\"Has she been presented? I do not remember her name among the ladies at\ncourt.\"\n\"Her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town;\nand by that means, as I told Lady Catherine myself one day, has deprived\nthe British Court of its brightest ornament. Her Ladyship seemed pleased\nwith the idea; and you may imagine that I am happy on every occasion to\noffer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to\nladies. I have more than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her\ncharming daughter seemed born to be a duchess; and that the most\nelevated rank, instead of giving her consequence, would be adorned by\nher. These are the kind of little things which please her Ladyship, and\nit is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound to\npay.\"\n\"You judge very properly,\" said Mr. Bennet; \"and it is happy for you\nthat you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May I ask\nwhether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the\nmoment, or are the result of previous study?\"\n\"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time; and though I\nsometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant\ncompliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions, I always wish to\ngive them as unstudied an air as possible.\"\nMr. Bennet's expectations were fully answered. His cousin was as absurd\nas he had hoped; and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment,\nmaintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance,\nand, except in an occasional glance at Elizabeth, requiring no partner\nin his pleasure.",

My aunt told me\nso herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow to hear more\nabout it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from town.\"\nLydia was bid by her two eldest sisters to hold her tongue; but Mr.\nCollins, much offended, laid aside his book, and said,--\n\"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books\nof a serious stamp, though written solely for their benefit. It amazes\nme, I confess; for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to\nthem as instruction. But I will no longer importune my young cousin.\"\nThen, turning to Mr. Bennet, he offered himself as his antagonist at\nbackgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that he acted\nvery wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements. Mrs.\nBennet and her daughters apologized most civilly for Lydia's\ninterruption, and promised that it should not occur again, if he would\nresume his book; but Mr. Collins, after assuring them that he bore his\nyoung cousin no ill-will, and should never resent her behaviour as any\naffront, seated himself at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared\nfor backgammon.",

Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to\nintroduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day\nbefore from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in\ntheir corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted\nonly regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was\ngreatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine\ncountenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction\nwas followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a\nreadiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the\nwhole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,\nwhen the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were\nseen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group\nthe two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual\ncivilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the\nprincipal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on\npurpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and\nwas beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they\nwere suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth\nhappening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,\nwas all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,\none looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,\ntouched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.\nWhat could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was\nimpossible not to long to know.\nIn another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what\npassed, took leave and rode on with his friend.\nMr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of",

She received him with\nher very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,\napologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with\nher, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be\njustified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to\nher notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good\nbreeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to\nby exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she\ncould only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had\nbrought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant's\ncommission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,\nshe said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham\nappeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;\nbut unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the\nofficers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become \"stupid,\ndisagreeable fellows.\" Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the\nnext day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.\nWickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn\nwould come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips\nprotested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery\ntickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such\ndelights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.\nCollins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,\nwith unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.",

            "text": "Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was\nturned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated\nhimself; and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into\nconversation, though it was only on its being a wet night, and on the\nprobability of a rainy season, made her feel that the commonest,\ndullest, most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the\nskill of the speaker.\nWith such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and the\nofficers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to the young\nladies he certainly was nothing; but he had still at intervals a kind\nlistener in Mrs. Philips, and was, by her watchfulness, most abundantly\nsupplied with coffee and muffin.\nWhen the card tables were placed, he had an opportunity of obliging her,\nin return, by sitting down to whist.\n\"I know little of the game at present,\" said he, \"but I shall be glad to\nimprove myself; for in my situation of life----\" Mrs. Philips was very\nthankful for his compliance, but could not wait for his reason.\nMr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he\nreceived at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there\nseemed danger of Lydia's engrossing him entirely, for she was a most\ndetermined talker; but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets,\nshe soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets\nand exclaiming after prizes, to have attention for anyone in particular.\nAllowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore\nat leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,\nthough what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,\nthe history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even\nmention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly\nrelieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far\nNetherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in\na hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.\n\"About a month,\" said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject\ndrop, added, \"he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I\nunderstand.\"\n\"Yes,\" replied Wickham; \"his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten\nthousand per annum. You could not have met with a person more capable of\ngiving you certain information on that head than myself--for I have been\nconnected with his family, in a particular manner, from my infancy.\"\nElizabeth could not but look surprised.\n\"You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion, after\nseeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our meeting\nyesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?\"\n\"As much as I ever wish to be,\" cried Elizabeth, warmly. \"I have spent\nfour days in the same house with him, and I think him very\ndisagreeable.\"\n\"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,\" said Wickham, \"as to his being\nagreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him\ntoo long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to\nbe impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general\nastonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly\nanywhere else. Here you are in your own family.\"\n\"Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the\nneighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in\nHertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his pride. You will not find\nhim more favourably spoken of by anyone.\"\n\"I cannot pretend to be sorry,\" said Wickham, after a short\ninterruption, \"that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond\ntheir deserts; but with _him_ I believe it does not often happen. The\nworld is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his\nhigh and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chooses to be seen.\"",

I hope your plans in favour of the ----shire will\nnot be affected by his being in the neighbourhood.\"\n\"Oh no--it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If _he_\nwishes to avoid seeing _me_ he must go. We are not on friendly terms,\nand it always gives me pain to meet him, but I have no reason for\navoiding _him_ but what I might proclaim to all the world--a sense of\nvery great ill-usage, and most painful regrets at his being what he is.\nHis father, Miss Bennet, the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men\nthat ever breathed, and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be\nin company with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a\nthousand tender recollections. His behaviour to myself has been\nscandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him anything and\neverything, rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the\nmemory of his father.\"\nElizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and listened with\nall her heart; but the delicacy of it prevented further inquiry.\nMr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the\nneighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all that he\nhad yet seen, and speaking of the latter, especially, with gentle but\nvery intelligible gallantry.\n\"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,\" he added,\n\"which was my chief inducement to enter the ----shire. I know it to be a\nmost respectable, agreeable corps; and my friend Denny tempted me\nfurther by his account of their present quarters, and the very great\nattentions and excellent acquaintance Meryton had procured them.\nSociety, I own, is necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and\nmy spirits will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society.\nA military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances have\nnow made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my profession--I\nwas brought up for the church; and I should at this time have been in\npossession of a most valuable living, had it pleased the gentleman we\nwere speaking of just now.\"\n\"Indeed!\"\n\"Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best\nliving in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.\nI cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,\nand thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given\nelsewhere.\"\n\"Good heavens!\" cried Elizabeth; \"but how could _that_ be? How could his\nwill be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?\"\n\"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to\ngive me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the\nintention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely\nconditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim\nto it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.\nCertain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I\nwas of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no\nless certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done\nanything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I\nmay perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too\nfreely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very\ndifferent sort of men, and that he hates me.\"\n\"This is quite shocking! He deserves to be publicly disgraced.\"\n\"Some time or other he _will_ be--but it shall not be by _me_. Till I\ncan forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.\"\nElizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than\never as he expressed them.\n\"But what,\" said she, after a pause, \"can have been his motive? what can\nhave induced him to behave so cruelly?\"\n\"A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but\nattribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me\nless, his son might have borne with me better; but his father's uncommon\nattachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had\nnot a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort\nof preference which was often given me.\"\n\"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked\nhim, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be\ndespising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of\ndescending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as",

He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most\nintimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to\nbe under the greatest obligations to my father's active superintendence;\nand when, immediately before my father's death, Mr. Darcy gave him a\nvoluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it\nto be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.\"\n\"How strange!\" cried Elizabeth. \"How abominable! I wonder that the very\npride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better\nmotive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for\ndishonesty I must call it.\"\n\"It _is_ wonderful,\" replied Wickham; \"for almost all his actions may be\ntraced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has\nconnected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none\nof us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger\nimpulses even than pride.\"\n\"Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?\"\n\"Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money\nfreely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the\npoor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his\nfather was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to\ndegenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the\nPemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,\nwhich, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and\ncareful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up\nas the most attentive and best of brothers.\"\n\"What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?\"\nHe shook his head. \"I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to\nspeak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very\nproud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond\nof me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is\nnothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,\nand, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father's death her\nhome has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her\neducation.\"",

The usual inquiries as to his success were\nmade by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;\nbut when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured\nher, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;\nthat he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not\nmake herself uneasy.\n\"I know very well, madam,\" said he, \"that when persons sit down to a\ncard table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I\nam not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There\nare, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady\nCatherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding\nlittle matters.\"\nMr. Wickham's attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for\na few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations\nwere very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.\n\"Lady Catherine de Bourgh,\" she replied, \"has very lately given him a\nliving. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her\nnotice, but he certainly has not known her long.\"\n\"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy\nwere sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.\"\n\"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine's\nconnections. I never heard of her existence till the day before\nyesterday.\"\n\"Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is\nbelieved that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.\"\nThis information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss\nBingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her\naffection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already\nself-destined to another.\n\"Mr. Collins,\" said she, \"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her\ndaughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her\nLadyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of\nher being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.\"\n\"I believe her to be both in a great degree,\" replied Wickham; \"I have\nnot seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked\nher, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the\nreputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe\nshe derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from\nher authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who\nchooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of\nthe first class.\"\nElizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and\nthey continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put\nan end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.",

She had fully proposed being\nengaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins\ninstead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help\nfor it, however. Mr. Wickham's happiness and her own was perforce\ndelayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins's proposal accepted with as\ngood a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his\ngallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first\nstruck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of\nbeing the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a\nquadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.\nThe idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing\ncivilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a\ncompliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than\ngratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before\nher mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage\nwas exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose\nto take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the\nconsequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,\ntill he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.\nIf there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the",

Elizabeth made no\nanswer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which\nshe was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and\nreading in her neighbours' looks their equal amazement in beholding it.\nThey stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to\nimagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at\nfirst, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it\nwould be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,\nshe made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again\nsilent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,\nwith--\n\"It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the\ndance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the\nroom, or the number of couples.\"\nHe smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be\nsaid.\n\"Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I\nmay observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but\n_now_ we may be silent.\"\n\"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?\"\n\"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be\nentirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of\n_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the\ntrouble of saying as little as possible.\"\n\"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you\nimagine that you are gratifying mine?\"\n\"Both,\" replied Elizabeth archly; \"for I have always seen a great\nsimilarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,\ntaciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say\nsomething that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to\nposterity with all the _\u00e9clat_ of a proverb.\"\n\"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,\"\nsaid he. \"How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_\nthink it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.\"\n\"I must not decide on my own performance.\"\nHe made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down\nthe dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often\nwalk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist\nthe temptation, added, \"When you met us there the other day, we had just\nbeen forming a new acquaintance.\"\nThe effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his\nfeatures, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself\nfor her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a\nconstrained manner said,--\n\"Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his\n_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,\nis less certain.\"\n\"He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,\" replied Elizabeth,\nwith emphasis, \"and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all\nhis life.\"\nDarcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At\nthat moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass\nthrough the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.\nDarcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on\nhis dancing and his partner.\n\"I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very\nsuperior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the\nfirst circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not\ndisgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,\nespecially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing\nat her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will\nthen flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.\nYou will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of\nthat young lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me.\"\n[Illustration:\n\"Such very superior dancing is not\noften seen.\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\nThe latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but Sir\nWilliam's allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly, and his\neyes were directed, with a very serious expression, towards Bingley and\nJane, who were dancing together. Recovering himself, however, shortly,\nhe turned to his partner, and said,--\n\"Sir William's interruption has made me forget what we were talking\nof.\"\n\"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not have\ninterrupted any two people in the room who had less to say for\nthemselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without success,\nand what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.\"\n\"What think you of books?\" said he, smiling.\n\"Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same\nfeelings.\"\n\"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be\nno want of subject. We may compare our different opinions.\"\n\"No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of\nsomething else.\"\n\"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?\" said he,\nwith a look of doubt.\n\"Yes, always,\" she replied, without knowing what she said; for her\nthoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared\nby her suddenly exclaiming, \"I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,\nthat you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was\nunappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being\ncreated_?\"\n\"I am,\" said he, with a firm voice.\n\"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?\"\n\"I hope not.\"\n\"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,\nto be secure of judging properly at first.\"\n\"May I ask to what these questions tend?\"\n\"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,\" said she, endeavouring\nto shake off her gravity. \"I am trying to make it out.\"\n\"And what is your success?\"\nShe shook her head. \"I do not get on at all. I hear such different\naccounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.\"\n\"I can readily believe,\" answered he, gravely, \"that reports may vary\ngreatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were\nnot to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to\nfear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.\"\n\"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another\nopportunity.\"\n\"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,\" he coldly replied.\nShe said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in",

Mrs. Hurst and her\nsister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and\nwere evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed\nevery attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a\nlanguor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long\nspeeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his\nsisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and\npoliteness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said\nnothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.\nMr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the\nrest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a\nsilence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too\nmuch fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of \"Lord,\nhow tired I am!\" accompanied by a violent yawn.\nWhen at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly\ncivil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and\naddressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy\nhe would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,\nwithout the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful\npleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of\nwaiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to\ngo the next day for a short time.\nMrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the\ndelightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of\nsettlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly\nsee her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four\nmonths. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought\nwith equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.\nElizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the\nman and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each\nwas eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.",

You\nwould have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little\nunwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected\nmother's permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport\nof my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to\ndissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as\nsoon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my\nfuture life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\nsubject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\nmarrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\nof selecting a wife, as I certainly did.\"\nThe idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\nwith by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\nuse the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\nhe continued,--\n\"My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\nevery clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\nof matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\nvery greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\nhave mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\nrecommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\npatroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\ntoo!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\nleft Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\narranging Miss De Bourgh's footstool,--that she said, 'Mr. Collins, you\nmust marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\ngentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\nuseful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\nincome go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\nyou can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.' Allow me, by the\nway, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\nkindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\nadvantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\nanything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\nacceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\nwhich her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\nintention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\nwere directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\nassure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\nbeing, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\nfather (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\nmyself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\nthe loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\nevent takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\nfor several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\nflatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\nremains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\nviolence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\nshall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\naware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\nin the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother's\ndecease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\ntherefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\nno ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.\"",

I am very sensible of the honour of\nyour proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\nthem.\"\n\"I am not now to learn,\" replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\nhand, \"that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\nman whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\nfavour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\nthird time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\njust said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.\"\n\"Upon my word, sir,\" cried Elizabeth, \"your hope is rather an\nextraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\none of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\ndaring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\ntime. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\nhappy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\nwould make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\nam persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\nsituation.\"\n\"Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,\" said Mr. Collins,\nvery gravely--\"but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\ndisapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\nseeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\neconomy, and other amiable qualifications.\"\n\"Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\ngive me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\nbelieving what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\nrefusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\nIn making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\nfeelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\nestate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\nconsidered, therefore, as finally settled.\" And rising as she thus\nspoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\naddressed her,--\n\"When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\nshall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\nme; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\nknow it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\nfirst application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\nencourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\nfemale character.\"\n\"Really, Mr. Collins,\" cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, \"you puzzle me\nexceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\nof encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\nmay convince you of its being one.\"\n\"You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\nrefusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\nbelieving it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\nis unworthy of your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer\nwould be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my\nconnections with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your\nown, are circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into\nfurther consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is\nby no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you.\nYour portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo\nthe effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\ntherefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\nshall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\nsuspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.\"\n\"I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\nof elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\nrather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\nagain and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\nto accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\nforbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\nfemale intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\ntruth from her heart.\"\n\"You are uniformly charming!\" cried he, with an air of awkward\ngallantry; \"and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\nauthority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\nbeing acceptable.\"\nTo such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\nreply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\npersisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\nencouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\nin such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\nnot be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.",

            "text": "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\nand could not help saying so.\n\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\na very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\nI will _make_ her know it.\"\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if she\nis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\nforce her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\ngood-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out, as she entered the library,--\n\"Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\nnot have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have _her_.\"\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\non her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by\nher communication.\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\nfinished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.\"\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\nmarrying him.\"\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\nlibrary.\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\"\nElizabeth replied that it was.\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\n\"I have, sir.\"\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\naccepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\nbe a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\nif you _do_.\"\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\nto _insist_ upon her marrying him.\"\n\"My dear,\" replied her husband, \"I have two small favours to request.\nFirst, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\npresent occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\nlibrary to myself as soon as may be.\"\nNot yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\nMrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\ncoaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\nher interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\ninterfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\nsometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\nvaried, however, her determination never did.\nMr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.",

I depend on you for that.'\" To these\nhigh-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\nintercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.\"\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.\n\"'When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\nwhom we shall deprive you.'\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\nwinter.\"",

I _will_ read you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. 'Mr. Darcy is\nimpatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\nless eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\nher equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\nshe inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\nmore interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\nhereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\nyou my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\nwithout confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister's\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?' What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\" said\nJane, as she finished it. \"Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\ndeclare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\nthat she is perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference; and that\nif she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\nkindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\nsubject?\"\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?\"\n\"Most willingly.\"\n\"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.\"\nJane shook her head.\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\ntogether can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\nis not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\nDarcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\ncase is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\nis the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\nthat when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\nin achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\ndearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\nof being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"",

He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\nfrom a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\nconjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\ntill its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\nsecure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\nhe was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\nreception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\nperceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\ninstantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\nshe dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\nIn as short a time as Mr. Collins's long speeches would allow,\neverything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\nthey entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\nwas to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\nbe waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\nhis happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\nguard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\ncontinuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\ndisinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\nestablishment were gained.",

Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment: but Sir William's good-breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\nMrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\nor Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.",

The very first\nsentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for\nthe winter, and concluded with her brother's regret at not having had\ntime to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left\nthe country.\nHope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of\nthe letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the\nwriter, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy's praise occupied\nthe chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline\nboasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict\nthe accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former\nletter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother's being an\ninmate of Mr. Darcy's house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of\nthe latter with regard to new furniture.\nElizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,\nheard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern\nfor her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline's\nassertion of her brother's being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no\ncredit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she\nhad ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she\ncould not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness\nof temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave\nof his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to\nthe caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been\nthe only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in\nwhatever manner he thought best; but her sister's was involved in it, as\nshe thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on\nwhich reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She\ncould think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley's regard had\nreally died away, or were suppressed by his friends' interference;\nwhether he had been aware of Jane's attachment, or whether it had\nescaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of\nhim must be materially affected by the difference, her sister's\nsituation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.",

But I\nwill not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall\nall be as we were before.\"\nElizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said\nnothing.\n\"You doubt me,\" cried Jane, slightly colouring; \"indeed, you have no\nreason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my\nacquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and\nnothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little\ntime, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----\"\nWith a stronger voice she soon added, \"I have this comfort immediately,\nthat it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it\nhas done no harm to anyone but myself.\"\n\"My dear Jane,\" exclaimed Elizabeth, \"you are too good. Your sweetness\nand disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to\nyou. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you\ndeserve.\"\nMiss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back\nthe praise on her sister's warm affection.\n\"Nay,\" said Elizabeth, \"this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the\nworld respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want\nto think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be\nafraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your\nprivilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people\nwhom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see\nof the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms\nmy belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the\nlittle dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit\nor sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,\nthe other is Charlotte's marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it\nis unaccountable!\"\n\"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will\nruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of\nsituation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins's respectability, and\nCharlotte's prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a\nlarge family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be\nready to believe, for everybody's sake, that she may feel something like\nregard and esteem for our cousin.\"\n\"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else\ncould be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that\nCharlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her\nunderstanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a\nconceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as\nI do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him\ncannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though\nit is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,\nchange the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade\nyourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of\ndanger security for happiness.\"\n\"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,\" replied\nJane; \"and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy\ntogether. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You\nmentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat\nyou, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and\nsaying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy\nourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man\nto be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but\nour own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than\nit does.\"\n\"And men take care that they should.\"\n\"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea\nof there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.\"\n\"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley's conduct to design,\"\nsaid Elizabeth; \"but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others\nunhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,\nwant of attention to other people's feelings, and want of resolution,\nwill do the business.\"\n\"And do you impute it to either of those?\"\n\"Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I\nthink of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.\"\n\"You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?\"\n\"Yes, in conjunction with his friend.\"\n\"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can\nonly wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can\nsecure it.\"\n\"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his\nhappiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they\nmay wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great\nconnections, and pride.\"\n\"Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,\" replied Jane;\n\"but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have\nknown her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love\nher better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely\nthey should have opposed their brother's. What sister would think\nherself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very\nobjectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to\npart us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an\naffection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most\nunhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been\nmistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of\nwhat I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it\nin the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.\"\nElizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley's\nname was scarcely ever mentioned between them.",

But these things happen so often! A young man,\nsuch as you describe Mr. Bingley, so easily falls in love with a pretty\ngirl for a few weeks, and, when accident separates them, so easily\nforgets her, that these sort of inconstancies are very frequent.\"\n[Illustration:\n\"Offended two or three young ladies\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\"An excellent consolation in its way,\" said Elizabeth; \"but it will not\ndo for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not often happen\nthat the interference of friends will persuade a young man of\nindependent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in\nlove with only a few days before.\"\n\"But that expression of 'violently in love' is so hackneyed, so\ndoubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is as\noften applied to feelings which arise only from a half hour's\nacquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent was_\nMr. Bingley's love?\"\n\"I never saw a more promising inclination; he was growing quite\ninattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her. Every time\nthey met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his own ball he\noffended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance; and I\nspoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer. Could there be\nfiner symptoms? Is not general incivility the very essence of love?\"\n\"Oh, yes! of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor\nJane! I am sorry for her, because, with her disposition, she may not get\nover it immediately. It had better have happened to _you_, Lizzy; you\nwould have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would\nbe prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of\nservice--and perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as\nanything.\"\nElizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded\nof her sister's ready acquiescence.\n\"I hope,\" added Mrs. Gardiner, \"that no consideration with regard to\nthis young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of\ntown, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go\nout so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all,\nunless he really comes to see her.\"\n\"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he is now in the custody of his\nfriend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him to call on Jane in such a\npart of London! My dear aunt, how could you think of it? Mr. Darcy may,\nperhaps, have _heard_ of such a place as Gracechurch Street, but he\nwould hardly think a month's ablution enough to cleanse him from its\nimpurities, were he once to enter it; and, depend upon it, Mr. Bingley\nnever stirs without him.\"\n\"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does not Jane\ncorrespond with his sister? _She_ will not be able to help calling.\"\n\"She will drop the acquaintance entirely.\"\nBut, in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this\npoint, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley's being\nwithheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which\nconvinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely\nhopeless. It was possible, and sometimes she thought it probable, that\nhis affection might be re-animated, and the influence of his friends\nsuccessfully combated by the more natural influence of Jane's",

Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve\nyourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of\nfortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against\n_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he\nought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you\nmust not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all\nexpect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and\ngood conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.\"\n\"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.\"\n\"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.\"\n\"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of\nmyself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I\ncan prevent it.\"\n\"Elizabeth, you are not serious now.\"\n\"I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with\nMr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,\nthe most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to\nme--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence\nof it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father's opinion of me does\nme the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My\nfather, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I\nshould be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but\nsince we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are\nseldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into\nengagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many\nof my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that\nit would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is\nnot to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his\nfirst object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In\nshort, I will do my best.\"\n\"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very\noften. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.\"\n\"As I did the other day,\" said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; \"very\ntrue, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine\nthat he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been\nso frequently invited this week. You know my mother's ideas as to the\nnecessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my\nhonour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you\nare satisfied.\"\nHer aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for\nthe kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice\nbeing given on such a point without being resented.",

She endeavoured to\npersuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be\nblind to Miss Bingley's inattention. After waiting at home every morning\nfor a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the\nvisitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet\nmore, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself\nno longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister\nwill prove what she felt:--\n\"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in\nher better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have\nbeen entirely deceived in Miss Bingley's regard for me. But, my\ndear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me\nobstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour\nwas, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at\nall comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,\nif the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should\nbe deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;\nand not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she\ndid come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she\nmade a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a\nword of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so\naltered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly\nresolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I\ncannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as\nshe did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on\nher side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been\nacting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her\nbrother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and\nthough _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she\nfeels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so\ndeservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may\nfeel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,\nhowever, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all\ncared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my\nbeing in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and\nyet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to\npersuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot\nunderstand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be\nalmost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of\nduplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful\nthought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,\nand the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear\nfrom you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never\nreturning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not\nwith any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely\nglad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at\nHunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am\nsure you will be very comfortable there.\n\"Yours, etc.\"\nThis letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she\nconsidered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.\nAll expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not\neven wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every\nreview of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible\nadvantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.\nDarcy's sister, as, by Wickham's account, she would make him abundantly\nregret what he had thrown away.",

It was reasonable, however, to\nhope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the\nparticulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch Street, and\nrepeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and\nherself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the\nacquaintance.\nMrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham's desertion, and\ncomplimented her on bearing it so well.\n\"But, my dear Elizabeth,\" she added, \"what sort of girl is Miss King? I\nshould be sorry to think our friend mercenary.\"\n\"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,\nbetween the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,\nand avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,\nbecause it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a\ngirl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is\nmercenary.\"\n\"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know\nwhat to think.\"\n\"She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.\"\n\"But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather's death\nmade her mistress of this fortune?\"\n\"No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_\naffections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for\nmaking love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally\npoor?\"\n\"But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so\nsoon after this event.\"\n\"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant\ndecorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,\nwhy should _we_?\"\n\"_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being\ndeficient in something herself--sense or feeling.\"\n\"Well,\" cried Elizabeth, \"have it as you choose. _He_ shall be\nmercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.\"\n\"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,\nto think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.\"\n\"Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in\nDerbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not\nmuch better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow\nwhere I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has\nneither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones\nworth knowing, after all.\"\n\"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.\"\nBefore they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the\nunexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in\na tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.",

She is all affability and condescension, and I\ndoubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when\nservice is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will\ninclude you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she\nhonours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is\ncharming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to\nwalk home. Her Ladyship's carriage is regularly ordered for us. I\n_should_ say, one of her Ladyship's carriages, for she has several.\"\n\"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,\" added\nCharlotte, \"and a most attentive neighbour.\"\n\"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of\nwoman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.\"\nThe evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and\ntelling again what had been already written; and when it closed,\nElizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon\nCharlotte's degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,\nand composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it\nwas all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would\npass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious\ninterruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse\nwith Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.",

The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The\nother is Miss De Bourgh. Only look at her. She is quite a little\ncreature. Who would have thought she could be so thin and small!\"\n\"She is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all this wind.\nWhy does she not come in?\"\n\"Oh, Charlotte says she hardly ever does. It is the greatest of favours\nwhen Miss De Bourgh comes in.\"\n\"I like her appearance,\" said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. \"She\nlooks sickly and cross. Yes, she will do for him very well. She will\nmake him a very proper wife.\"\nMr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation\nwith the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth's high diversion, was\nstationed in the doorway, in earnest contemplation of the greatness\nbefore him, and constantly bowing whenever Miss De Bourgh looked that\nway.\nAt length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on, and\nthe others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw the two\ngirls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune, which\nCharlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked\nto dine at Rosings the next day.",

She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had\na few minutes' conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever\nprevailed on to get out.\nVery few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and\nnot many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;\nand till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings\nto be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many\nhours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,\nand nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during\nthese visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,\nand advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement\nof the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she\naccepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding\nout that Mrs. Collins's joints of meat were too large for her family.\nElizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the\ncommission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate\nin her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by\nMr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be\nquarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the\nvillage to settle their differences, silence their complaints, and scold\nthem into harmony and plenty.\n[Illustration:\n\"he never failed to inform them\"\n]\nThe entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;\nand, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one\ncard-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart\nof the first.

This,\nhowever, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time\ncomfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with\nCharlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she\nhad often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where\nshe frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was\nalong the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was\na nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and\nwhere she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine's curiosity.\nIn this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.",

Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy\nwas expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were\nnot many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would\nfurnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and\nshe might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley's designs on him\nwere, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined\nby Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest\nsatisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and\nseemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by\nMiss Lucas and herself.\nHis arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was walking\nthe whole morning within view of the lodges opening into Hunsford Lane,\nin order to have\n[Illustration:\n\"The gentlemen accompanied him.\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\nthe earliest assurance of it; and, after making his bow as the carriage\nturned into the park, hurried home with the great intelligence. On the\nfollowing morning he hastened to Rosings to pay his respects. There were\ntwo nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had brought\nwith him a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his uncle, Lord ----;\nand, to the great surprise of all the party, when Mr. Collins returned,\nthe gentlemen accompanied him. Charlotte had seen them from her\nhusband's room, crossing the road, and immediately running into the\nother, told the girls what an honour they might expect, adding,--\n\"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy would\nnever have come so soon to wait upon me.\"\nElizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment\nbefore their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly\nafterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,\nwho led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and\naddress most truly the gentleman. Mr. Darcy looked just as he had been\nused to look in Hertfordshire, paid his compliments, with his usual\nreserve, to Mrs. Collins; and whatever might be his feelings towards her\nfriend, met her with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth merely\ncourtesied to him, without saying a word.\nColonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the\nreadiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very pleasantly; but\nhis cousin, after having addressed a slight observation on the house and\ngarden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some time without speaking to anybody.\nAt length, however, his civility was so far awakened as to inquire of\nElizabeth after the health of her family. She answered him in the usual\nway; and, after a moment's pause, added,--\n\"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you never\nhappened to see her there?\"\nShe was perfectly sensible that he never had: but she wished to see\nwhether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the\nBingleys and Jane; and she thought he looked a little confused as he\nanswered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet Miss Bennet.

Her Ladyship received them\ncivilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so\nacceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,\nalmost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,\nmuch more than to any other person in the room.\nColonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a\nwelcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins's pretty friend had,\nmoreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and\ntalked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying\nat home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so\nwell entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much\nspirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as\nwell as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned\ntowards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a\nwhile, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not\nscruple to call out,--\n\"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking\nof? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.\"\n\"We were talking of music, madam,\" said he, when no longer able to avoid\na reply.\n\"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I\nmust have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.\nThere are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true\nenjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever\nlearnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her\nhealth had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have\nperformed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?\"\nMr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency.\n\"I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,\" said Lady\nCatherine; \"and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,\nif she does not practise a great deal.\"\n\"I assure you, madam,\" he replied, \"that she does not need such advice.\nShe practises very constantly.\"\n\"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write\nto her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often\ntell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without\nconstant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will\nnever play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.\nCollins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told\nher, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.\nJenkinson's room. She would be in nobody's way, you know, in that part\nof the house.\"\nMr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt's ill-breeding, and made\nno answer.\nWhen coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having\npromised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He\ndrew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then\ntalked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from\nher, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,\nstationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer's\ncountenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first\nconvenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--\n\"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear\nme. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.\nThere is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at\nthe will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to\nintimidate me.\"\n\"I shall not say that you are mistaken,\" he replied, \"because you could\nnot really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I\nhave had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you\nfind great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,\nare not your own.\"\nElizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to\nColonel Fitzwilliam, \"Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of\nme, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky\nin meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a\npart of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree\nof credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention\nall that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me\nleave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,\nand such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.\"\n\"I am not afraid of you,\" said he, smilingly.\n\"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him of,\" cried Colonel\nFitzwilliam. \"I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.\"\n\"You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The\nfirst time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at\na ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four\ndances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four\ndances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more\nthan one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,\nyou cannot deny the fact.\"\n\"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly\nbeyond my own party.\"\n\"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel\nFitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" said Darcy, \"I should have judged better had I sought an\nintroduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.\"\n\"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?\" said Elizabeth, still\naddressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. \"Shall we ask him why a man of sense and\neducation, and who has lived in the world, is ill-qualified to recommend\nhimself to strangers?\"\n\"I can answer your question,\" said Fitzwilliam, \"without applying to\nhim. It is because he will not give himself the trouble.\"\n\"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,\" said Darcy,\n\"of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot\ncatch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their\nconcerns, as I often see done.\"\n\"My fingers,\" said Elizabeth, \"do not move over this instrument in the\nmasterly manner which I see so many women's do. They have not the same\nforce or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I\nhave always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take\nthe trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers\nas capable as any other woman's of superior execution.\"\nDarcy smiled and said, \"You are perfectly right. You have employed your\ntime much better. No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can\nthink anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.\"\nHere they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know\nwhat they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.\nLady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said\nto Darcy,--\n\"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and\ncould have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion\nof fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne's. Anne would have\nbeen a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.\"\nElizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his\ncousin's praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she\ndiscern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss\nDe Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have\nbeen just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.\nLady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth's performance, mixing\nwith them many instructions on execution and taste. Elizabeth received\nthem with all the forbearance of civility; and at the request of the\ngentlemen remained at the instrument till her Ladyship's carriage was\nready to take them all home.",

It was absolutely\nnecessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency\nrecollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling\ncurious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty\ndeparture, she observed,--\n\"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!\nIt must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you\nall after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day\nbefore. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?\"\n\"Perfectly so, I thank you.\"\nShe found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short\npause, added,--\n\"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever\nreturning to Netherfield again?\"\n\"I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend\nvery little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is\nat a time of life when friends and engagements are continually\nincreasing.\"\n\"If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the\nneighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we\nmight possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did\nnot take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as\nfor his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same\nprinciple.\"\n\"I should not be surprised,\" said Darcy, \"if he were to give it up as\nsoon as any eligible purchase offers.\"\nElizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his\nfriend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the\ntrouble of finding a subject to him.\nHe took the hint and soon began with, \"This seems a very comfortable\nhouse. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.\nCollins first came to Hunsford.\"\n\"I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her\nkindness on a more grateful object.\"\n\"Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.\"\n\"Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of\nthe very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made\nhim happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though\nI am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest\nthing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a\nprudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.\"\n\"It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a\ndistance of her own family and friends.\"\n\"An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.\"\n\"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day's\njourney. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.\"\n\"I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_\nof the match,\" cried Elizabeth. \"I should never have said Mrs. Collins\nwas settled _near_ her family.\"\n\"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond\nthe very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.\"\nAs he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she\nunderstood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and\nNetherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--\n\"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her\nfamily. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many\nvarying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of\ntravelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the\ncase _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not\nsuch a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my\nfriend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_\nthe present distance.\"\nMr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, \"_You_ cannot\nhave a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have\nbeen always at Longbourn.\"\nElizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of\nfeeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,\nglancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--\n\"Are you pleased with Kent?\"\nA short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side\ncalm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte\nand her sister, just returned from their walk. The _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_\nsurprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his\nintruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,\nwithout saying much to anybody, went away.",

They called at various times of the morning, sometimes\nseparately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their\naunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he\nhad pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended\nhim still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in\nbeing with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former\nfavourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there\nwas less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam's manners, she\nbelieved he might have the best informed mind.\nBut why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult\nto understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there\nten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it\nseemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to\npropriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really\nanimated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel\nFitzwilliam's occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was\ngenerally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told\nher; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of\nlove, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself\nseriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at\nRosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He\ncertainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that\nlook was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often\ndoubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it\nseemed nothing but absence of mind.\nShe had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his\nbeing partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.\nCollins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of\nraising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her\nopinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend's dislike would\nvanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.\nIn her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying\nColonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he\ncertainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,\nto counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage\nin the church, and his cousin could have none at all.",

She felt all the perverseness of the\nmischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to\nprevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,\nthat it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,\ntherefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like\nwilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was\nnot merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,\nbut he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He\nnever said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking\nor of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third\nencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her\npleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her\nopinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins's happiness; and that in speaking of\nRosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to\nexpect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying\n_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel\nFitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must\nmean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her\na little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the\npales opposite the Parsonage.",

He\narranges the business just as he pleases.\"\n\"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\ngreat pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\nmore to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.\"\n\"He likes to have his own way very well,\" replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n\"But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\nmany others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\nfeelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\ndependence.\"\n\"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\neither. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\ndependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\nwherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?\"\n\"These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\nexperienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\nweight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\nwhere they like.\"\n\"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\ndo.\"\n\"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in\nmy rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\nmoney.\"\n\"Is this,\" thought Elizabeth, \"meant for me?\" and she coloured at the\nidea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, \"And pray, what is\nthe usual price of an earl's younger son? Unless the elder brother is\nvery sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.\"\nHe answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\na silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\nshe soon afterwards said,--\n\"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\nhaving somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\nlasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\nfor the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\nlikes with her.\"\n\"No,\" said Colonel Fitzwilliam, \"that is an advantage which he must\ndivide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.\"\n\"Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\nyour charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\na little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\nmay like to have her own way.\"\nAs she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\nin which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\ngive them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\ngot pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\n\"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\nsay she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\nvery great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\nMiss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.\"\n\"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\nman--he is a great friend of Darcy's.\"\n\"Oh yes,\" said Elizabeth drily--\"Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\nBingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.\"\n\"Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\nthose points where he most wants care. From something that he told me\nin our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\nto him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\nthat Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.\"\n\"What is it you mean?\"\n\"It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\ngenerally known, because if it were to get round to the lady's family it\nwould be an unpleasant thing.\"\n\"You may depend upon my not mentioning it.\"\n\"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\nBingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\non having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\nimprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\nparticulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\nthe kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\nknowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.\"\n\"Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?\"\n\"I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\nlady.\"\n\"And what arts did he use to separate them?\"\n\"He did not talk to me of his own arts,\" said Fitzwilliam, smiling. \"He\nonly told me what I have now told you.\"\nElizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\nindignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\nwas so thoughtful.\n\"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,\" said she. \"Your\ncousin's conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\njudge?\"\n\"You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?\"\n\"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\nfriend's inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\ndetermine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,\"\nshe continued, recollecting herself, \"as we know none of the\nparticulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\nthat there was much affection in the case.\"\n\"That is not an unnatural surmise,\" said Fitzwilliam; \"but it is\nlessening the honour of my cousin's triumph very sadly.\"\nThis was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\nMr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\ntherefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\nmatters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,",

If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\nJane had suffered, and still continued to suffer.

They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\nrevival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\nBut in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\ncheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\nproceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\ndisposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\nnoticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\nattention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy's\nshameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\nkeener sense of her sister's sufferings. It was some consolation to\nthink that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\nand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\nwith Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\nspirits, by all that affection could do.",

But\nthis idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\naffected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\nroom. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\nhealth, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\nShe answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\nthen getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\nsaid not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\nin an agitated manner, and thus began:--\n\"In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\nrepressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\nyou.\"\nElizabeth's astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\ndoubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\nand the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\nfollowed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\nheart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\ntenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\ndegradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\nto inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\nconsequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\nsuit.\nIn spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\nthe compliment of such a man's affection, and though her intentions did\nnot vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\nreceive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\nall compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\nanswer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\nrepresenting to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\nall his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\nexpressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\nhis hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\nfavourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\ncountenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\nexasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\nand she said,--\n\"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\nexpress a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\nunequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\nfelt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\ncannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\nbestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to",

The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\nthe acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\novercoming it after this explanation.\"\nMr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\non her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\nsurprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\nhis mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\nappearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\nhimself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth's feelings\ndreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\n\"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\nmight, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\ncivility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.\"\n\"I might as well inquire,\" replied she, \"why, with so evident a design\nof offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\nagainst your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\nWas not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\nother provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\nagainst you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\nfavourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\nthe man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\nhappiness of a most beloved sister?\"\nAs she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\nwas short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\ncontinued,--\n\"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\nexcuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\nyou cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\nof dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\nworld for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\ndisappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\nkind.\"\nShe paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\nwith an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\nHe even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n\"Can you deny that you have done it?\" she repeated.\nWith assumed tranquillity he then replied, \"I have no wish of denying\nthat I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\nsister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\nkinder than towards myself.\"\nElizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\nbut its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n\"But it is not merely this affair,\" she continued, \"on which my dislike\nis founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\ndecided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\nmany months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\nsay? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\nor under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?\"\n\"You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns,\" said Darcy,\nin a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n\"Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\ninterest in him?\"\n\"His misfortunes!\" repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--\"yes, his\nmisfortunes have been great indeed.\"\n\"And of your infliction,\" cried Elizabeth, with energy; \"You have\nreduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\nhave withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\nfor him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\nindependence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\nall this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\ncontempt and ridicule.\"\n\"And this,\" cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n\"is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\nthank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\ncalculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,\" added he, stopping in his\nwalk, and turning towards her, \"these offences might have been\noverlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\nscruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\nbitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\npolicy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\nbeing impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\nreflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\nNor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\nCould you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\nconnections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\ncondition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?\"\nElizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\nthe utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\n\"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\ndeclaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\nconcern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\nmore gentlemanlike manner.\"\nShe saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\n\"You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\nthat would have tempted me to accept it.\"\nAgain his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\nexpression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\n\"From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\nacquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\nbelief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\nfeelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\ndisapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\ndislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\nlast man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\"\n\"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\nfeelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\nForgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\nwishes for your health and happiness.\"",

She could not yet recover from the\nsurprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\nelse; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\nbreakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\ndirectly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy's\nsometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\nshe turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\npark paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\nof the gates into the ground.\nAfter walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\ntempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\nlook into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\nmade a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\nverdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\nwalk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\nwhich edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\nMr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\nnow near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\npronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\nthough in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\ntowards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\na letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\ncomposure, \"I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\nmeeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?\" and\nthen, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\nout of sight.",

            "text": "With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\nElizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\nperceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\nquite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\nfull. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\nfrom Rosings, at eight o'clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n\"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\nits containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\noffers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\nintention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\nwhich, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\neffort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\nshould have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\nand read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\nyour attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\ndemand it of your justice.\n\"Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\nmagnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\nthat, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\nfrom your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\nclaims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\nprosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\nwantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\nfavourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\ndependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\nits exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\npersons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\nbear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\nnight so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\nto be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\ntheir motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\nto myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\noffensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\nbe obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\nHertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\npreferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\nit was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\napprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\nin love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\nyou, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas's accidental\ninformation, that Bingley's attentions to your sister had given rise to\na general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\nevent, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\nobserved my friend's behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\nthat his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\nin him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\ncheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\nregard; and I remained convinced, from the evening's scrutiny, that\nthough she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\nthem by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\nhere, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\nsister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\nby such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\nunreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\nyour sister's countenance and air was such as might have given the most\nacute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\nwas not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\nher indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\ninvestigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\nfears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\nbelieved it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\nMy objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\nacknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\nin my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\nmy friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\nwhich, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\ninstances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\nimmediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\nsituation of your mother's family, though objectionable, was nothing in\ncomparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\nuniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\noccasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\nyou. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\nand your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\nconsolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\nany share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\nyou and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\ndisposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\nthat evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\ninducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\nfriend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\nNetherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\nremember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\nnow to be explained. His sisters' uneasiness had been equally excited\nwith my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\nsensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\nshortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\nwent--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\nfriend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\nearnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\nhis determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\nprevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\nI hesitated not in giving, of your sister's indifference. He had before\nbelieved her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\nregard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\ndependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\nthat he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\nhim against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\ngiven, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\nhaving done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\naffair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\ncondescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\nyour sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\nBingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\nhave met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\ndid not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\ndanger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\ndone, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\nnothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\nsister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\ngoverned me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\nyet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\naccusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\nlaying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\nhas _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\nshall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\nMr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\nthe management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\nthe discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\nto him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\ntherefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\nafterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\nalways poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\ngive him a gentleman's education. My father was not only fond of this\nyoung man's society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\nhighest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\nintended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\nsince I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\nvicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\nguard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\nobservation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\nhad opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\ncould not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\nonly can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\ncreated, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\nhis real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\ndied about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\nlast so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\npromote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\nallow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\nmight be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\none thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\nwithin half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\nthat, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\nnot think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\npecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\nbenefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\nmust be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\ninsufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\nsincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\nproposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\nbusiness was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\nin the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\nreceive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\nbetween us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\nto Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\nchiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\nnow free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\ndissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\ndecease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\nhe applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\ncircumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\nwere exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\nand was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\nhim to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\ndoubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\nand I could not have forgotten my revered father's intentions. You will\nhardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\nresisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\nthe distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\nhis abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\nperiod, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\nknow not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\nnotice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\nmyself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\nto unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\nyour secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\nto the guardianship of my mother's nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\nmyself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\nestablishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\nthe lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\nWickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\nacquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\nmost unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\nrecommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\nstrong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\npersuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\nwas then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\nimprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\nherself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\nelopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\nand offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\nacknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\nacted. Regard for my sister's credit and feelings prevented any public\nexposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\nand Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham's\nchief object was unquestionably my sister's fortune, which is thirty\nthousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\nhimself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\ncomplete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\nwhich we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\nreject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\ntowards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\nfalsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\nwondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\neither. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\nnot in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\ntold you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\nwhat could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\nrelated, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\nFitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\nstill more as one of the executors of my father's will, has been\nunavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\nyour abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you\ncannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and\nthat there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour\nto find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\ncourse of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\n\"FITZWILLIAM DARCY.\"",

With amazement did\nshe first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\nand steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to\ngive, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\nprejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of\nwhat had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which\nhardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing\nwhat the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\nsense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister's\ninsensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the\nreal, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any\nwish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done\nwhich satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all\npride and insolence.\nBut when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\nshe read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,\nif true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\nbore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings\nwere yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\nAstonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her.

            "text": "In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\nnothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter\nwas unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she\nagain began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\ncommanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\nThe account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly\nwhat he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\nthough she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\nown words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to\nthe will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\nwas fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was\nimpossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\nother, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\nnot err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the\nparticulars immediately following of Wickham's resigning all pretensions\nto the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\nthousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\nletter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\nimpartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\nlittle success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\nBut every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\nbelieved it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\nrender Mr. Darcy's conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\nturn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\nThe extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\nMr. Wickham's charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\nbring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\nentrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the\npersuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\nhad there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\nnothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told\n[Illustration:\n\"Meeting accidentally in Town\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\nhimself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,\nshe had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and\nmanner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\nShe tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\ntrait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\nattacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone\nfor those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what\nMr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years'\ncontinuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\ninstantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could\nremember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the\nneighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\nthe mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\nmore continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his\ndesigns on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed\nbetween Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at\nlast she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\nFitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the\ninformation of his near concern in all his cousin's affairs and whose\ncharacter she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost\nresolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness\nof the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\nMr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been\nwell assured of his cousin's corroboration.\nShe perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation",

            "text": "between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips's.\nMany of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\nstruck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\nwondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\nhimself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\nwith his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\nof seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\nthe very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield\nfamily had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\nherself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;\nthat he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy's\ncharacter, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\nalways prevent his exposing the son.\nHow differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His\nattentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\nhatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\nthe moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\nHis behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had\neither been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\nhis vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\nincautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\nand fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\nbut allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\nasserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\nwere his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\nacquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\ntogether, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\nthat betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\nof irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\nesteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\nbrother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\nsister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his\nactions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\neverything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\nthat friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\nas Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.\nShe grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\ncould she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\nprejudiced, absurd.\n\"How despicably have I acted!\" she cried. \"I, who have prided myself on\nmy discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\noften disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\nvanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this\ndiscovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not\nhave been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\nfolly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\nof the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\nprepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\nconcerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.\"\nFrom herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\nwhich soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy's explanation\n_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\ndifferent was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\ncredit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\ngive in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious\nof her sister's attachment; and she could not help remembering what\nCharlotte's opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice\nof his description of Jane. She felt that Jane's feelings, though\nfervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\ncomplacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\nsensibility.\nWhen she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\nmentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense\nof shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\nfor denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\nhaving passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\ndisapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\nthan on hers.\nThe compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but\nit could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\nself-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that\nJane's disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest\nrelations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\nby such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\nhad ever known before.",

But I am particularly\nattached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!\nThey were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear\nColonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\nseemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His\nattachment to Rosings certainly increases.\"\nMr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which\nwere kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\nLady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\nspirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\nshe did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--\n\"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\nmay stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\ncompany, I am sure.\"\n\"I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,\" replied\nElizabeth; \"but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\nnext Saturday.\"\n\"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\nyou to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\ncan be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\nspare you for another fortnight.\"\n\"But my father cannot. He wrote last week to hurry my return.\"\n[Illustration:\n\"Dawson\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n\"Oh, your father, of course, may spare you, if your mother can.\nDaughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if you will\nstay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to take one of you\nas far as London, for I am going there early in June, for a week; and\nas Dawson does not object to the barouche-box, there will be very good\nroom for one of you--and, indeed, if the weather should happen to be\ncool, I should not object to taking you both, as you are neither of you\nlarge.\"\n\"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our\noriginal plan.\"\nLady Catherine seemed resigned. \"Mrs. Collins, you must send a servant\nwith them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot bear the idea\nof two young women travelling post by themselves. It is highly improper.\nYou must contrive to send somebody. I have the greatest dislike in the\nworld to that sort of thing. Young women should always be properly\nguarded and attended, according to their situation in life. When my\nniece Georgiana went to Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her\nhaving two men-servants go with her. Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr.\nDarcy of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with\npropriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to all those\nthings. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs. Collins. I am\nglad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would really be\ndiscreditable to _you_ to let them go alone.\"",

Where shall you change horses?\nOh, Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at the Bell, you will be\nattended to.\"\nLady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey;\nand as she did not answer them all herself attention was\nnecessary--which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her; or, with a\nmind so occupied, she might have forgotten where she was. Reflection\nmust be reserved for solitary hours: whenever she was alone, she gave\nway to it as the greatest relief; and not a day went by without a\nsolitary walk, in which she might indulge in all the delight of\nunpleasant recollections.\nMr. Darcy's letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart. She\nstudied every sentence; and her feelings towards its writer were at\ntimes widely different. When she remembered the style of his address,\nshe was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly\nshe had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against\nherself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.\nHis attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she\ncould not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or\nfeel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past\nbehaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in\nthe unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.\nThey were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at\nthem, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his\nyoungest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right\nherself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently\nunited with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine\nand Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother's indulgence,\nwhat chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,\nirritable, and completely under Lydia's guidance, had been always\naffronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would\nscarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While\nthere was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while\nMeryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for\never.\nAnxiety on Jane's behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy's\nexplanation, by restoring Bingley to all her former good opinion,\nheightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to\nhave been sincere, and his conduct cleared of all blame, unless any\ncould attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How\ngrievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every\nrespect, so replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had\nbeen deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!\nWhen to these recollections was added the development of Wickham's\ncharacter, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had\nseldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it\nalmost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.",

I do not think it\nis very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall\npull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any\nbetter.\"\nAnd when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect\nunconcern, \"Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and\nwhen I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I\nthink it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what\none wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they\nare going in a fortnight.\"\n\"Are they, indeed?\" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.\n\"They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to\ntake us all there for the summer!

I dare say he often hears worse\nthings said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad\nhe is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for\nmy news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?\nThere is no danger of Wickham's marrying Mary King--there's for you! She\nis gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.\"\n\"And Mary King is safe!\" added Elizabeth; \"safe from a connection\nimprudent as to fortune.\"\n\"She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.\"\n\"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,\" said Jane.\n\"I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared\nthree straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled\nthing?\"\nElizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such\ncoarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_\nwas little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied\nliberal!\nAs soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was\nordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their\nboxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty's and\nLydia's purchases, were seated in it.\n\"How nicely we are crammed in!\" cried Lydia. \"I am glad I brought my\nbonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now\nlet us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way\nhome. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all\nsince you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any\nflirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband\nbefore you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.\nShe is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not\nbeing married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to\nget husbands you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.\nCollins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!\nhow I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would\n_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece\nof fun the other day at Colonel Forster's! Kitty and me were to spend\nthe day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the\nevening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so\nshe asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen\nwas forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We\ndressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for a\nlady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.\nForster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow\none of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,\nand Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they\ndid not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.\nForster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect\nsomething, and then they soon found out what was the matter.\"\nWith such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,\nassisted by Kitty's hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her\ncompanions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she\ncould, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham's name.",

Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane\nin undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet\nsay voluntarily to Elizabeth,----\n\"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.\"\nTheir party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases\ncame to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects\nwhich occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the\ntable, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet\nwas doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present\nfashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,\nretailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice\nrather louder than any other person's, was enumerating the various\npleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.\n\"Oh, Mary,\" said she, \"I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!\nas we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended\nthere was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if\nKitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we\nbehaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest\ncold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have\ntreated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought\nwe never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.\nAnd then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so\nloud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!\"\nTo this, Mary very gravely replied, \"Far be it from me, my dear sister,\nto depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the\ngenerality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for\n_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.\"\nBut of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to\nanybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.\nIn the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to\nMeryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed\nthe scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at\nhome half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was\nanother reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham\nagain, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to\n_her_, of the regiment's approaching removal, was indeed beyond\nexpression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped\nthere could be nothing more to plague her on his account.\nShe had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton\nscheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under\nfrequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her\nfather had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were\nat the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often\ndisheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.",

            "text": "Elizabeth's impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no\nlonger be overcome; and at length resolving to suppress every particular\nin which her sister was concerned, and preparing her to be surprised,\nshe related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr.\nDarcy and herself.\nMiss Bennet's astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly\npartiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly\nnatural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was\nsorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so\nlittle suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the\nunhappiness which her sister's refusal must have given him.\n\"His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,\" said she, \"and certainly\nought not to have appeared; but consider how much it must increase his\ndisappointment.\"\n\"Indeed,\" replied Elizabeth, \"I am heartily sorry for him; but he has\nother feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me.\nYou do not blame me, however, for refusing him?\"\n\"Blame you! Oh, no.\"\n\"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?\"\n\"No--I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did.\"\n\"But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very\nnext day.\"\nShe then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far\nas they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,\nwho would willingly have gone through the world without believing that\nso much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here\ncollected in one individual! Nor was Darcy's vindication, though\ngrateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.\nMost earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and\nseek to clear one, without involving the other.\n\"This will not do,\" said Elizabeth; \"you never will be able to make both\nof them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied\nwith only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just\nenough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting\nabout pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.\nDarcy's, but you shall do as you choose.\"\nIt was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from Jane.\n\"I do not know when I have been more shocked,\" said she. \"Wickham so\nvery bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! dear Lizzy,\nonly consider what he must have suffered. Such a disappointment! and\nwith the knowledge of your ill opinion too! and having to relate such a\nthing of his sister! It is really too distressing, I am sure you must\nfeel it so.\"\n\"Oh no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full\nof both. I know you will do him such ample justice, that I am growing\nevery moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your profusion makes me\nsaving; and if you lament over him much longer, my heart will be as\nlight as a feather.\"\n\"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his\ncountenance! such an openness and gentleness in his manner.\"\n\"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of those\ntwo young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other all the\nappearance of it.\"\n\"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it as you\nused to do.\"\n\"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike\nto him, without any reason. It is such a spur to one's genius, such an\nopening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind. One may be continually\nabusive without saying anything just; but one cannot be always laughing\nat a man without now and then stumbling on something witty.\"\n\"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not treat\nthe matter as you do now.\"\n\"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I was very\nuncomfortable--I may say unhappy. And with no one to speak to of what I\nfelt, no Jane to comfort me, and say that I had not been so very weak,\nand vain, and nonsensical, as I knew I had! Oh, how I wanted you!\"\n\"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong expressions\nin speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they _do_ appear wholly\nundeserved.\"\n\"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most\nnatural consequence of the prejudices I had been encouraging. There is\none point on which I want your advice. I want to be told whether I\nought, or ought not, to make our acquaintance in general understand\nWickham's character.\"\nMiss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, \"Surely there can be no\noccasion for exposing him so dreadfully. What is your own opinion?\"\n\"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to\nmake his communication public. On the contrary, every particular\nrelative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to\nmyself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his\nconduct, who will believe me? The general prejudice against Mr. Darcy is\nso violent, that it would be the death of half the good people in\nMeryton, to attempt to place him in an amiable light. I am not equal to\nit. Wickham will soon be gone; and, therefore, it will not signify to\nanybody here what he really is. Some time hence it will be all found\nout, and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before.\nAt present I will say nothing about it.\"\n\"You are quite right. To have his errors made public might ruin him for\never. He is now, perhaps, sorry for what he has done, and anxious to\nre-establish a character. We must not make him desperate.\"\nThe tumult of Elizabeth's mind was allayed by this conversation. She\nhad got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a\nfortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane, whenever she\nmight wish to talk again of either. But there was still something\nlurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not\nrelate the other half of Mr. Darcy's letter, nor explain to her sister\nhow sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in\nwhich no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than\na perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in\nthrowing off this last encumbrance of mystery. \"And then,\" said she, \"if\nthat very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely be\nable to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner\nhimself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost\nall its value!\"",

            "text": "The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was\nthe last of the regiment's stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in\nthe neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost\nuniversal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,\nand sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very\nfrequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and\nLydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such\nhard-heartedness in any of the family.\n\"Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?\" would they\noften exclaim in the bitterness of woe. \"How can you be smiling so,\nLizzy?\"\nTheir affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what\nshe had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.\n\"I am sure,\" said she, \"I cried for two days together when Colonel\nMiller's regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.\"\n\"I am sure I shall break _mine_,\" said Lydia.\n\"If one could but go to Brighton!\" observed Mrs. Bennet.\n\"Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.\"\n\"A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.\"\n\"And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,\"\nadded Kitty.\nSuch were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through\nLongbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense\nof pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy's\nobjections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his\ninterference in the views of his friend.\nBut the gloom of Lydia's prospect was shortly cleared away; for she\nreceived an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the\nregiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a\nvery young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour\nand good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of\ntheir _three_ months' acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.\nThe rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,\nthe delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely\nto be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister's feelings, Lydia flew\nabout the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone's\ncongratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;\nwhilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate\nin terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.",

            "text": "Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been\nfrequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty\nwell over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even\nlearnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,\nan affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present\nbehaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;\nfor the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which\nhad marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after\nwhat had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in\nfinding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous\ngallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the\nreproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever\ncause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,\nand her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.\nOn the very last day of the regiment's remaining in Meryton, he dined,\nwith others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth\ndisposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some\ninquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she\nmentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam's and Mr. Darcy's having both spent three\nweeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.\nHe looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment's\nrecollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen\nhim often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,\nasked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.\nWith an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, \"How long did you\nsay that he was at Rosings?\"\n\"Nearly three weeks.\"\n\"And you saw him frequently?\"\n\"Yes, almost every day.\"\n\"His manners are very different from his cousin's.\"\n\"Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.\"\n\"Indeed!\" cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. \"And pray\nmay I ask--\" but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, \"Is it in\naddress that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his\nordinary style? for I dare not hope,\" he continued, in a lower and more\nserious tone, \"that he is improved in essentials.\"\n\"Oh, no!\" said Elizabeth. \"In essentials, I believe, he is very much\nwhat he ever was.\"\nWhile she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to\nrejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a\nsomething in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive\nand anxious attention, while she added,--\n\"When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that\neither his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,\nfrom knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.\"\nWickham's alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated\nlook; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his\nembarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of\naccents,--\n\"You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily\ncomprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume\neven the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,\nmay be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter\nhim from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that\nthe sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is\nmerely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and\njudgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I\nknow, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his\nwish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he\nhas very much at heart.\"\nElizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a\nslight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on\nthe old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge\nhim. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,\nof usual cheerfulness, but with no further attempt to distinguish\nElizabeth; and they parted at last with mutual civility, and possibly a\nmutual desire of never meeting again.",

Respect,\nesteem, and confidence had vanished for ever; and all his views of\ndomestic happiness were overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a\ndisposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own\nimprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often\nconsole the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of\nthe country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his principal\nenjoyments.

She had always seen it with pain; but\nrespecting his abilities, and grateful for his affectionate treatment of\nherself, she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook, and to\nbanish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation\nand decorum which, in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own\nchildren, was so highly reprehensible. But she had never felt so\nstrongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so\nunsuitable a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising\nfrom so ill-judged a direction of talents--talents which, rightly used,\nmight at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters, even\nif incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife.",

A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her\nalarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of\ncuriosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the\nnext morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and\nwith a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike\nto the scheme.",

She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been\nmistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the\nhall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to\nwonder at her being where she was.\nThe housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less\nfine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They\nfollowed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned\nroom, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went\nto a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from\nwhich they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the\ndistance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was\ngood; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered\non its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace\nit, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were\ntaking different positions; but from every window there were beauties\nto be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture\nsuitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with\nadmiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly\nfine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the\nfurniture of Rosings.\n\"And of this place,\" thought she, \"I might have been mistress! With\nthese rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of\nviewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and\nwelcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,\" recollecting\nherself, \"that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to\nme; I should not have been allowed to invite them.\"\nThis was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.\nShe longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really\nabsent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was\nasked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds\nreplied, that he was; adding, \"But we expect him to-morrow, with a large\nparty of friends.\" How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had\nnot by any circumstance been delayed a day!\nHer aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw\nthe likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other\nminiatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how\nshe liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the\npicture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master's steward, who\nhad been brought up by him at his own expense. \"He is now gone into the\narmy,\" she added; \"but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.\"\nMrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not\nreturn it.\n\"And that,\" said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,\n\"is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the\nother--about eight years ago.\"\n\"I have heard much of your master's fine person,\" said Mrs. Gardiner,\nlooking at the picture; \"it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell\nus whether it is like or not.\"\nMrs. Reynolds' respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this\nintimation of her knowing her master.\n\"Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?\"\nElizabeth coloured, and said, \"A little.\"\n\"And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma'am?\"\n\"Yes, very handsome.\"\n\"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you\nwill see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late\nmaster's favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to\nbe then. He was very fond of them.\"\nThis accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham's being among them.\nMrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn\nwhen she was only eight years old.\n\"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?\" said Mr. Gardiner.\n\"Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so\naccomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a\nnew instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she\ncomes here to-morrow with him.\"\nMr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her\ncommunicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either\nfrom pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her\nmaster and his sister.\n\"Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?\"\n\"Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his\ntime here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.\"\n\"Except,\" thought Elizabeth, \"when she goes to Ramsgate.\"\n\"If your master would marry, you might see more of him.\"\n\"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is\ngood enough for him.\"\nMr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, \"It is\nvery much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.\"\n\"I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows\nhim,\" replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;\nand she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,\n\"I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him\never since he was four years old.\"\nThis was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her\nideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.\nHer keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was\ngrateful to her uncle for saying,--\n\"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in\nhaving such a master.\"\n\"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not\nmeet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are\ngood-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he\nwas always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the\nworld.\"\nElizabeth almost stared at her. \"Can this be Mr. Darcy?\" thought she.\n\"His father was an excellent man,\" said Mrs. Gardiner.\n\"Yes, ma'am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just\nas affable to the poor.\"\nElizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.\nReynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects\nof the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the\nfurniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family\nprejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her\nmaster, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his\nmany merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.\n\"He is the best landlord, and the best master,\" said she, \"that ever\nlived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but\nthemselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will\ngive him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never\nsaw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle\naway like other young men.\"\n\"In what an amiable light does this place him!\" thought Elizabeth.\n\"This fine account of him,\" whispered her aunt as they walked, \"is not\nquite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.\"\n\"Perhaps we might be deceived.\"\n\"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.\"\nOn reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty\nsitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than\nthe apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to\ngive pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when\nlast at Pemberley.\n\"He is certainly a good brother,\" said Elizabeth, as she walked towards\none of the windows.\nMrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy's delight, when she should enter\nthe room. \"And this is always the way with him,\" she added. \"Whatever\ncan give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There\nis nothing he would not do for her.\"\nThe picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were\nall that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:\nbut Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already\nvisible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss\nDarcy's, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and\nalso more intelligible.\nIn the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have\nlittle to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest\nof the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it\narrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with\nsuch a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,\nwhen he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in\nearnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the\ngallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his\nfather's lifetime.\nThere was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth's mind, a more gentle\nsensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of\ntheir acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds\nwas of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise\nof an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she\nconsidered how many people's happiness were in his guardianship! How\nmuch of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good\nor evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by\nthe housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before\nthe canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon\nherself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude\nthan it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened\nits impropriety of expression.\nWhen all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,\nthey returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were\nconsigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.",

            "text": "As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back\nto look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was\nconjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself\nsuddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.\nThey were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his\nappearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes\ninstantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest\nblush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from\nsurprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,\nand spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least\nof perfect civility.\nShe had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,\nreceived his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be\novercome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture\nthey had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two\nthat they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener's expression of surprise, on\nbeholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little\naloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,\nscarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she\nreturned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the\nalteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he\nuttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the\nimpropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few\nminutes in which they continued together were some of the most\nuncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he\nspoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his\ninquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay\nin Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the\ndistraction of his thoughts.\nAt length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few\nmoments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took\nleave.\nThe others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his\nfigure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own\nfeelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and\nvexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged\nthing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a\ndisgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if\nshe had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?\nor, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been\nonly ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his\ndiscrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that\nmoment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and\nagain over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so\nstrikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to\nher was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her\nfamily! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,\nnever had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.\nWhat a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when\nhe put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to\naccount for it.\nThey had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and\nevery step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer\nreach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time\nbefore Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered\nmechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed\nto direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she\ndistinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that\none spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then\nwas. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in\nwhat manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,\nshe was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he\nfelt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was\nnot like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing\nher, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with\ncomposure.\nAt length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind\nroused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.\nThey entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,\nascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening\nof the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of\nthe valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods\noverspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner\nexpressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be\nbeyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten\nmiles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed\ncircuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among\nhanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.\nThey crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of\nthe scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and\nthe valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the\nstream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered\nit. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed\nthe bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,\nwho was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of\nreturning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,\ntherefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house\non the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their\nprogress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the\ntaste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the\noccasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man\nabout them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this\nslow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth's astonishment was\nquite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy\napproaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less\nsheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they\nmet. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an\ninterview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with\ncalmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,\nshe felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea\nlasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the\nturning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that\nhe had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,\nshe began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not\ngot beyond the words \"delightful,\" and \"charming,\" when some unlucky\nrecollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from\nher might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said\nno more.\nMrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked\nher if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.\nThis was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and\nshe could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the\nacquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had\nrevolted, in his offer to herself. \"What will be his surprise,\" thought\nshe, \"when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of\nfashion.\"\nThe introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their\nrelationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore\nit; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he\ncould from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the\nconnection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,\nso far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into\nconversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,\ncould not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some\nrelations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most\nattentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every\nexpression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,\nhis taste, or his good manners.\nThe conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy\ninvite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he\nchose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same\ntime to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of\nthe stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was\nwalking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her\nwonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the\ncompliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was\nextreme; and continually was she repeating, \"Why is he so altered? From\nwhat can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake\nthat his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not\nwork such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love\nme.\"\nAfter walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two\ngentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the\nbrink of the river for the better inspection of some curious\nwater-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in\nMrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found\nElizabeth's arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred\nher husband's. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on\ntogether. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to\nknow that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the\nplace, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been\nvery unexpected--\"for your housekeeper,\" she added, \"informed us that\nyou would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we\nleft Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in\nthe country.\" He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that\nbusiness with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours\nbefore the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. \"They\nwill join me early to-morrow,\" he continued, \"and among them are some\nwho will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.\"\nElizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly\ndriven back to the time when Mr. Bingley's name had been last mentioned\nbetween them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was\nnot very differently engaged.\n\"There is also one other person in the party,\" he continued after a\npause, \"who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow\nme, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance\nduring your stay at Lambton?\"\nThe surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great\nfor her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt\nthat whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,\nmust be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was\nsatisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made\nhim think really ill of her.\nThey now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth\nwas not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and\npleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of\nthe highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had\nreached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a\nmile behind.\nHe then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not\ntired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might\nhave been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but\nthere seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that\nshe had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with\ngreat perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience\nand her ideas were nearly worn out before the _t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate_ was over.\nOn Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner's coming up they were all pressed to go into\nthe house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they\nparted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the\nladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him\nwalking slowly towards the house.",

I can now\nsay with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,\n_I_ have seen nothing of it.\"\n\"I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more\nthan civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such\nattention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.\"\n\"To be sure, Lizzy,\" said her aunt, \"he is not so handsome as Wickham;\nor rather he has not Wickham's countenance, for his features are\nperfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so\ndisagreeable?\"\nElizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked\nhim better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never\nseen him so pleasant as this morning.\n\"But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,\" replied\nher uncle. \"Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him\nat his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and\nwarn me off his grounds.\"\nElizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said\nnothing.\n\"From what we have seen of him,\" continued Mrs. Gardiner, \"I really\nshould not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by\nanybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.\nOn the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he\nspeaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would\nnot give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the\ngood lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!\nI could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal\nmaster, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends\nevery virtue.\"\nElizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of\nhis behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as\nguarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his\nrelations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different\nconstruction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor\nWickham's so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In\nconfirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary\ntransactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming\nher authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.\nMrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now\napproaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to\nthe charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out\nto her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of\nanything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning's walk, they had\nno sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former\nacquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an\nintercourse renewed after many years' discontinuance.\nThe occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth\nmuch attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing\nbut think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy's civility, and, above\nall, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.\n[Illustration]",

She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good-will which could not be\noverlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and\nwithout any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,\nwhere their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good\nopinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such\na change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as\nsuch, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no\nmeans unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,\nshe esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.\nIt had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that\nsuch a striking civility as Miss Darcy's, in coming to them on the very\nday of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late\nbreakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by\nsome exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it\nwould be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following\nmorning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when\nshe asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.",

Its windows,\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil, but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she\nfeared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\nBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\ninquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.",

            "text": "While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether\nshe most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the\nfeelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but\na moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to\nregret that he came.\nHe had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other\ngentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him\nonly on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to\nGeorgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive\ncuriosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley's, in spite of the\nsmiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its\nobjects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions\nto Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother's\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name: but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy's opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies\nand absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with\nthat corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's\nmeditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy\nwas possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections\nher brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.\nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more and more cheerfully.\nTheir visit did not continue long after the question and answer above\nmentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,",

When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help\nrepeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.\n\"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she cried: \"I\nnever in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.\"\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could see\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.\"\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,--\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\na beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time.\"\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\nwas only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.",

Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\nuncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\nthemselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a\nmost unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be\nassured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.\nAn express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,\nfrom Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland\nwith one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our\nsurprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am\nvery, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing\nto hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.\nThoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and\nlet us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is\ndisinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.\nOur poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How\nthankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against\nhim; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about\ntwelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have\npassed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect\nhim here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of\ntheir intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor\nmother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly\nknow what I have written.\"",

Dearest\nLizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,\nand it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham\nand our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has\ntaken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone\nto Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the\nday before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna\nGreen, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.\nnever intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated\nto Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,\nintending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but\nno farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a\nhackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.\nAll that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the\nLondon road. I know not what to think. After making every possible\ninquiry on that side of London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,\nanxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet\nand Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to\npass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and\nbroke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.\nI am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any\nblame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and\nmother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many\ncircumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married\nprivately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_\ncould form such a design against a young woman of Lydia's connections,\nwhich is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?\nImpossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed\nto depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my\nhopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother\nis really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be\nbetter, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in\nmy life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\nsomething of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is\nover, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,\nhowever, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen\nagain to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances\nare such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as\nsoon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not\nafraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of\nthe former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,\nto try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but\nhis excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the\nbest and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton\nagain to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and\nassistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"",

            "text": "\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and\nimpetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself\nenough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\nI must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;\nI have not an instant to lose.\"\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute;\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\nnot well enough; you cannot go yourself.\"\nElizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\naccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\nmistress home instantly.\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,\nor to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,\n\"Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you\npresent relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.\"\n\"No, I thank you,\" she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. \"There\nis nothing the matter with me. I am quite well, I am only distressed by\nsome dreadful news which I have just received from Longbourn.\"\nShe burst into tears as she alluded to it, and for a few minutes could\nnot speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could only say\nsomething indistinctly of his\n[Illustration:\n\"I have not an instant to lose\"\n]\nconcern, and observe her in compassionate silence. At length she spoke\nagain. \"I have just had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It\ncannot be concealed from anyone. My youngest sister has left all her\nfriends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.\nWickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too\nwell to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that\ncan tempt him to--she is lost for ever.\"\nDarcy was fixed in astonishment.\n\"When I consider,\" she added, in a yet more agitated voice, \"that _I_\nmight have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained\nsome part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had\nhis character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,\nall too late now.\"\n\"I am grieved, indeed,\" cried Darcy: \"grieved--shocked. But is it\ncertain, absolutely certain?\"\n\"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced\nalmost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to\nScotland.\"\n\"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?\"\n\"My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle's\nimmediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But\nnothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is\nsuch a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have\nnot the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!\"\nDarcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.\n\"When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what\nI ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\nmuch. Wretched, wretched mistake!\"\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\nwas sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\nwonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--\n\"I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything\nto plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.\nWould to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,\nthat might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment\nyou with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.\nThis unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the\npleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\n\"Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.\"\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with\nonly one serious parting look, went away.",

            "text": "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness. Never since reading Jane's second letter had she entertained a\nhope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\nof all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,\nthat Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry\nfor money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one\nofficer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\nfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now\nfeel it!\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never\nbeen a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\npromised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\nby one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be\ndone about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?\"\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n_That_ is all settled.\"\n\"What is all settled?\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\nprepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\ntruth? Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\nBut wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\nbe written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\nGardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",

It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form\nsuch a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel's family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\nnot adequate to the risk.\"\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle's\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe\nhim capable of it?\"\n\"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\nI can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\nhope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?\"\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n\"Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\nBarnet road.\"\n\"Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.\"\n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\nmarriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular\nfriend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\nrestraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\ndo as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter.\"",

Why did the Forsters ever let her go out\nof their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their\nside, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had\nbeen well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have\nthe charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear\nchild! And now here's Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight\nWickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is\nto become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold\nin his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what\nwe shall do.\"\nThey all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after\ngeneral assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her\nthat he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.\nBennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.\n\"Do not give way to useless alarm,\" added he: \"though it is right to be\nprepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.\nIt is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we\nmay gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,\nand have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as\nlost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him\ncome home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult\ntogether as to what is to be done.\"\n\"Oh, my dear brother,\" replied Mrs. Bennet, \"that is exactly what I\ncould most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,\nwherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them\nmarry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but\ntell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,\nafter they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from\nfighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened\nout of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,\nsuch spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my\nheart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear\nLydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,\nfor she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how\nkind you are! I know you will contrive it all.\"\nBut Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours\nin the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in\nher hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till\ndinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the\nhousekeeper, who attended in the absence of her daughters.",

After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued\nthe subject by saying, \"But tell me all and everything about it which I\nhave not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\nespecially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\ngrieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\n\"Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am\ninclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.\"\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last letter\nshe had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their\nbeing in love with each other many weeks.\"\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\n\"No, I believe not.\"\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\nknow his real character?\"\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:\nbut I hope this may be false.\"\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\nthis could not have happened!\"\n\"Perhaps it would have been better,\" replied her sister.\n\"But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what\ntheir present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.\"\n\"We acted with the best intentions.\"",

It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another might be\nremarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\ndetermined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\nto find out the stand and number of the coach.

Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and\nmyself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable\nfamily, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\nkind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\narguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\na misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\nmust be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent's mind. The\ndeath of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of\nthis. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\nsuppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\nof behaviour in your\n[Illustration:\n\"To whom I have related the affair\"\n[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\ndaughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence; though,\nat the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,\nI am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally\nbad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an\nage. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to be pitied; in\nwhich opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by\nLady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.\nThey agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one\ndaughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for\nwho, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect\nthemselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,\nmoreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain\nevent of last November; for had it been otherwise, I must have been\ninvolved in all your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you, then,\nmy dear sir, to console yourself as much as possible, to throw off\nyour unworthy child from your affection for ever, and leave her to\nreap the fruits of her own heinous offence.\n\"I am, dear sir,\" etc., etc.",

He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to\nbe her husband might then have rested in its proper place.\nHe was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone\nshould be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he\nwas determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,\nand to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her\nhusband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\nincome.\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\nlatter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her\nthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expenses had been very little within\nthat sum.",

The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive\nthem. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to\nthe door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,\nanxious, uneasy.\nLydia's voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and\nshe ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and\nwelcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to\nWickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an\nalacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.\nTheir reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite\nso cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely\nopened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was\nenough to provoke him.\nElizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was\nLydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned\nfrom sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at\nlength they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of\nsome little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a\ngreat while since she had been there.\nWickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners\nwere always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been\nexactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he\nclaimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth\nhad not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat\ndown, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the\nimpudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the\ncheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of\ncolour.",

You were\nnot by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you\ncurious to hear how it was managed?\"\n\"No, really,\" replied Elizabeth; \"I think there cannot be too little\nsaid on the subject.\"\n\"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\no'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\nwere to meet us at the church.\n\"Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,\nyou know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should\nhave gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was\ndressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a\nsermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was\nthinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether\nhe would be married in his blue coat.\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was\nrather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.\n\"Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was\ncalled away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you\nknow, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so\nfrightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;\nand if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,\nluckily, he came back again in ten minutes' time, and then we all set\nout. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented\ngoing, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as\nwell.\"\n\"Mr. Darcy!\" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.\n\"Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!\nI quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised\nthem so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!\"\n\"If it was to be a secret,\" said Jane, \"say not another word on the\nsubject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.\"\n\"Oh, certainly,\" said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; \"we will\nask you no questions.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Lydia; \"for if you did, I should certainly tell you\nall, and then Wickham would be so angry.\"\nOn such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her\npower, by running away.\nBut to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it\nwas impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her\nsister's wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,\nwhere he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.\nConjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her\nbrain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as\nplacing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She\ncould not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,\nwrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what\nLydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been\nintended.\n\"You may readily comprehend,\" she added, \"what my curiosity must be to\nknow how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively\nspeaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such\na time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,\nfor very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to\nthink necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with\nignorance.\"",

I must confess myself\nsurprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\nDon't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\nthat I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_\nside. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\nimpertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing\nbut the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed\nhim to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\nignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\nhome from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\nDarcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\nover before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\nas _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he\nhad found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he\nhad seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.\nFrom what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after\nourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for\nthem. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to\nhimself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well known as\nto make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or\nconfide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken\npride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to\nlay his private actions open to the world. His character was to\nspeak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\nforward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on\nby himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\ndisgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to\ndiscover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\nmore than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another\nreason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\ndismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\nhe did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,\nand has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\nYounge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\nwent to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\nit was two or three days before he could get from her what he\nwanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\nand corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\nfound. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in\nLondon; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\nwould have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\nStreet. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\nHis first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\nher to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\nfriends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\noffering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\nabsolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\nof her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of\nleaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\nother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\nfeelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\nmarriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\neasily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\nobliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour\nwhich were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill\nconsequences of Lydia's flight on her own folly alone. He meant to\nresign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,\nhe could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but\nhe did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live\non. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.\nThough Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have\nbeen able to do something for him, and his situation must have been\nbenefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,\nthat Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making\nhis fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such\ncircumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the\ntemptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there\nwas much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he\ncould get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything\nbeing settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was to make\nyour uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch\nStreet the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not\nbe seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father\nwas still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did\nnot judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly\nconsult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him\ntill after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,\nand till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called\non business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your\nuncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk\ntogether. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It\nwas not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express\nwas sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I\nfancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,\nafter all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;\nbut _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not\ndo himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,\ntherefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have\nsettled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which\nwas more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it\ndeserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead\nof being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up\nwith only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely\nagainst the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning\ngave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that\nwould rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where\nit was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or\nJane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done\nfor the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I\nbelieve, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another\nthousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\ncommission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\nalone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\nreserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character\nhad been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\nreceived and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_\nreserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\nfine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that\nyour uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\nfor _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\non, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\nPemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\nwhen the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\nreceive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.\nIt is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\nhope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\nus, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\nexactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\nwould not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\nwhile she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter\nlast Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\npiece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no\nfresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\nrepresenting to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all\nthe unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it\nwas by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes\nquite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,\nand for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual\nin his return, and, as Lydia informed you, attended the wedding. He\ndined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on\nWednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\nLizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\nenough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,\nin every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\nHis understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\na little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\nwife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever\nmentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\nme, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\nfar as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\nhave been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair\nof ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The\nchildren have been wanting me this half hour.\n\"Yours, very sincerely,\n\"M. GARDINER.\"",

She looked at Jane, and\nsmiled, and shook her head, by turns.\n\"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,\" (for Mrs.\nPhilips first brought her the news). \"Well, so much the better. Not that\nI care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I\nnever want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to\nNetherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that\nis nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention\na word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?\"\n\"You may depend on it,\" replied the other, \"for Mrs. Nichols was in\nMeryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose\nto know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He\ncomes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was\ngoing to the butcher's, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on\nWednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.\"",

People _did_ say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers. It was in the 'Times' and the 'Courier,' I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\nGeorge Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.\nIt was my brother Gardiner's drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came\nto make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\ncontinued her mother; \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a\nplace quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not\nknow how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of\nhis leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.\nThank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he\ndeserves.\"\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,\nthe exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done\nbefore; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the\ncountry at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\n\"I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.\nBennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the coveys for you.\"\nElizabeth's misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for\nmoments of such painful confusion.\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to be\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\none or the other again!\"",

            "text": "On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\nthe place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\ndecided. He placed himself by her.\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\nbore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.\nHis behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\nand she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family.\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,\nthan the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen\ncame, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.\nShe looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her\nchance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\n\"If he does not come to me, _then_,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for\never.\"\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--\n\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\ndo we?\"\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\nher eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough\nto help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for\nbeing so silly!\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.\"\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\n\"Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.\"\n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough\nthese three weeks.\"\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.\nWhen the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.",

The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucases' last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\nwhat do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\nat Netherfield at last!' She did, indeed.

I hope we\nmay often meet again.\"\nElizabeth smiled.\n\"Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies me. I\nassure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an\nagreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it. I am\nperfectly satisfied, from what his manners now are, that he never had\nany design of engaging my affection. It is only that he is blessed with\ngreater sweetness of address, and a stronger desire of generally\npleasing, than any other man.\"\n\"You are very cruel,\" said her sister, \"you will not let me smile, and\nare provoking me to it every moment.\"\n\"How hard it is in some cases to be believed! And how impossible in\nothers! But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I\nacknowledge?\"\n\"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all love to\ninstruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing. Forgive\nme; and if you persist in indifference, do not make _me_ your\nconfidante.\"\n[Illustration:",

He sat with them above an hour, and was in remarkably\ngood spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him to dine with them; but, with many\nexpressions of concern, he confessed himself engaged elsewhere.\n\"Next time you call,\" said she, \"I hope we shall be more lucky.\"\nHe should be particularly happy at any time, etc., etc.; and if she\nwould give him leave, would take an early opportunity of waiting on\nthem.\n\"Can you come to-morrow?\"\nYes, he had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her invitation was\naccepted with alacrity.\nHe came, and in such very good time, that the ladies were none of them\ndressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughters' room, in her\ndressing-gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out,--\n\"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He is come--Mr. Bingley is\ncome. He is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come to Miss\nBennet this moment, and help her on with her gown. Never mind Miss\nLizzy's hair.\"\n\"We will be down as soon as we can,\" said Jane; \"but I dare say Kitty is\nforwarder than either of us, for she went upstairs half an hour ago.\"\n\"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she to do with it? Come, be quick, be quick!\nwhere is your sash, my dear?\"\nBut when her mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to go down\nwithout one of her sisters.\nThe same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the\nevening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his\ncustom, and Mary went upstairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the\nfive being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at\nElizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any\nimpression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last\nKitty did, she very innocently said, \"What is the matter, mamma? What do\nyou keep winking at me for? What am I to do?\"\n\"Nothing, child, nothing. I did not wink at you.\" She then sat still\nfive minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she\nsuddenly got up, and saying to Kitty,--\n\"Come here, my love, I want to speak to you,\" took her out of the room.\nJane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such\npremeditation, and her entreaty that _she_ would not give in to it. In a\nfew minutes, Mrs. Bennet half opened the door and called out,--\n\"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you.\"\nElizabeth was forced to go.\n\"We may as well leave them by themselves, you know,\" said her mother as\nsoon as she was in the hall. \"Kitty and I are going upstairs to sit in\nmy dressing-room.\"\nElizabeth made no attempt to reason with her mother, but remained\nquietly in the hall till she and Kitty were out of sight, then returned\ninto the drawing-room.\nMrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was\neverything that was charming, except the professed lover of her\ndaughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable\naddition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged\nofficiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a\nforbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the\ndaughter.\nHe scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away\nan engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet's\nmeans, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.\nAfter this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed",

She will be down in a moment, I dare say.\"\nHe then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes\nand affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\ngreat cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen\nto all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\nexpectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for\nbasis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\nhimself.\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet's mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed\nhow really happy he was.\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,--\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\ngoodness.\n\"You are a good girl,\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.\"\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be\nunpardonable in _me_.\"\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely\nmore.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so\nhappy! I am sure I shan't get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\nthat you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that\never was seen!\"\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\nfavourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\nhimself obliged to accept.\nElizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for\nwhile he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but\nshe found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of\nseparation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always\nattached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and\nwhen Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.\n\"He has made me so happy,\" said she, one evening, \"by telling me that he\nwas totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed\nit possible.\"\n\"I suspected as much,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But how did he account for\nit?\"\n\"It must have been his sisters' doing. They were certainly no friends to\nhis acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have\nchosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,\nas I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will\nlearn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we\ncan never be what we once were to each other.\"\n\"That is the most unforgiving speech,\" said Elizabeth, \"that I ever\nheard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again\nthe dupe of Miss Bingley's pretended regard.\"\n\"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he\nreally loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent\nwould have prevented his coming down again?\"\n\"He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his\nmodesty.\"\nThis naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and\nthe little value he put on his own good qualities.\nElizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference\nof his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving\nheart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice\nher against him.\n\"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!\" cried\nJane. \"Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed\nabove them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such\nanother man for you!\"\n\"If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.\nTill I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your\nhappiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very\ngood luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.\"\nThe situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a\nsecret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and\nshe ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her\nneighbours in Meryton.\nThe Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the\nworld; though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first run away,\nthey had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune.\n[Illustration]",

Elizabeth had mentioned her\nname to her mother on her Ladyship's entrance, though no request of\nintroduction had been made.\nMrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such\nhigh importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting\nfor a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--\n\"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your\nmother?\"\nElizabeth replied very concisely that she was.\n\"And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?\"\n\"Yes, madam,\" said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.\n\"She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,\nwho, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.\"\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine, after a\nshort silence.\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I\nassure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.\"\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in\nsummer: the windows are full west.\"\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\nadded,--\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and\nMrs. Collins well?\"\n\"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.\"\nElizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from\nCharlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no\nletter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.\nMrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some\nrefreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,\ndeclined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--\n\"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness\non one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.\"\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and show her Ladyship about the\ndifferent walks.

Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I\ncome.\"\nElizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.\n\"Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account\nfor the honour of seeing you here.\"\n\"Miss Bennet,\" replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, \"you ought to\nknow that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may\nchoose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been\ncelebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such\nmoment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most\nalarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your\nsister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that\n_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon\nafterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I\n_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him\nso much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on\nsetting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to\nyou.\"\n\"If you believed it impossible to be true,\" said Elizabeth, colouring\nwith astonishment and disdain, \"I wonder you took the trouble of coming\nso far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?\"\n\"At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.\"\n\"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,\" said Elizabeth\ncoolly, \"will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report\nis in existence.\"\n\"If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been\nindustriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a\nreport is spread abroad?\"\n\"I never heard that it was.\"\n\"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?\"\n\"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_\nmay ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.\"\n\"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has\nhe, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?\"\n\"Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.\"\n\"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his\nreason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,\nhave made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You\nmay have drawn him in.\"\n\"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.\"\n\"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such\nlanguage as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,\nand am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.\"\n\"But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as\nthis ever induce me to be explicit.\"\n\"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the\npresumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is\nengaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?\"\n\"Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will\nmake an offer to me.\"\nLady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--\n\"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,\nthey have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of\n_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the\nunion; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be\naccomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of\ninferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to\nthe family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his\ntacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of\npropriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his\nearliest hours he was destined for his cousin?\"\n\"Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no\nother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\nkept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\nMiss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"\n\"Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss\nBennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or\nfriends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will\nbe censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.\nYour alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned\nby any of us.\"\n\"These are heavy misfortunes,\" replied Elizabeth. \"But the wife of Mr.\nDarcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily\nattached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause\nto repine.\"\n\"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude\nfor my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that\nscore? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came\nhere with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I\nbe dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person's\nwhims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.\"\n\"_That_ will make your Ladyship's situation at present more pitiable;\nbut it will have no effect on _me_.\"\n\"I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my\nnephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal\nside, from the same noble line; and, on the father's, from respectable,\nhonourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on\nboth sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of\nevery member of their respective houses; and what is to divide\nthem?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,\nconnections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall\nnot be! If you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to\nquit the sphere in which you have been brought up.\"\n\"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as quitting that\nsphere. He is a gentleman; I am a gentleman's daughter; so far we are\nequal.\"\n\"True. You _are_ a gentleman's daughter. But what was your mother? Who\nare your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of their\ncondition.\"\n\"Whatever my connections may be,\" said Elizabeth, \"if your nephew does\nnot object to them, they can be nothing to _you_.\"\n\"Tell me, once for all, are you engaged to him?\"\nThough Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady\nCatherine, have answered this question, she could not but say, after a\nmoment's deliberation,--\n\"I am not.\"\nLady Catherine seemed pleased.\n\"And will you promise me never to enter into such an engagement?\"\n\"I will make no promise of the kind.\"\n\"Miss Bennet, I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a more\nreasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a belief that I\nwill ever recede. I shall not go away till you have given me the\nassurance I require.\"\n\"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into\nanything so wholly unreasonable. Your Ladyship wants Mr. Darcy to marry\nyour daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make\n_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to\nme, would _my_ refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on\nhis cousin? Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with\nwhich you have supported this extraordinary application have been as\nfrivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my\ncharacter, if you think I can be worked on by such persuasions as these.\nHow far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,\nI cannot tell; but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in\nmine. I must beg, therefore, to be importuned no further on the",

Lady Catherine, it\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\nLucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had\nonly set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had\nlooked forward to as possible at some future time.\nIn revolving Lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an\napplication to her nephew; and how he might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity\nunblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady\nCatherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to\nBingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.\n\"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his\nfriend within a few days,\" she added, \"I shall know how to understand\nit. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his\nconstancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might\nhave obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him\nat all.\"",

It suddenly struck her that it might\nbe from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the\nconsequent explanations.\nShe followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He\nthen said,--\n\"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me\nexceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its\ncontents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink\nof matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.\"\nThe colour now rushed into Elizabeth's cheeks in the instantaneous\nconviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;\nand she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained\nhimself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to\nherself, when her father continued,--\n\"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters\nas these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the\nname of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.\"\n\"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?\"\n\"Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says\non that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--'Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\nher eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate\nmay be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages\nin this land.' Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\n'This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the\nheart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and\nextensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn\nmy cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a\nprecipitate closure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course,\nyou will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.' Have you any idea,\nLizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. 'My motive for\ncautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,\nLady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly\neye.' _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\nhis life! It is admirable!\"\nElizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\nlittle agreeable to her.\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\n\"Oh, yes. Pray read on.\"\n\"'After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of\nsome family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give\nher consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my\nduty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she\nand her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.' Mr.\nCollins, moreover, adds, 'I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\nliving together before the marriage took place should be so generally\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\na Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their\nnames to be mentioned in your hearing.' _That_ is his notion of\nChristian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear\nCharlotte's situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,\nLizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be\n_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For\nwhat do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them\nin our turn?\"\n\"Oh,\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so\nstrange!\"\n\"Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_\npointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\nrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference; and she could do nothing but",

The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to\ntell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in\nmomentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed\ntheir all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the\nhabit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five\nset off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to\noutstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy\nwere to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was\ntoo much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a\ndesperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.\nThey walked towards the Lucases', because Kitty wished to call upon\nMaria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,\nwhen Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone.

I\ncan no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor\nsister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to\nacknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest\nof my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.\"\n\"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,\" replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise\nand emotion, \"that you have ever been informed of what may, in a\nmistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner\nwas so little to be trusted.\"\n\"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia's thoughtlessness first betrayed to\nme that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could\nnot rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,\nin the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced\nyou to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the\nsake of discovering them.\"\n\"If you _will_ thank me,\" he replied, \"let it be for yourself alone.\nThat the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other\ninducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your\n_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought\nonly of _you_.\"\nElizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,\nher companion added, \"You are too generous to trifle with me. If your\nfeelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_\naffections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence\nme on this subject for ever.\"\nElizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of\nhis situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not\nvery fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone\nso material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make\nher receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The\nhappiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never\nfelt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as\nwarmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth\nbeen able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the\nexpression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but\nthough she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings\nwhich, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection\nevery moment more valuable.\nThey walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to\nbe thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She\nsoon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding\nto the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through\nLondon, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the\nsubstance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on\nevery expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship's apprehension,\npeculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that\nsuch a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from\nher nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her\nLadyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.\n\"It taught me to hope,\" said he, \"as I had scarcely ever allowed myself\nto hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that\nhad you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have\nacknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.\"\nElizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, \"Yes, you know enough of\nmy _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so\nabominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all\nyour relations.\"\n\"What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your\naccusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour\nto you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was\nunpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.\"\n\"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that\nevening,\" said Elizabeth. \"The conduct of neither, if strictly\nexamined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,\nimproved in civility.\"\n\"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'Had you behaved in a\nmore gentlemanlike manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you can\nscarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I\nconfess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\na way.\"\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway that would induce you to accept me.\"\n\"Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at\nall. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.\"\nDarcy mentioned his letter. \"Did it,\" said he,--\"did it _soon_ make you\nthink better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\ncontents?\"\nShe explained what its effects on her had been, and how gradually all\nher former prejudices had been removed.\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part,\nespecially the opening of it, which I should dread your having the power\nof reading again. I can remember some expressions which might justly\nmake you hate me.\"\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\nchanged as that implies.\"\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly\ncalm and cool; but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\nof the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely\ndifferent from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance\nattending it ought to be forgotten. You must learn some of my\nphilosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\npleasure.\"\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\narising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of\nignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\nintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\nchild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\ntemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\nand conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),\nI was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\nmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might\nstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\nowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\nadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\ndoubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\nwishing, expecting my addresses.\"\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure\nyou. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me\nwrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!\"\n\"Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to\ntake a proper direction.\"\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\n\"No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.\"\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\"\n\"My object _then_,\" replied Darcy, \"was to show you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half\nan hour after I had seen you.\"\nHe then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there\nhad arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\ncomprehend.\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\neach to be dwelt on farther.",

            "text": "\"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?\" was a question\nwhich Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and\nfrom all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in\nreply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own\nknowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything\nelse, awakened a suspicion of the truth.\nThe evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\nthe family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\nfrom Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\nyou shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.\"\n\"This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;\nand I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I\nam in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we\nare engaged.\"\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\nyou dislike him.\"\n\"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\ndid not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\nremember it myself.\"\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\nseriously, assured her of its truth.\n\"Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,\" cried\nJane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you\ncertain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\nhappy with him?\"\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we\nare to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?\nShall you like to have such a brother?\"\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\nto do?\"\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I\ntell you all.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\nafraid you will be angry.\"\n\"My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.\nLet me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me\nhow long you have loved him?\"\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;\nbut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\nat Pemberley.\"\nAnother entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\nfurther to wish.\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself. I\nalways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\nof it to another, not to you.\"\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer\nconceal from her his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,\nand half the night spent in conversation.",

What shall we do with him?\nLizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley's\nway.\"\nElizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet\nwas really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an\nepithet.\nAs soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and\nshook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;\nand he soon afterwards said aloud, \"Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes\nhereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?\"\n\"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,\" said Mrs. Bennet, \"to walk\nto Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has\nnever seen the view.\"\n\"It may do very well for the others,\" replied Mr. Bingley; \"but I am\nsure it will be too much for Kitty. Won't it, Kitty?\"\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\ncuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\nconsented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\nsaying,--\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\ndisagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is\nall for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\nhim except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.\"\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be\nasked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the\napplication for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\ndisapprobation.",

She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, \"Go to your father; he\nwants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,\nof her attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n\"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\nBut will they make you happy?\"\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my\nindifference?\"\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes; \"I love him.\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.\"\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\nabout.\"\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\nand, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\nmonths' suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,\nshe did conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the\nmatch.\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\nyou, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.\"\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\nand economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading\nMr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"",

She began at length to recover, to fidget about in\nher chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\nhave thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\nyou will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my\ndear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\nLord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.\"\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else. Ten\nthousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a lord! And a\nspecial licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.\nBut, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond\nof, that I may have it to-morrow.\"\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.",

At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\nmeeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\nMrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's\ngood-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be\nvulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at\nall likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to\nshield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to\nkeep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might\nconverse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings\narising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its\npleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward\nwith delight to the time when they should be removed from society so\nlittle pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their\nfamily party at Pemberley.",

He bore with philosophy the conviction that\nElizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude\nand falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of\neverything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be\nprevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which\nElizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by\nhis wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The\nletter was to this effect:--\n/* \"My dear Lizzy, */\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear\nWickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\nso rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\nthink of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\nmuch; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\nupon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four\nhundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\nif you had rather not.\n\"Yours,\" etc.\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in\nher answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\nof what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\nherself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards\ndischarging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a\ncheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection\nfor her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,\nin spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\nreputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never\nreceive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth's sake, he assisted him",
