If\nyou lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.\n3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State\nwill not be equal to the strain.\n4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength\nexhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to\ntake advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be\nable to avert the consequences that must ensue.\n5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has\nnever been seen associated with long delays.\n[This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of\nthe commentators. Ts'ao Kung, Li Ch'uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and\nMei Yao-ch'en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally\nstupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho\nShih says: \"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure\nof energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but\nthey bring calamity in their train.\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by\nremarking: \"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being\nexpended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true\ncleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities.\" Chang Yu\nsays: \"So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable\nto clever dilatoriness.\" Now Sun Tz\u016d says nothing whatever, except\npossibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than\ningenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much\nmore guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious,\ntardiness can never be anything but foolish\u2014if only because it means\nimpoverishment to the nation. In considering the point raised here by\nSun Tz\u016d, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur\nto the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome\nagainst that of Hannibals's isolated army, because it seemed to him\nthat the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a\nstrange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics\nwould have proved successful in the long run. Their reversal it is\ntrue, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption\nin their favour.]",

But the commentators\nunderstand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T'ai Kung: \"A\nkingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be\ndirected from within.\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement,\nor when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the\nthick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he\nwill be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong\norders.]\n14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he\nadministers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in\nan army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.\n[Ts'ao Kung's note is, freely translated: \"The military sphere and the\ncivil sphere are wholly distinct; you can't handle an army in kid\ngloves.\" And Chang Yu says: \"Humanity and justice are the principles on\nwhich to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility,\non the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate\nthe governing of an army\"\u2014to that of a State, understood.]\n15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,\n[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to\ncircumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\n[I follow Mei Yao-ch'en here. The other commentators refer not to the\nruler, as in \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu\nsays: \"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he\nmust not be entrusted with a position of authority.\" Tu Mu quotes: \"The\nskilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the\ncovetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in\nestablishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in\naction, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid\nman has no fear of death.\"]\n16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trouble is sure to\ncome from the other feudal princes. This is simply bringing anarchy\ninto the army, and flinging victory away.",

The secret\nlies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip.\nThus Wu Tz\u016d says: 'With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an\ninferior one, make for difficult ground.'\"]\n(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout\nall its ranks.\n(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy\nunprepared.\n(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by\nthe sovereign.\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz\u016d as saying: \"It is the sovereign's function to\ngive broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of\nthe general.\" It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which\nhave been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on\nthe part of the home government.

To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the\nopportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.\n[That is, of course, by a mistake on the enemy's part.]\n3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself against defeat,\n[Chang Yu says this is done, \"By concealing the disposition of his\ntroops, covering up his tracks, and taking unremitting precautions.\"]\nbut cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.\n4. Hence the saying: One may _know_ how to conquer without being able\nto _do_ it.\n5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics; ability to defeat\nthe enemy means taking the offensive.\n[I retain the sense found in a similar passage in \u00a7\u00a7 1-3, in spite of\nthe fact that the commentators are all against me. The meaning they\ngive, \"He who cannot conquer takes the defensive,\" is plausible\nenough.]\n6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient strength;\nattacking, a superabundance of strength.\n7. The general who is skilled in defence hides in the most secret\nrecesses of the earth;\n[Literally, \"hides under the ninth earth,\" which is a metaphor\nindicating the utmost secrecy and concealment, so that the enemy may\nnot know his whereabouts.\"]\nhe who is skilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of\nheaven.\n[Another metaphor, implying that he falls on his adversary like a\nthunderbolt, against which there is no time to prepare. This is the\nopinion of most of the commentators.]\nThus on the one hand we have ability to protect ourselves; on the\nother, a victory that is complete.\n8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is\nnot the acme of excellence.\n[As Ts'ao Kung remarks, \"the thing is to see the plant before it has\ngerminated,\" to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li\nCh'uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the\nvastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city\nof Ch'eng-an, said to his officers: \"Gentlemen, we are going to\nannihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner.\" The officers\nhardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But\nHan Hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever\nstratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and\ninflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.\"]",

Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only seeks battle\nafter the victory has been won, whereas he who is destined to defeat\nfirst fights and afterwards looks for victory.\n[Ho Shih thus expounds the paradox: \"In warfare, first lay plans which\nwill ensure victory, and then lead your army to battle; if you will not\nbegin with stratagem but rely on brute strength alone, victory will no\nlonger be assured.\"]\n16. The consummate leader cultivates the moral law, and strictly\nadheres to method and discipline; thus it is in his power to control\nsuccess.\n17. In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;\nsecondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,\nBalancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\n18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to\nMeasurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of\nchances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.\n[It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the\nChinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,\nwhich enable us to form an estimate of the enemy's strength, and to\nmake calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a\ngeneral weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy's chances with our own;\nif the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty\nlies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a\ncalculation of _numbers_, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the\nsecond term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a\nconsideration of the enemy's general position or condition, while the\nthird term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other\nhand, Tu Mu says: \"The question of relative strength having been\nsettled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play.\" Ho\nShih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it. However, it points to\nthe third term as being a calculation of numbers.]\n19. A victorious army opposed to a routed one, is as a pound's weight\nplaced in the scale against a single grain.\n[Literally, \"a victorious army is like an _i_ (20 oz.) weighed against\na _shu_ (1/24 oz.); a routed army is a _shu_ weighed against an _i_.\"\nThe point is simply the enormous advantage which a disciplined force,\nflushed with victory, has over one demoralized by defeat. Legge, in his\nnote on Mencius, I. 2. ix. 2, makes the _i_ to be 24 Chinese ounces,\nand corrects Chu Hsi's statement that it equaled 20 oz. only. But Li\nCh'uan of the T'ang dynasty here gives the same figure as Chu Hsi.]\n20. The onrush of a conquering force is like the bursting of pent-up\nwaters into a chasm a thousand fathoms deep.

[Ch'ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told,\nthe march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise man\u0153uver was\n_ch'i_.\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:\n\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch'i_ and\n_cheng_. Wei Liao Tz\u016d [4th cent. B.C.] says: 'Direct warfare favours\nfrontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.'

A.D.] says: 'In war, to march straight ahead is\n_cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch'i_.' These\nwriters simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch'i_ as _ch'i_; they do\nnot note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each\nother like the two sides of a circle [see infra, \u00a7 11]. A comment on\nthe T'ang Emperor T'ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: 'A _ch'i_\nman\u0153uver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_;\nthen our real attack will be _ch'i_, and vice versa. The whole secret\nlies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real\nintent.'\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other\noperation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;\nwhereas that is _ch'i_,\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an\nunexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to\nbe _ch'i_,\" it immediately becomes _cheng_.\"]",

[1] ]\n3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach\nof his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible\nfor the enemy to draw near.\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he\nwill strike at some important point which the enemy will have to\ndefend.]\n4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch'en's\ninterpretation of I. \u00a7 23.]\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped,\nhe can force him to move.\n5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march\nswiftly to places where you are not expected.\n6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches\nthrough country where the enemy is not.\n[Ts'ao Kung sums up very well: \"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \"a bolt\nfrom the blue\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are\ndefended, attack in unexpected quarters.\"]\n7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack\nplaces which are undefended.\n[Wang Hsi explains \"undefended places\" as \"weak points; that is to say,\nwhere the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit;\nwhere the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict\nenough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or\nthe defenders are variance amongst themselves.\"]\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions\nthat cannot be attacked.\n[_I.e._, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There\nis rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later\nclause. Tu Mu, Ch'en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch'en assume the meaning to be:\n\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend _even_ those\nplaces that are not likely to be attacked;\" and Tu Mu adds: \"How much\nmore, then, those that will be attacked.\" Taken thus, however, the\nclause balances less well with the preceding\u2014always a consideration in\nthe highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang\nYu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \"He who is\nskilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see\nIV. \u00a7 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This\nbeing so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the\nenemy cannot defend\u2026. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most\nsecret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to\nestimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold\nare precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\"]\n8. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not\nknow what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does\nnot know what to attack.",

We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up\ninto fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate\nparts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.\n15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior\none, our opponents will be in dire straits.\n16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then\nthe enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several\ndifferent points;\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant's victories by\nsaying that \"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering\nwhat he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to\ndo himself.\"]\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers\nwe shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\n17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;\nshould he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he\nstrengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his\nright, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,\nhe will everywhere be weak.\n[In Frederick the Great's _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: \"A\ndefensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those\ngenerals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every\npoint, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,\nhaving only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,\nand acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater.\"]\n18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible\nattacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make\nthese preparations against us.\n[The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson's words, is \"to compel the\nenemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force\nagainst each fraction in turn.\"]\n19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may\nconcentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\n[What Sun Tz\u016d evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of\ndistances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a\ngeneral to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,\nand afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the\nright hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.\nAmong many such successful junctions which military history records,\none of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher\njust at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]\n20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be\nimpotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the\nleft, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the\nvan. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything\nunder a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by\nseveral _li_!\n[The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,\nbut the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an\narmy advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of\nwhich has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the\nvarious detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise\ninstructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be\nable to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu's note may be worth\nquoting here: \"If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to\nconcentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will\nbe forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we\nhold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall\nbe brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support\nwill be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there\nis any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of\nthe army.\"]",

Man\u0153uvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined\nmultitude, most dangerous.\n[I adopt the reading of the _T'ung Tien_, Cheng Yu-hsien and the _T'u\nShu_, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to\nmake sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to\nmean that man\u0153uvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all\ndepends on the ability of the general.]\n6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an\nadvantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other\nhand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice\nof its baggage and stores.\n[Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese\ncommentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering\nwithout much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated\ncorruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tz\u016d does not\napprove of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf.\ninfra, \u00a7 11.]\n7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make\nforced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual\ndistance at a stretch,\n[The ordinary day's march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 _li_; but on one\noccasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts'ao Ts'ao is said to have covered\nthe incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.]\ndoing a hundred _li_ in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all\nyour three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,\nand on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its\ndestination.\n[The moral is, as Ts'ao Kung and others point out: Don't march a\nhundred _li_ to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without\nimpedimenta. Man\u0153uvers of this description should be confined to short\ndistances. Stonewall Jackson said: \"The hardships of forced marches are\noften more painful than the dangers of battle.\" He did not often call\nupon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he\nintended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he\nsacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]\n9. If you march fifty _li_ in order to outman\u0153uver the enemy, you will\nlose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will\nreach the goal.\n[Literally, \"the leader of the first division will be _torn away_.\"]\n10. If you march thirty _li_ with the same object, two-thirds of your\narmy will arrive.\n[In the _T'ung Tien_ is added: \"From this we may know the difficulty of\nman\u0153uvering.\"]\n11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;\nwithout provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.\n[I think Sun Tz\u016d meant \"stores accumulated in d\u00e9p\u00f4ts.\" But Tu Yu says",

The style of this fragment is not noticeably different\nfrom that of Sun Tz\u016d himself, but no commentator raises a doubt as to\nits genuineness.]\n23. The Book of Army Management says:\n[It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give\nus any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch'en calls it \"an ancient\nmilitary classic,\" and Wang Hsi, \"an old book on war.\" Considering the\nenormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before Sun\nTz\u016d's time between the various kingdoms and principalities of China, it\nis not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims should\nhave been made and written down at some earlier period.]\nOn the field of battle,\n[Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.]\nthe spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of\ngongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence\nthe institution of banners and flags.\n24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and\neyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point.\n[Chang Yu says: \"If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the\nsame object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be\nlike those of a single man.\"!]\n25. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either\nfor the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.\n[Chuang Yu quotes a saying: \"Equally guilty are those who advance\nagainst orders and those who retreat against orders.\" Tu Mu tells a\nstory in this connection of Wu Ch'i, when he was fighting against the\nCh'in State. Before the battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of\nmatchless daring, sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the\nenemy, and returned to camp. Wu Ch'i had the man instantly executed,\nwhereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: \"This man was a\ngood soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded.\" Wu Ch'i replied: \"I\nfully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because he\nacted without orders.\"]\nThis is the art of handling large masses of men.\n26.

Then they\nfought, and the men of Ch'i were utterly defeated. Questioned\nafterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts'ao Kuei\nreplied: \"In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first\nroll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is\nalready on the wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I\nattacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at its height. Hence\nour victory.\" Wu Tz\u016d (chap. 4) puts \"spirit\" first among the \"four\nimportant influences\" in war, and continues: \"The value of a whole\narmy\u2014a mighty host of a million men\u2014is dependent on one man alone: such\nis the influence of spirit!\"]\na commander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of mind.\n[Chang Yu says: \"Presence of mind is the general's most important\nasset. It is the quality which enables him to discipline disorder and\nto inspire courage into the panic-stricken.\" The great general Li Ching",

The wells they bored ran dry,\nand the men were reduced to squeezing lumps of mud and sucking out the\nmoisture. Their ranks thinned rapidly, until at last Fu Yen-ch'ing\nexclaimed: \"We are desperate men. Far better to die for our country\nthan to go with fettered hands into captivity!\" A strong gale happened\nto be blowing from the northeast and darkening the air with dense\nclouds of sandy dust. To Chung-wei was for waiting until this had\nabated before deciding on a final attack; but luckily another officer,\nLi Shou-cheng by name, was quicker to see an opportunity, and said:\n\"They are many and we are few, but in the midst of this sandstorm our\nnumbers will not be discernible; victory will go to the strenuous\nfighter, and the wind will be our best ally.\" Accordingly, Fu\nYen-ch'ing made a sudden and wholly unexpected onslaught with his\ncavalry, routed the barbarians and succeeded in breaking through to\nsafety.]\n37.

These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The\nCommander; (5) Method and discipline.\n[It appears from what follows that Sun Tz\u016d means by \"Moral Law\" a\nprinciple of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tz\u016d in its moral\naspect. One might be tempted to render it by \"morale,\" were it not\nconsidered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in \u00a7 13.]\n5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with\ntheir ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,\nundismayed by any danger.\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz\u016d as saying: \"Without constant practice, the\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\"]\n7. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.\n[The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words\nhere. Meng Shih refers to \"the hard and the soft, waxing and waning\" of\nHeaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is\n\"the general economy of Heaven,\" including the five elements, the four\nseasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]\n8. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;\nopen ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.\n9. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,\nbenevolence, courage and strictness.\n[The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or\nbenevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control,\nor \"proper feeling;\" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here\n\"wisdom\" and \"sincerity\" are put before \"humanity or benevolence,\" and\nthe two military virtues of \"courage\" and \"strictness\" substituted for\n\"uprightness of mind\" and \"self-respect, self-control, or 'proper\nfeeling.'\"]\n10. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of\nthe army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the\nofficers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the\narmy, and the control of military expenditure.\n11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows\nthem will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.\n12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the\nmilitary conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in\nthis wise:\u2014",

      "text": "the control of a few men: it is merely a question of dividing up their\nnumbers.\n[That is, cutting up the army into regiments, companies, etc., with\nsubordinate officers in command of each. Tu Mu reminds us of Han Hsin's\nfamous reply to the first Han Emperor, who once said to him: \"How large\nan army do you think I could lead?\" \"Not more than 100,000 men, your\nMajesty.\" \"And you?\" asked the Emperor. \"Oh!\" he answered, \"the more\nthe better.\"]\n2. Fighting with a large army under your command is nowise different\nfrom fighting with a small one: it is merely a question of instituting\nsigns and signals.\n3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the brunt of the\nenemy's attack and remain unshaken\u2014this is effected by man\u0153uvers direct\nand indirect.\n[We now come to one of the most interesting parts of Sun Tz\u016d's\ntreatise, the discussion of the _cheng_ and the _ch'i_.\" As it is by no\nmeans easy to grasp the full significance of these two terms, or to\nrender them consistently by good English equivalents; it may be as well\nto tabulate some of the commentators' remarks on the subject before\nproceeding further. Li Ch'uan: \"Facing the enemy is _cheng_, making\nlateral diversion is _ch'i_. Chia Lin: \"In presence of the enemy, your\ntroops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure\nvictory abnormal man\u0153uvers must be employed.\" Mei Yao-ch'en: \"_Ch'i_ is\nactive, _cheng_ is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity,\nactivity brings the victory itself.\" Ho Shih: \"We must cause the enemy\nto regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed,\nand vice versa; thus _cheng_ may also be _ch'i_, and _ch'i_ may also be\n_cheng_.\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when\nmarching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly\nthrew a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly\ndisconcerting his opponent. [Ch'ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told,\nthe march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise man\u0153uver was\n_ch'i_.\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:\n\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch'i_ and\n_cheng_. Wei Liao Tz\u016d [4th cent. B.C.] says: 'Direct warfare favours\nfrontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.' Ts'ao Kung\nsays: 'Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation;\nappearing on the enemy's rear is an indirect man\u0153uver.' Li Wei-kung\n[6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: 'In war, to march straight ahead is\n_cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch'i_.' These\nwriters simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch'i_ as _ch'i_; they do\nnot note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each\nother like the two sides of a circle [see infra, \u00a7 11]. A comment on\nthe T'ang Emperor T'ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: 'A _ch'i_\nman\u0153uver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_;\nthen our real attack will be _ch'i_, and vice versa. The whole secret\nlies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real\nintent.'\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other\noperation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;\nwhereas that is _ch'i_,\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an\nunexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to\nbe _ch'i_,\" it immediately becomes _cheng_.\"]\n4. That the impact of your army may be like a grindstone dashed against\nan egg\u2014this is effected by the science of weak points and strong.\n5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,\nbut indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.\n[Chang Yu says: \"Steadily develop indirect tactics, either by pounding\nthe enemy's flanks or falling on his rear.\" A brilliant example of\n\"indirect tactics\" which decided the fortunes of a campaign was Lord\nRoberts' night march round the Peiwar Kotal in the second Afghan war.\n[1]\n6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhausible as Heaven\nand Earth, unending as the flow of rivers and streams; like the sun and\nmoon, they end but to begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away\nbut to return once more.\n[Tu Yu and Chang Yu understand this of the permutations of _ch'i_ and\n_cheng_. But at present Sun Tz\u016d is not speaking of _cheng_ at all,\nunless, indeed, we suppose with Cheng Yu-hsien that a clause relating\nto it has fallen out of the text. Of course, as has already been\npointed out, the two are so inextricably interwoven in all military\noperations, that they cannot really be considered apart. Here we simply\nhave an expression, in figurative language, of the almost infinite\nresource of a great leader.]\n7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the combinations of\nthese five give rise to more melodies than can ever be heard.\n8. There are not more than five primary colours (blue, yellow, red,\nwhite, and black), yet in combination they produce more hues than can\never be seen.\n9 There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour, acrid, salt,\nsweet, bitter), yet combinations of them yield more flavours than can\never be tasted.\n10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of attack\u2014the direct\nand the indirect; yet these two in combination give rise to an endless\nseries of man\u0153uvers.\n11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in turn. It is\nlike moving in a circle\u2014you never come to an end. Who can exhaust the\npossibilities of their combination?\n12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent which will even\nroll stones along in its course.\n13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop of a falcon\nwhich enables it to strike and destroy its victim.\n[The Chinese here is tricky and a certain key word in the context it is\nused defies the best efforts of the translator. Tu Mu defines this word\nas \"the measurement or estimation of distance.\" But this meaning does\nnot quite fit the illustrative simile in \u00a7. 15. Applying this\ndefinition to the falcon, it seems to me to denote that instinct of\n_self-restraint_ which keeps the bird from swooping on its quarry until\nthe right moment, together with the power of judging when the right\nmoment has arrived. The analogous quality in soldiers is the highly\nimportant one of being able to reserve their fire until the very\ninstant at which it will be most effective. When the \"Victory\" went\ninto action at Trafalgar at hardly more than drifting pace, she was for\nseveral minutes exposed to a storm of shot and shell before replying\nwith a single gun. Nelson coolly waited until he was within close\nrange, when the broadside he brought to bear worked fearful havoc on\nthe enemy's nearest ships.]\n14. Therefore the good fighter will be terrible in his onset, and\nprompt in his decision.\n[The word \"decision\" would have reference to the measurement of\ndistance mentioned above, letting the enemy get near before striking.\nBut I cannot help thinking that Sun Tz\u016d meant to use the word in a\nfigurative sense comparable to our own idiom \"short and sharp.\" Cf.\nWang Hsi's note, which after describing the falcon's mode of attack,\nproceeds: \"This is just how the 'psychological moment' should be seized\nin war.\"]\n15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a crossbow; decision, to\nthe releasing of the trigger.\n[None of the commentators seem to grasp the real point of the simile of\nenergy and the force stored up in the bent cross-bow until released by\nthe finger on the trigger.]\n16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be seeming\ndisorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid confusion and chaos,\nyour array may be without head or tail, yet it will be proof against\ndefeat.\n[Mei Yao-ch'en says: \"The subdivisions of the army having been\npreviously fixed, and the various signals agreed upon, the separating\nand joining, the dispersing and collecting which will take place in the\ncourse of a battle, may give the appearance of disorder when no real\ndisorder is possible. Your formation may be without head or tail, your\ndispositions all topsy-turvy, and yet a rout of your forces quite out\nof the question.\"]\n17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline; simulated fear\npostulates courage; simulated weakness postulates strength.\n[In order to make the translation intelligible, it is necessary to tone\ndown the sharply paradoxical form of the original. Ts'ao Kung throws\nout a hint of the meaning in his brief note: \"These things all serve to\ndestroy formation and conceal one's condition.\" But Tu Mu is the first\nto put it quite plainly: \"If you wish to feign confusion in order to\nlure the enemy on, you must first have perfect discipline; if you wish\nto display timidity in order to entrap the enemy, you must have extreme\ncourage; if you wish to parade your weakness in order to make the enemy\nover-confident, you must have exceeding strength.\"]\n18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is simply a question of\nsubdivision;\n[See _supra_, \u00a7 1.]\nconcealing courage under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of\nlatent energy;\n[The commentators strongly understand a certain Chinese word here\ndifferently than anywhere else in this chapter. Thus Tu Mu says:\n\"seeing that we are favourably circumstanced and yet make no move, the\nenemy will believe that we are really afraid.\"]\nmasking strength with weakness is to be effected by tactical\ndispositions.\n[Chang Yu relates the following anecdote of Kao Tsu, the first Han\nEmperor: \"Wishing to crush the Hsiung-nu, he sent out spies to report\non their condition. But the Hsiung-nu, forewarned, carefully concealed\nall their able-bodied men and well-fed horses, and only allowed infirm\nsoldiers and emaciated cattle to be seen. The result was that spies one\nand all recommended the Emperor to deliver his attack. Lou Ching alone\nopposed them, saying: 'When two countries go to war, they are naturally\ninclined to make an ostentatious display of their strength. Yet our\nspies have seen nothing but old age and infirmity. This is surely some\n_ruse_ on the part of the enemy, and it would be unwise for us to\nattack.' The Emperor, however, disregarding this advice, fell into the\ntrap and found himself surrounded at Po-teng.\"]\n19. Thus one who is skilful at keeping the enemy on the move maintains\ndeceitful appearances, according to which the enemy will act.\n[Ts'ao Kung's note is \"Make a display of weakness and want.\" Tu Mu\nsays: \"If our force happens to be superior to the enemy's, weakness may\nbe simulated in order to lure him on; but if inferior, he must be led\nto believe that we are strong, in order that he may keep off. In fact,\nall the enemy's movements should be determined by the signs that we\nchoose to give him.\" Note the following anecdote of Sun Pin, a\ndescendent of Sun Wu: In 341 B.C., the Ch'i State being at war with\nWei, sent T'ien Chi and Sun Pin against the general P'ang Chuan, who\nhappened to be a deadly personal enemy of the later. Sun Pin said: \"The\nCh'i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary\ndespises us. Let us turn this circumstance to account.\" Accordingly,\nwhen the army had crossed the border into Wei territory, he gave orders\nto show 100,000 fires on the first night, 50,000 on the next, and the\nnight after only 20,000. P'ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to\nhimself: \"I knew these men of Ch'i were cowards: their numbers have\nalready fallen away by more than half.\" In his retreat, Sun Pin came to\na narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers would reach\nafter dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon\nit the words: \"Under this tree shall P'ang Chuan die.\" Then, as night\nbegan to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by,\nwith orders to shoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P'ang\nChuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in\norder to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled\nby a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion. [The\nabove is Tu Mu's version of the story; the _Shih Chi_, less\ndramatically but probably with more historical truth, makes P'ang Chuan\ncut his own throat with an exclamation of despair, after the rout of\nhis army.] ]\nHe sacrifices something, that the enemy may snatch at it.\n20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march; then with a body\nof picked men he lies in wait for him.\n[With an emendation suggested by Li Ching, this then reads, \"He lies in\nwait with the main body of his troops.\"]\n21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of combined energy, and\ndoes not require too much from individuals.\n[Tu Mu says: \"He first of all considers the power of his army in the\nbulk; afterwards he takes individual talent into account, and uses each\nmen according to his capabilities. He does not demand perfection from\nthe untalented.\"]\nHence his ability to pick out the right men and utilise combined\nenergy.\n22. When he utilises combined energy, his fighting men become as it\nwere like unto rolling logs or stones. For it is the nature of a log or\nstone to remain motionless on level ground, and to move when on a\nslope; if four-cornered, to come to a standstill, but if round-shaped,\nto go rolling down.\n[Ts'au Kung calls this \"the use of natural or inherent power.\"]\n23. Thus the energy developed by good fighting men is as the momentum\nof a round stone rolled down a mountain thousands of feet in height. So\nmuch on the subject of energy.\n[The chief lesson of this chapter, in Tu Mu's opinion, is the paramount\nimportance in war of rapid evolutions and sudden rushes. \"Great\nresults,\" he adds, \"can thus be achieved with small forces.\"]",

WEAK POINTS AND STRONG\n[Chang Yu attempts to explain the sequence of chapters as follows:\n\"Chapter IV, on Tactical Dispositions, treated of the offensive and the\ndefensive; chapter V, on Energy, dealt with direct and indirect\nmethods. The good general acquaints himself first with the theory of\nattack and defence, and then turns his attention to direct and indirect\nmethods. He studies the art of varying and combining these two methods\nbefore proceeding to the subject of weak and strong points. For the use\nof direct or indirect methods arises out of attack and defence, and the\nperception of weak and strong points depends again on the above\nmethods. Hence the present chapter comes immediately after the chapter\non Energy.\"]\n1. Sun Tz\u016d said: Whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of\nthe enemy, will be fresh for the fight; whoever is second in the field\nand has to hasten to battle, will arrive exhausted.\n2. Therefore the clever combatant imposes his will on the enemy, but\ndoes not allow the enemy's will to be imposed on him.\n[One mark of a great soldier is that he fight on his own terms or\nfights not at all. [1] ]\n3. By holding out advantages to him, he can cause the enemy to approach\nof his own accord; or, by inflicting damage, he can make it impossible\nfor the enemy to draw near.\n[In the first case, he will entice him with a bait; in the second, he\nwill strike at some important point which the enemy will have to\ndefend.]\n4. If the enemy is taking his ease, he can harass him;\n[This passage may be cited as evidence against Mei Yao- Ch'en's\ninterpretation of I. \u00a7 23.]\nif well supplied with food, he can starve him out; if quietly encamped,\nhe can force him to move.\n5. Appear at points which the enemy must hasten to defend; march\nswiftly to places where you are not expected.\n6. An army may march great distances without distress, if it marches\nthrough country where the enemy is not.\n[Ts'ao Kung sums up very well: \"Emerge from the void [q.d. like \"a bolt\nfrom the blue\"], strike at vulnerable points, shun places that are\ndefended, attack in unexpected quarters.\"]\n7. You can be sure of succeeding in your attacks if you only attack\nplaces which are undefended.\n[Wang Hsi explains \"undefended places\" as \"weak points; that is to say,\nwhere the general is lacking in capacity, or the soldiers in spirit;\nwhere the walls are not strong enough, or the precautions not strict\nenough; where relief comes too late, or provisions are too scanty, or\nthe defenders are variance amongst themselves.\"]\nYou can ensure the safety of your defence if you only hold positions\nthat cannot be attacked.\n[_I.e._, where there are none of the weak points mentioned above. There\nis rather a nice point involved in the interpretation of this later\nclause. Tu Mu, Ch'en Hao, and Mei Yao-ch'en assume the meaning to be:\n\"In order to make your defence quite safe, you must defend _even_ those\nplaces that are not likely to be attacked;\" and Tu Mu adds: \"How much\nmore, then, those that will be attacked.\" Taken thus, however, the\nclause balances less well with the preceding\u2014always a consideration in\nthe highly antithetical style which is natural to the Chinese. Chang\nYu, therefore, seems to come nearer the mark in saying: \"He who is\nskilled in attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heaven [see\nIV. \u00a7 7], making it impossible for the enemy to guard against him. This\nbeing so, the places that I shall attack are precisely those that the\nenemy cannot defend\u2026. He who is skilled in defence hides in the most\nsecret recesses of the earth, making it impossible for the enemy to\nestimate his whereabouts. This being so, the places that I shall hold\nare precisely those that the enemy cannot attack.\"]\n8. Hence that general is skilful in attack whose opponent does not\nknow what to defend; and he is skilful in defence whose opponent does\nnot know what to attack.\n[An aphorism which puts the whole art of war in a nutshell.]\n9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you we learn to be\ninvisible, through you inaudible;\n[Literally, \"without form or sound,\" but it is said of course with\nreference to the enemy.]\nand hence we can hold the enemy's fate in our hands.\n10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if you make for the\nenemy's weak points; you may retire and be safe from pursuit if your\nmovements are more rapid than those of the enemy.\n11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an engagement even\nthough he be sheltered behind a high rampart and a deep ditch. All we\nneed do is attack some other place that he will be obliged to relieve.\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy is the invading party, we can cut his line\nof communications and occupy the roads by which he will have to return;\nif we are the invaders, we may direct our attack against the sovereign\nhimself.\" It is clear that Sun Tz\u016d, unlike certain generals in the late\nBoer war, was no believer in frontal attacks.]\n12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the enemy from engaging\nus even though the lines of our encampment be merely traced out on the\nground. All we need do is to throw something odd and unaccountable in\nhis way.\n[This extremely concise expression is intelligibly paraphrased by Chia\nLin: \"even though we have constructed neither wall nor ditch.\" Li\nCh'uan says: \"we puzzle him by strange and unusual dispositions;\" and\nTu Mu finally clinches the meaning by three illustrative anecdotes\u2014one\nof Chu-ko Liang, who when occupying Yang-p'ing and about to be attacked\nby Ssu-ma I, suddenly struck his colors, stopped the beating of the\ndrums, and flung open the city gates, showing only a few men engaged in\nsweeping and sprinkling the ground. This unexpected proceeding had the\nintended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off\nhis army and retreated. What Sun Tz\u016d is advocating here, therefore, is\nnothing more nor less than the timely use of \"bluff.\"]\n13. By discovering the enemy's dispositions and remaining invisible\nourselves, we can keep our forces concentrated, while the enemy's must\nbe divided.\n[The conclusion is perhaps not very obvious, but Chang Yu (after Mei\nYao-ch'en) rightly explains it thus: \"If the enemy's dispositions are\nvisible, we can make for him in one body; whereas, our own dispositions\nbeing kept secret, the enemy will be obliged to divide his forces in\norder to guard against attack from every quarter.\"]\n14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up\ninto fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate\nparts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.\n15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior\none, our opponents will be in dire straits.\n16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then\nthe enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several\ndifferent points;\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant's victories by\nsaying that \"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering\nwhat he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to\ndo himself.\"]\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers\nwe shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\n17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;\nshould he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he\nstrengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his\nright, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,\nhe will everywhere be weak.\n[In Frederick the Great's _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: \"A\ndefensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those\ngenerals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every\npoint, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,\nhaving only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,\nand acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater.\"]\n18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible\nattacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make\nthese preparations against us.\n[The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson's words, is \"to compel the\nenemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force\nagainst each fraction in turn.\"]\n19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may\nconcentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\n[What Sun Tz\u016d evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of\ndistances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a\ngeneral to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,\nand afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the\nright hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.\nAmong many such successful junctions which military history records,\none of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher\njust at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]\n20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be\nimpotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the\nleft, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the\nvan. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything\nunder a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by\nseveral _li_!\n[The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,\nbut the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an\narmy advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of\nwhich has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the\nvarious detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise\ninstructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be\nable to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu's note may be worth\nquoting here: \"If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to\nconcentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will\nbe forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we\nhold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall\nbe brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support\nwill be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there\nis any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of\nthe army.\"]\n21. Though according to my estimate the soldiers of Y\u00fceh exceed our own\nin number, that shall advantage them nothing in the matter of victory.\nI say then that victory can be achieved.\n[Alas for these brave words! The long feud between the two states ended\nin 473 B.C. with the total defeat of Wu by Kou Chien and its\nincorporation in Y\u00fceh. This was doubtless long after Sun Tz\u016d's death.\nWith his present assertion compare IV. \u00a7 4. Chang Yu is the only one to\npoint out the seeming discrepancy, which he thus goes on to explain:\n\"In the chapter on Tactical Dispositions it is said, 'One may _know_\nhow to conquer without being able to _do_ it,' whereas here we have the\nstatement that 'victory' can be achieved.' The explanation is, that in\nthe former chapter, where the offensive and defensive are under\ndiscussion, it is said that if the enemy is fully prepared, one cannot\nmake certain of beating him. But the present passage refers\nparticularly to the soldiers of Y\u00fceh who, according to Sun Tz\u016d's\ncalculations, will be kept in ignorance of the time and place of the\nimpending struggle. That is why he says here that victory can be\nachieved.\"]\n22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may prevent him from\nfighting. Scheme so as to discover his plans and the likelihood of\ntheir success.\n[An alternative reading offered by Chia Lin is: \"Know beforehand all\nplans conducive to our success and to the enemy's failure.\"\n23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or inactivity.\n[Chang Yu tells us that by noting the joy or anger shown by the enemy\non being thus disturbed, we shall be able to conclude whether his\npolicy is to lie low or the reverse. He instances the action of Cho-ku\nLiang, who sent the scornful present of a woman's head-dress to Ssu-ma\nI, in order to goad him out of his Fabian tactics.]\nForce him to reveal himself, so as to find out his vulnerable spots.\n24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your own, so that you may\nknow where strength is superabundant and where it is deficient.\n[Cf. IV. \u00a7 6.]\n25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch you can attain\nis to conceal them;\n[The piquancy of the paradox evaporates in translation. Concealment is\nperhaps not so much actual invisibility (see _supra_ \u00a7 9) as \"showing\nno sign\" of what you mean to do, of the plans that are formed in your\nbrain.]\nconceal your dispositions, and you will be safe from the prying of the\nsubtlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.\n[Tu Mu explains: \"Though the enemy may have clever and capable\nofficers, they will not be able to lay any plans against us.\"]\n26. How victory may be produced for them out of the enemy's own\ntactics\u2014that is what the multitude cannot comprehend.\n27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but what none can\nsee is the strategy out of which victory is evolved.\n[_I.e._, everybody can see superficially how a battle is won; what they\ncannot see is the long series of plans and combinations which has\npreceded the battle.]\n28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but\nlet your methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.\n[As Wang Hsi sagely remarks: \"There is but one root-principle\nunderlying victory, but the tactics which lead up to it are infinite in\nnumber.\" With this compare Col. Henderson: \"The rules of strategy are\nfew and simple. They may be learned in a week. They may be taught by\nfamiliar illustrations or a dozen diagrams. But such knowledge will no\nmore teach a man to lead an army like Napoleon than a knowledge of\ngrammar will teach him to write like Gibbon.\"]\n29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its natural\ncourse runs away from high places and hastens downwards.\n30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to strike at what\nis weak.\n[Like water, taking the line of least resistance.]\n31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of the ground over\nwhich it flows; the soldier works out his victory in relation to the\nfoe whom he is facing.\n32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape, so in warfare\nthere are no constant conditions.\n33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his opponent and",

      "text": "Chapter VII. MAN\u0152UVERING\n1. Sun Tz\u016d said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\nsovereign.\n2. Having collected an army and concentrated his forces, he must blend\nand harmonise the different elements thereof before pitching his camp.\n[\"Chang Yu says: \"the establishment of harmony and confidence between\nthe higher and lower ranks before venturing into the field;\" and he\nquotes a saying of Wu Tz\u016d (chap. 1 ad init.): \"Without harmony in the\nState, no military expedition can be undertaken; without harmony in the\narmy, no battle array can be formed.\" In an historical romance Sun Tz\u016d\nis represented as saying to Wu Yuan: \"As a general rule, those who are\nwaging war should get rid of all the domestic troubles before\nproceeding to attack the external foe.\"]\n3. After that, comes tactical man\u0153uvering, than which there is nothing\nmore difficult.\n[I have departed slightly from the traditional interpretation of Ts'ao\nKung, who says: \"From the time of receiving the sovereign's\ninstructions until our encampment over against the enemy, the tactics\nto be pursued are most difficult.\" It seems to me that the tactics or\nman\u0153uvers can hardly be said to begin until the army has sallied forth\nand encamped, and Ch'ien Hao's note gives color to this view: \"For\nlevying, concentrating, harmonizing and entrenching an army, there are\nplenty of old rules which will serve. The real difficulty comes when we\nengage in tactical operations.\" Tu Yu also observes that \"the great\ndifficulty is to be beforehand with the enemy in seizing favourable\nposition.\"]\nThe difficulty of tactical man\u0153uvering consists in turning the devious\ninto the direct, and misfortune into gain.\n[This sentence contains one of those highly condensed and somewhat\nenigmatical expressions of which Sun Tz\u016d is so fond. This is how it is\nexplained by Ts'ao Kung: \"Make it appear that you are a long way off,\nthen cover the distance rapidly and arrive on the scene before your\nopponent.\" Tu Mu says: \"Hoodwink the enemy, so that he may be remiss\nand leisurely while you are dashing along with utmost speed.\" Ho Shih\ngives a slightly different turn: \"Although you may have difficult\nground to traverse and natural obstacles to encounter this is a\ndrawback which can be turned into actual advantage by celerity of\nmovement.\" Signal examples of this saying are afforded by the two\nfamous passages across the Alps\u2014that of Hannibal, which laid Italy at\nhis mercy, and that of Napoleon two thousand years later, which\nresulted in the great victory of Marengo.]\n4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after enticing the enemy\nout of the way, and though starting after him, to contrive to reach the\ngoal before him, shows knowledge of the artifice of _deviation_.\n[Tu Mu cites the famous march of Chao She in 270 B.C. to relieve the\ntown of O-yu, which was closely invested by a Ch'in army. The King of\nChao first consulted Lien P'o on the advisability of attempting a\nrelief, but the latter thought the distance too great, and the\nintervening country too rugged and difficult. His Majesty then turned\nto Chao She, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but\nfinally said: \"We shall be like two rats fighting in a whole\u2014and the\npluckier one will win!\" So he left the capital with his army, but had\nonly gone a distance of 30 _li_ when he stopped and began throwing up\nentrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his\nfortifications, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence\nto the enemy. The Ch'in general was overjoyed, and attributed his\nadversary's tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the\nHan State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory. But the spies\nhad no sooner departed than Chao She began a forced march lasting for\ntwo days and one night, and arrive on the scene of action with such\nastonishing rapidity that he was able to occupy a commanding position\non the \"North hill\" before the enemy had got wind of his movements. A\ncrushing defeat followed for the Ch'in forces, who were obliged to\nraise the siege of O-yu in all haste and retreat across the border.]\n5. Man\u0153uvering with an army is advantageous; with an undisciplined\nmultitude, most dangerous.\n[I adopt the reading of the _T'ung Tien_, Cheng Yu-hsien and the _T'u\nShu_, since they appear to apply the exact nuance required in order to\nmake sense. The commentators using the standard text take this line to\nmean that man\u0153uvers may be profitable, or they may be dangerous: it all\ndepends on the ability of the general.]\n6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to snatch an\nadvantage, the chances are that you will be too late. On the other\nhand, to detach a flying column for the purpose involves the sacrifice\nof its baggage and stores.\n[Some of the Chinese text is unintelligible to the Chinese\ncommentators, who paraphrase the sentence. I submit my own rendering\nwithout much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated\ncorruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tz\u016d does not\napprove of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf.\ninfra, \u00a7 11.]\n7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make\nforced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual\ndistance at a stretch,\n[The ordinary day's march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 _li_; but on one\noccasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts'ao Ts'ao is said to have covered\nthe incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.]\ndoing a hundred _li_ in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all\nyour three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,\nand on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its\ndestination.\n[The moral is, as Ts'ao Kung and others point out: Don't march a\nhundred _li_ to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without\nimpedimenta. Man\u0153uvers of this description should be confined to short\ndistances. Stonewall Jackson said: \"The hardships of forced marches are\noften more painful than the dangers of battle.\" He did not often call\nupon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he\nintended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he\nsacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]\n9. If you march fifty _li_ in order to outman\u0153uver the enemy, you will\nlose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will\nreach the goal.\n[Literally, \"the leader of the first division will be _torn away_.\"]\n10. If you march thirty _li_ with the same object, two-thirds of your\narmy will arrive.\n[In the _T'ung Tien_ is added: \"From this we may know the difficulty of\nman\u0153uvering.\"]\n11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;\nwithout provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.\n[I think Sun Tz\u016d meant \"stores accumulated in d\u00e9p\u00f4ts.\" But Tu Yu says\n\"fodder and the like,\" Chang Yu says \"Goods in general,\" and Wang Hsi\nsays \"fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.\"]\n12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are acquainted with the\ndesigns of our neighbours.\n13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar\nwith the face of the country\u2014its mountains and forests, its pitfalls\nand precipices, its marshes and swamps.\n14. We shall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we\nmake use of local guides.\n[\u00a7\u00a7. 12-14 are repeated in chap. XI. \u00a7 52.]\n15. In war, practise dissimulation, and you will succeed.\n[In the tactics of Turenne, deception of the enemy, especially as to\nthe numerical strength of his troops, took a very prominent position.\n[2] ]\nMove only if there is a real advantage to be gained.\n16. Whether to concentrate or to divide your troops, must be decided by\ncircumstances.\n17. Let your rapidity be that of the wind,\n[The simile is doubly appropriate, because the wind is not only swift\nbut, as Mei Yao-ch'en points out, \"invisible and leaves no tracks.\"]\nyour compactness that of the forest.\n[Meng Shih comes nearer to the mark in his note: \"When slowly marching,\norder and ranks must be preserved\"\u2014so as to guard against surprise\nattacks. But natural forest do not grow in rows, whereas they do\ngenerally possess the quality of density or compactness.]\n18. In raiding and plundering be like fire,\n[Cf. _Shih Ching_, IV. 3. iv. 6: \"Fierce as a blazing fire which no man\ncan check.\"]\nin immovability like a mountain.\n[That is, when holding a position from which the enemy is trying to\ndislodge you, or perhaps, as Tu Yu says, when he is trying to entice\nyou into a trap.]\n19. Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you\nmove, fall like a thunderbolt.\n[Tu Yu quotes a saying of T'ai Kung which has passed into a proverb:\n\"You cannot shut your ears to the thunder or your eyes to the\nlighting\u2014so rapid are they.\" Likewise, an attack should be made so\nquickly that it cannot be parried.]\n20. When you plunder a countryside, let the spoil be divided amongst\nyour men;\n[Sun Tz\u016d wishes to lessen the abuses of indiscriminate plundering by\ninsisting that all booty shall be thrown into a common stock, which may\nafterwards be fairly divided amongst all.]\nwhen you capture new territory, cut it up into allotments for the\nbenefit of the soldiery.\n[Ch'en Hao says \"quarter your soldiers on the land, and let them sow\nand plant it.\" It is by acting on this principle, and harvesting the\nlands they invaded, that the Chinese have succeeded in carrying out\nsome of their most memorable and triumphant expeditions, such as that\nof Pan Ch'ao who penetrated to the Caspian, and in more recent years,\nthose of Fu-k'ang-an and Tso Tsung-t'ang.]\n21. Ponder and deliberate before you make a move.\n[Chang Yu quotes Wei Liao Tz\u016d as saying that we must not break camp\nuntil we have gained the resisting power of the enemy and the\ncleverness of the opposing general. Cf. the \"seven comparisons\" in I. \u00a7\n13.]\n22. He will conquer who has learnt the artifice of deviation.\n[See _supra_, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4.]\nSuch is the art of man\u0153uvering.",

      "text": "[The heading means literally \"The Nine Variations,\" but as Sun Tz\u016d does\nnot appear to enumerate these, and as, indeed, he has already told us\n(V \u00a7\u00a7 6-11) that such deflections from the ordinary course are\npractically innumerable, we have little option but to follow Wang Hsi,\nwho says that \"Nine\" stands for an indefinitely large number. \"All it\nmeans is that in warfare we ought to vary our tactics to the utmost\ndegree\u2026. I do not know what Ts'ao Kung makes these Nine Variations out\nto be, but it has been suggested that they are connected with the Nine\nSituations\" - of chapt. XI. This is the view adopted by Chang Yu. The\nonly other alternative is to suppose that something has been lost\u2014a\nsupposition to which the unusual shortness of the chapter lends some\nweight.]\n1. Sun Tz\u016d said: In war, the general receives his commands from the\nsovereign, collects his army and concentrates his forces.\n[Repeated from VII. \u00a7 1, where it is certainly more in place. It may\nhave been interpolated here merely in order to supply a beginning to\nthe chapter.]\n2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country where high\nroads intersect, join hands with your allies. Do not linger in\ndangerously isolated positions.\n[The last situation is not one of the Nine Situations as given in the\nbeginning of chap. XI, but occurs later on (ibid. \u00a7 43. q.v.). Chang Yu\ndefines this situation as being situated across the frontier, in\nhostile territory. Li Ch'uan says it is \"country in which there are no\nsprings or wells, flocks or herds, vegetables or firewood;\" Chia Lin,\n\"one of gorges, chasms and precipices, without a road by which to\nadvance.\"]\nIn hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In a desperate\nposition, you must fight.\n3. There are roads which must not be followed,\n[\"Especially those leading through narrow defiles,\" says Li Ch'uan,\n\"where an ambush is to be feared.\"]\narmies which must be not attacked,\n[More correctly, perhaps, \"there are times when an army must not be\nattacked.\" Ch'en Hao says: \"When you see your way to obtain a rival\nadvantage, but are powerless to inflict a real defeat, refrain from\nattacking, for fear of overtaxing your men's strength.\"]\ntowns which must not be besieged,\n[Cf. III. \u00a7 4 Ts'ao Kung gives an interesting illustration from his own\nexperience. When invading the territory of Hsu-chou, he ignored the\ncity of Hua-pi, which lay directly in his path, and pressed on into the\nheart of the country. This excellent strategy was rewarded by the\nsubsequent capture of no fewer than fourteen important district cities.\nChang Yu says: \"No town should be attacked which, if taken, cannot be\nheld, or if left alone, will not cause any trouble.\" Hsun Ying, when\nurged to attack Pi-yang, replied: \"The city is small and\nwell-fortified; even if I succeed intaking it, it will be no great feat\nof arms; whereas if I fail, I shall make myself a laughing-stock.\" In\nthe seventeenth century, sieges still formed a large proportion of war.\nIt was Turenne who directed attention to the importance of marches,\ncountermarches and man\u0153uvers. He said: \"It is a great mistake to waste\nmen in taking a town when the same expenditure of soldiers will gain a\nprovince.\" [1] ]\npositions which must not be contested, commands of the sovereign which\nmust not be obeyed.\n[This is a hard saying for the Chinese, with their reverence for\nauthority, and Wei Liao Tz\u016d (quoted by Tu Mu) is moved to exclaim:\n\"Weapons are baleful instruments, strife is antagonistic to virtue, a\nmilitary commander is the negation of civil order!\" The unpalatable\nfact remains, however, that even Imperial wishes must be subordinated\nto military necessity.]\n4. The general who thoroughly understands the advantages that accompany\nvariation of tactics knows how to handle his troops.\n5. The general who does not understand these, may be well acquainted\nwith the configuration of the country, yet he will not be able to turn\nhis knowledge to practical account.\n[Literally, \"get the advantage of the ground,\" which means not only\nsecuring good positions, but availing oneself of natural advantages in\nevery possible way. Chang Yu says: \"Every kind of ground is\ncharacterized by certain natural features, and also gives scope for a\ncertain variability of plan. How it is possible to turn these natural\nfeatures to account unless topographical knowledge is supplemented by\nversatility of mind?\"]\n6. So, the student of war who is unversed in the art of war of varying\nhis plans, even though he be acquainted with the Five Advantages, will\nfail to make the best use of his men.\n[Chia Lin tells us that these imply five obvious and generally\nadvantageous lines of action, namely: \"if a certain road is short, it\nmust be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a\ntown is in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can\nbe stormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military\noperations, the ruler's commands must be obeyed.\" But there are\ncircumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages.\nFor instance, \"a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if\nhe knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has\nlaid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may\nbe open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely\nto fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,\" and so on.]\n7. Hence in the wise leader's plans, considerations of advantage and of\ndisadvantage will be blended together.\n[\"Whether in an advantageous position or a disadvantageous one,\" says\nTs'ao Kung, \"the opposite state should be always present to your\nmind.\"]\n8. If our expectation of advantage be tempered in this way, we may\nsucceed in accomplishing the essential part of our schemes.\n[Tu Mu says: \"If we wish to wrest an advantage from the enemy, we must\nnot fix our minds on that alone, but allow for the possibility of the\nenemy also doing some harm to us, and let this enter as a factor into\nour calculations.\"]\n9. If, on the other hand, in the midst of difficulties we are always\nready to seize an advantage, we may extricate ourselves from\nmisfortune.\n[Tu Mu says: \"If I wish to extricate myself from a dangerous position,\nI must consider not only the enemy's ability to injure me, but also my\nown ability to gain an advantage over the enemy. If in my counsels\nthese two considerations are properly blended, I shall succeed in\nliberating myself\u2026. For instance; if I am surrounded by the enemy and\nonly think of effecting an escape, the nervelessness of my policy will\nincite my adversary to pursue and crush me; it would be far better to\nencourage my men to deliver a bold counter-attack, and use the\nadvantage thus gained to free myself from the enemy's toils.\" See the\nstory of Ts'ao Ts'ao, VII. \u00a7 35, note.]\n10. Reduce the hostile chiefs by inflicting damage on them;\n[Chia Lin enumerates several ways of inflicting this injury, some of\nwhich would only occur to the Oriental mind:\u2014\"Entice away the enemy's\nbest and wisest men, so that he may be left without counselors.\nIntroduce traitors into his country, that the government policy may be\nrendered futile. Foment intrigue and deceit, and thus sow dissension\nbetween the ruler and his ministers. By means of every artful\ncontrivance, cause deterioration amongst his men and waste of his\ntreasure. Corrupt his morals by insidious gifts leading him into\nexcess. Disturb and unsettle his mind by presenting him with lovely\nwomen.\" Chang Yu (after Wang Hsi) makes a different interpretation of\nSun Tz\u016d here: \"Get the enemy into a position where he must suffer\ninjury, and he will submit of his own accord.\"]\nand make trouble for them,\n[Tu Mu, in this phrase, in his interpretation indicates that trouble\nshould be made for the enemy affecting their \"possessions,\" or, as we\nmight say, \"assets,\" which he considers to be \"a large army, a rich\nexchequer, harmony amongst the soldiers, punctual fulfillment of\ncommands.\" These give us a whip-hand over the enemy.]\nand keep them constantly engaged;\n[Literally, \"make servants of them.\" Tu Yu says \"prevent them from\nhaving any rest.\"]\nhold out specious allurements, and make them rush to any given point.\n[Meng Shih's note contains an excellent example of the idiomatic use\nof: \"cause them to forget _pien_ (the reasons for acting otherwise than\non their first impulse), and hasten in our direction.\"]\n11. The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the\nenemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the\nchance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made\nour position unassailable.\n12. There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general: (1)\nRecklessness, which leads to destruction;\n[\"Bravery without forethought,\" as Ts'ao Kung analyzes it, which causes\na man to fight blindly and desperately like a mad bull. Such an\nopponent, says Chang Yu, \"must not be encountered with brute force, but\nmay be lured into an ambush and slain.\" Cf. Wu Tz\u016d, chap. IV. ad init.:\n\"In estimating the character of a general, men are wont to pay\nexclusive attention to his courage, forgetting that courage is only one\nout of many qualities which a general should possess. The merely brave\nman is prone to fight recklessly; and he who fights recklessly, without\nany perception of what is expedient, must be condemned.\" Ssu-ma Fa,\ntoo, makes the incisive remark: \"Simply going to one's death does not\nbring about victory.\"]\n(2) cowardice, which leads to capture;\n[Ts'ao Kung defines the Chinese word translated here as \"cowardice\" as\nbeing of the man \"whom timidity prevents from advancing to seize an\nadvantage,\" and Wang Hsi adds \"who is quick to flee at the sight of\ndanger.\" Meng Shih gives the closer paraphrase \"he who is bent on\nreturning alive,\" this is, the man who will never take a risk. But, as\nSun Tz\u016d knew, nothing is to be achieved in war unless you are willing\nto take risks. T'ai Kung said: \"He who lets an advantage slip will\nsubsequently bring upon himself real disaster.\" In 404 A.D., Liu Yu\npursued the rebel Huan Hsuan up the Yangtsze and fought a naval battle\nwith him at the island of Ch'eng-hung. The loyal troops numbered only a\nfew thousands, while their opponents were in great force. But Huan\nHsuan, fearing the fate which was in store for him should be be\novercome, had a light boat made fast to the side of his war-junk, so\nthat he might escape, if necessary, at a moment's notice. The natural\nresult was that the fighting spirit of his soldiers was utterly\nquenched, and when the loyalists made an attack from windward with\nfireships, all striving with the utmost ardor to be first in the fray,\nHuan Hsuan's forces were routed, had to burn all their baggage and fled\nfor two days and nights without stopping. Chang Yu tells a somewhat\nsimilar story of Chao Ying-ch'i, a general of the Chin State who during\na battle with the army of Ch'u in 597 B.C. had a boat kept in readiness\nfor him on the river, wishing in case of defeat to be the first to get\nacross.]\n(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;\n[Tu Mu tells us that Yao Hsing, when opposed in 357 A.D. by Huang Mei,\nTeng Ch'iang and others shut himself up behind his walls and refused to\nfight. Teng Ch'iang said: \"Our adversary is of a choleric temper and\neasily provoked; let us make constant sallies and break down his walls,\nthen he will grow angry and come out. Once we can bring his force to\nbattle, it is doomed to be our prey.\" This plan was acted upon, Yao\nHsiang came out to fight, was lured as far as San-yuan by the enemy's\npretended flight, and finally attacked and slain.]\n(4) a delicacy of honour which is sensitive to shame;\nThis need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect\nin a general. What Sun Tz\u016d condemns is rather an exaggerated\nsensitiveness to slanderous reports, the thin-skinned man who is stung\nby opprobrium, however undeserved. Mei Yao-ch'en truly observes, though\nsomewhat paradoxically: \"The seeker after glory should be careless of\npublic opinion.\"]\n(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and\ntrouble.\n[Here again, Sun Tz\u016d does not mean that the general is to be careless\nof the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasize is the danger\nof sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate\ncomfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long\nrun the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the\nprolongation of the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken\nfeeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered\ncity, or to reinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his\nmilitary instincts. It is now generally admitted that our repeated\nefforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so many\nstrategical blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end,\nrelief came through the very man who started out with the distinct\nresolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to\nsentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our generals who\nfailed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I remember, to\ndefend him to me on the ground that he was always \"so good to his men.\"\nBy this plea, had he but known it, he was only condemning him out of\nSun Tz\u016d's mouth.]",

After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.\n[\"In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you,\" according to Ts'ao\nKung, and also, says Chang Yu, \"in order not to be impeded in your\nevolutions.\" The _T'ung Tien_ reads, \"If _the enemy_ crosses a river,\"\netc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly an\ninterpolation.]\n4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not\nadvance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army\nget across, and then deliver your attack.\n[Li Ch'uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu\nat the Wei River. Turning to the _Ch'ien Han Shu_, ch. 34, fol. 6\nverso, we find the battle described as follows: \"The two armies were\ndrawn up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered\nhis men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct\na dam higher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung\nChu; but after a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he\nhastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated by this\nunlooked-for success, and exclaiming: \"I felt sure that Han Hsin was\nreally a coward!\" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his\nturn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus\nreleasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the\ngreater portion of Lung Chu's army from getting across. He then turned\nupon the force which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu\nhimself being amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further\nbank, also scattered and fled in all directions.]\n5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader\nnear a river which he has to cross.\n[For fear of preventing his crossing.]\n6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.\n[See _supra_, \u00a7 2. The repetition of these words in connection with\nwater is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: \"Said either of troops\nmarshalled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself;\nin either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing\nthe sun.\" The other commentators are not at all explicit.]\nDo not move up-stream to meet the enemy.\n[Tu Mu says: \"As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on\nthe lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the\nsluices and sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that\n'in river warfare we must not advance against the stream,' which is as\nmuch as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the\nenemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and\nmake short work of us.\" There is also the danger, noted by other\ncommentators, that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be\ncarried down to us.]\nSo much for river warfare.",

Baden-Powell: \"As you\nmove along, say, in a hostile country, your eyes should be looking afar\nfor the enemy or any signs of him: figures, dust rising, birds getting\nup, glitter of arms, etc.\" [1] ]\nWhen it branches out in different directions, it shows that parties\nhave been sent to collect firewood. A few clouds of dust moving to and\nfro signify that the army is encamping.\n[Chang Yu says: \"In apportioning the defences for a cantonment, light\nhorse will be sent out to survey the position and ascertain the weak\nand strong points all along its circumference. Hence the small quantity\nof dust and its motion.\"]\n24. Humble words and increased preparations are signs that the enemy is\nabout to advance.\n[\"As though they stood in great fear of us,\" says Tu Mu. \"Their object\nis to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack\nus.\" Chang Yu alludes to the story of T'ien Tan of the Ch'i-mo against\nthe Yen forces, led by Ch'i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the _Shih Chi_ we read:\n\"T'ien Tan openly said: 'My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off\nthe noses of their Ch'i prisoners and place them in the front rank to\nfight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.' The other\nside being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion;\nbut those within the city were enraged at seeing their\nfellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should\nfall into the enemy's hands, were nerved to defend themselves more\nobstinately than ever. Once again T'ien Tan sent back converted spies\nwho reported these words to the enemy: \"What I dread most is that the\nmen of Yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by\ninflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become\nfaint-hearted.' Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and\nburned the corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo,\nwitnessing the outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were\nall impatient to go out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold.\nT'ien Tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise.\nBut instead of a sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and\nordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the\nranks were filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served\nout all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The\nregular soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were\nmanned with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys\nwere dispatched to the enemy's camp to arrange terms of surrender,\nwhereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy. T'ien Tan also collected\n20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the wealthy citizens\nof Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the prayer that, when the\ntown capitulated, he would not allow their homes to be plundered or\ntheir women to be maltreated. Ch'i Chieh, in high good humor, granted\ntheir prayer; but his army now became increasingly slack and careless.\nMeanwhile, T'ien Tan got together a thousand oxen, decked them with\npieces of red silk, painted their bodies, dragon-like, with colored\nstripes, and fastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased\nrushes on their tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the\nrushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had\npierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked\nwarriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the\nenemy's camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for\ntheir tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their\nbodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom\nthey came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had crept up\nwith gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on the enemy. At\nthe same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself, all those\nthat remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums\nand hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed\nby the uproar. Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in disorder, hotly\npursued by the men of Ch'i, who succeeded in slaying their general Ch'i\nChien\u2026. The result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some\nseventy cities which had belonged to the Ch'i State.\"]\nViolent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that\nhe will retreat.\n25. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on\nthe wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.\n26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.\n[The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch'uan indicates \"a treaty confirmed\nby oaths and hostages.\" Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other hand,\nsimply say \"without reason,\" \"on a frivolous pretext.\"]\n27. When there is much running about\n[Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental\nbanner.]\nand the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has\ncome.\n28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.\n29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint\nfrom want of food.\n30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves,\nthe army is suffering from thirst.\n[As Tu Mu remarks: \"One may know the condition of a whole army from the\nbehavior of a single man.\"]\n31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to\nsecure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\n32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.\n[A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch'en Hao says,\nthe enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.]\nClamour by night betokens nervousness.\n33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is\nweak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If\nthe officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.\n[Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: \"If all the officers of an\narmy are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with\nfatigue\" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.]\n34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for\nfood,\n[In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and\nthe horses chiefly on grass.]\nand when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires,\nshowing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that\nthey are determined to fight to the death.\n[I may quote here the illustrative passage from the _Hou Han Shu_, ch.\n71, given in abbreviated form by the _P'ei Wen Yun Fu:_ \"The rebel Wang\nKuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch'en- ts'ang, and Huang-fu\nSung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out against\nhim. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear\nto his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to\nthrow down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to\nthe attack, but Cho said: 'It is a principle of war not to pursue\ndesperate men and not to press a retreating host.' Sung answered: 'That\ndoes not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a\nretreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized\nmultitude, not a band of desperate men.' Thereupon he advances to the\nattack unsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo\nbeing slain.\"]\n35. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in\nsubdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.\n36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his\nresources;\n[Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always\na fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good\ntemper.]\ntoo many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.\n[Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity\nis necessary to keep the men to their duty.]",

To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's\nnumbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.\n[I follow the interpretation of Ts'ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch'uan,\nTu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia\nLin, Mei Tao-ch'en and Wang Hsi, is: \"The general who is first\ntyrannical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny,\netc.\" This would connect the sentence with what went before about\nrewards and punishments.]\n38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign\nthat the enemy wishes for a truce.\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages,\nit is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either because\ntheir strength is exhausted or for some other reason.\" But it hardly\nneeds a Sun Tz\u016d to draw such an obvious inference.]\n39. If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a\nlong time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again,\nthe situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.\n[Ts'ao Kung says a man\u0153uver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain\ntime for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.]\n40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply\nsufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.\n[Literally, \"no martial advance.\" That is to say, _cheng_ tactics and\nfrontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.]\nWhat we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength,\nkeep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.\n[This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in\nsqueezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch'uan, who appears to\noffer the simplest explanation: \"Only the side that gets more men will\nwin.\" Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in\nlanguage which is lucidity itself: \"When the numbers are even, and no\nfavourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough\nto deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst\nour sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and\nkeeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But\nwe must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us.\" He then quotes\nfrom Wei Liao Tz\u016d, ch. 3: \"The nominal strength of mercenary troops may\nbe 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that\nfigure.\"]\n41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is\nsure to be captured by them.\n[Ch'en Hao, quoting from the _Tso Chuan_, says: \"If bees and scorpions\ncarry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent,\nthen, should not be treated with contempt.\"]\n42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you,\nthey will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be\npractically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,\npunishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.\n43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with\nhumanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.\n[Yen Tz\u016d [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: \"His civil virtues\nendeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in\nawe.\" Cf. Wu Tz\u016d, ch. 4 init.: \"The ideal commander unites culture with\na warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination of\nhardness and tenderness.\"]\nThis is a certain road to victory.\n44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army\nwill be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\n45. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his\norders being obeyed,\n[Tu Mu says: \"A general ought in time of peace to show kindly\nconfidence in his men and also make his authority respected, so that\nwhen they come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline\nmaintained, because they all trust and look up to him.\" What Sun Tz\u016d\nhas said in \u00a7 44, however, would lead one rather to expect something\nlike this: \"If a general is always confident that his orders will be\ncarried out,\" etc.\"]\nthe gain will be mutual.\n[Chang Yu says: \"The general has confidence in the men under his\ncommand, and the men are docile, having confidence in him. Thus the\ngain is mutual.\" He quotes a pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tz\u016d, ch.\n4: \"The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders\nand not to be swayed by petty doubts.\" Vacillation and fussiness are\nthe surest means of sapping the confidence of an army.]\n[1] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 26.",

      "text": "1. Sun Tz\u016d said: We may distinguish six kinds of terrain, to wit: (1)\nAccessible ground;\n[Mei Yao-ch'en says: \"plentifully provided with roads and means of\ncommunications.\"]\n(2) entangling ground;\n[The same commentator says: \"Net-like country, venturing into which you\nbecome entangled.\"]\n(3) temporising ground;\n[Ground which allows you to \"stave off\" or \"delay.\"]\n(4) narrow passes; (5) precipitous heights; (6) positions at a great\ndistance from the enemy.\n[It is hardly necessary to point out the faultiness of this\nclassification. A strange lack of logical perception is shown in the\nChinaman's unquestioning acceptance of glaring cross-divisions such as\nthe above.]\n2. Ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called\n_accessible_.\n3. With regard to ground of this nature, be before the enemy in\noccupying the raised and sunny spots, and carefully guard your line of\nsupplies.\n[The general meaning of the last phrase is doubtlessly, as Tu Yu says,\n\"not to allow the enemy to cut your communications.\" In view of\nNapoleon's dictum, \"the secret of war lies in the communications,\" [1]\nwe could wish that Sun Tz\u016d had done more than skirt the edge of this\nimportant subject here and in I. \u00a7 10, VII. \u00a7 11. Col. Henderson says:\n\"The line of supply may be said to be as vital to the existence of an\narmy as the heart to the life of a human being. Just as the duelist who\nfinds his adversary's point menacing him with certain death, and his\nown guard astray, is compelled to conform to his adversary's movements,\nand to content himself with warding off his thrusts, so the commander\nwhose communications are suddenly threatened finds himself in a false\nposition, and he will be fortunate if he has not to change all his\nplans, to split up his force into more or less isolated detachments,\nand to fight with inferior numbers on ground which he has not had time\nto prepare, and where defeat will not be an ordinary failure, but will\nentail the ruin or surrender of his whole army.\" [2]\nThen you will be able to fight with advantage.\n4. Ground which can be abandoned but is hard to re-occupy is called\n_entangling_.\n5. From a position of this sort, if the enemy is unprepared, you may\nsally forth and defeat him. But if the enemy is prepared for your\ncoming, and you fail to defeat him, then, return being impossible,\ndisaster will ensue.\n6. When the position is such that neither side will gain by making the\nfirst move, it is called _temporising_ ground.\n[Tu Mu says: \"Each side finds it inconvenient to move, and the\nsituation remains at a deadlock.\"]\n7. In a position of this sort, even though the enemy should offer us an\nattractive bait,\n[Tu Yu says, \"turning their backs on us and pretending to flee.\" But\nthis is only one of the lures which might induce us to quit our\nposition.]\nit will be advisable not to stir forth, but rather to retreat, thus\nenticing the enemy in his turn; then, when part of his army has come\nout, we may deliver our attack with advantage.\n8. With regard to _narrow passes_, if you can occupy them first, let\nthem be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy.\n[Because then, as Tu Yu observes, \"the initiative will lie with us, and\nby making sudden and unexpected attacks we shall have the enemy at our\nmercy.\"]\n9. Should the enemy forestall you in occupying a pass, do not go after\nhim if the pass is fully garrisoned, but only if it is weakly\ngarrisoned.\n10. With regard to _precipitous heights_, if you are beforehand with\nyour adversary, you should occupy the raised and sunny spots, and there\nwait for him to come up.\n[Ts'ao Kung says: \"The particular advantage of securing heights and\ndefiles is that your actions cannot then be dictated by the enemy.\"\n[For the enunciation of the grand principle alluded to, see VI. \u00a7 2].\nChang Yu tells the following anecdote of P'ei Hsing-chien (A.D.\n619-682), who was sent on a punitive expedition against the Turkic\ntribes. \"At night he pitched his camp as usual, and it had already been\ncompletely fortified by wall and ditch, when suddenly he gave orders\nthat the army should shift its quarters to a hill near by. This was\nhighly displeasing to his officers, who protested loudly against the\nextra fatigue which it would entail on the men. P'ei Hsing-chien,\nhowever, paid no heed to their remonstrances and had the camp moved as\nquickly as possible. The same night, a terrific storm came on, which\nflooded their former place of encampment to the depth of over twelve\nfeet. The recalcitrant officers were amazed at the sight, and owned\nthat they had been in the wrong. 'How did you know what was going to\nhappen?' they asked. P'ei Hsing-chien replied: 'From this time forward\nbe content to obey orders without asking unnecessary questions.' From\nthis it may be seen,\" Chang Yu continues, \"that high and sunny places\nare advantageous not only for fighting, but also because they are\nimmune from disastrous floods.\"]\n11. If the enemy has occupied them before you, do not follow him, but\nretreat and try to entice him away.\n[The turning point of Li Shih-min's campaign in 621 A.D. against the\ntwo rebels, Tou Chien-te, King of Hsia, and Wang Shih-ch'ung, Prince of\nCheng, was his seizure of the heights of Wu-lao, in spite of which Tou\nChien-te persisted in his attempt to relieve his ally in Lo-yang, was\ndefeated and taken prisoner. See _Chiu T'ang Shu_, ch. 2, fol. 5 verso,\nand also ch. 54.]\n12. If you are situated at a great distance from the enemy, and the\nstrength of the two armies is equal, it is not easy to provoke a\nbattle,\n[The point is that we must not think of undertaking a long and\nwearisome march, at the end of which, as Tu Yu says, \"we should be\nexhausted and our adversary fresh and keen.\"]\nand fighting will be to your disadvantage.\n13.

Now an army is exposed to six several calamities, not arising from\nnatural causes, but from faults for which the general is responsible.\nThese are: (1) Flight; (2) insubordination; (3) collapse; (4) ruin; (5)\ndisorganisation; (6) rout.\n15. Other conditions being equal, if one force is hurled against\nanother ten times its size, the result will be the _flight_ of the\nformer.\n16. When the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too\nweak, the result is _insubordination_.\n[Tu Mu cites the unhappy case of T'ien Pu [_Hsin T'ang Shu_, ch. 148],\nwho was sent to Wei in 821 A.D. with orders to lead an army against\nWang T'ing-ts'ou. But the whole time he was in command, his soldiers\ntreated him with the utmost contempt, and openly flouted his authority\nby riding about the camp on donkeys, several thousands at a time. T'ien\nPu was powerless to put a stop to this conduct, and when, after some\nmonths had passed, he made an attempt to engage the enemy, his troops\nturned tail and dispersed in every direction. After that, the\nunfortunate man committed suicide by cutting his throat.]\nWhen the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak, the\nresult is _collapse_.\n[Ts'ao Kung says: \"The officers are energetic and want to press on, the\ncommon soldiers are feeble and suddenly collapse.\"]\n17. When the higher officers are angry and insubordinate, and on\nmeeting the enemy give battle on their own account from a feeling of\nresentment, before the commander-in-chief can tell whether or no he is\nin a position to fight, the result is _ruin_.\n[Wang Hsi's note is: \"This means, the general is angry without cause,\nand at the same time does not appreciate the ability of his subordinate\nofficers; thus he arouses fierce resentment and brings an avalanche of\nruin upon his head.\"]\n18. When the general is weak and without authority; when his orders are\nnot clear and distinct;\n[Wei Liao Tz\u016d (ch. 4) says: \"If the commander gives his orders with\ndecision, the soldiers will not wait to hear them twice; if his moves\nare made without vacillation, the soldiers will not be in two minds\nabout doing their duty.\" General Baden-Powell says, italicizing the\nwords: \"The secret of getting successful work out of your trained men\nlies in one nutshell\u2014in the clearness of the instructions they\nreceive.\" [3] Cf. also Wu Tz\u016d ch. 3: \"the most fatal defect in a\nmilitary leader is difference; the worst calamities that befall an army\narise from hesitation.\"]\nwhen there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men,\n[Tu Mu says: \"Neither officers nor men have any regular routine.\"]\nand the ranks are formed in a slovenly haphazard manner, the result is\nutter _disorganisation_.\n19. When a general, unable to estimate the enemy's strength, allows an\ninferior force to engage a larger one, or hurls a weak detachment\nagainst a powerful one, and neglects to place picked soldiers in the\nfront rank, the result must be a _rout_.\n[Chang Yu paraphrases the latter part of the sentence and continues:\n\"Whenever there is fighting to be done, the keenest spirits should be\nappointed to serve in the front ranks, both in order to strengthen the\nresolution of our own men and to demoralize the enemy.\" Cf. the primi\nordines of Caesar (\"De Bello Gallico,\" V. 28, 44, et al.).]\n20. These are six ways of courting defeat, which must be carefully\nnoted by the general who has attained a responsible post.",

If fighting is sure to result in victory, then you must fight, even\nthough the ruler forbid it; if fighting will not result in victory,\nthen you must not fight even at the ruler's bidding.\n[Cf. VIII. \u00a7 3 fin. Huang Shih-kung of the Ch'in dynasty, who is said\nto have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the _San\nLueh_, has these words attributed to him: \"The responsibility of\nsetting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance\nand retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will\nhardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened\nmonarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their country's\ncause [lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel].\" This means that\n\"in matters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military\ncommander must be absolute.\" Chang Yu also quote the saying: \"Decrees\nfrom the Son of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp.\"]\n24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without\nfearing disgrace,\n[It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for\na soldier is to retreat.]\nwhose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for\nhis sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.\n[A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese \"happy warrior.\"\nSuch a man, says Ho Shih, \"even if he had to suffer punishment, would\nnot regret his conduct.\"]\n25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you\ninto the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and\nthey will stand by you even unto death.\n[Cf. I. \u00a7 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging picture\nof the famous general Wu Ch'i, from whose treatise on war I have\nfrequently had occasion to quote: \"He wore the same clothes and ate the\nsame food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to have either a\nhorse to ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own surplus rations\nwrapped in a parcel, and shared every hardship with his men. One of his\nsoldiers was suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch'i himself sucked out\nthe virus. The soldier's mother, hearing this, began wailing and\nlamenting. Somebody asked her, saying: 'Why do you cry? Your son is\nonly a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has\nsucked the poison from his sore.' The woman replied, 'Many years ago,\nLord Wu performed a similar service for my husband, who never left him\nafterwards, and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And\nnow that he has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I\nknow not where.'\" Li Ch'uan mentions the Viscount of Ch'u, who invaded\nthe small state of Hsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to\nhim: \"Many of the soldiers are suffering severely from the cold.\" So he\nmade a round of the whole army, comforting and encouraging the men; and\nstraightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined with\nfloss silk.]\n26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority\nfelt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable,\nmoreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to\nspoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.\n[Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you,\nthey would not be afraid of the enemy. Tu Mu recalls an instance of\nstern military discipline which occurred in 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was\noccupying the town of Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his\narmy not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by\nforce. Nevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who\nhappened to be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat\nbelonging to one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation\nhelmet as a protection against the rain. Lu Meng considered that the\nfact of his being also a native of Ju-nan should not be allowed to\npalliate a clear breach of discipline, and accordingly he ordered his\nsummary execution, the tears rolling down his face, however, as he did\nso. This act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from\nthat time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked\nup.]\n27. If we know that our own men are in a condition to attack, but are\nunaware that the enemy is not open to attack, we have gone only halfway\ntowards victory.\n[That is, Ts'ao Kung says, \"the issue in this case is uncertain.\"]\n28. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, but are unaware that\nour own men are not in a condition to attack, we have gone only halfway\ntowards victory.\n[Cf. III. \u00a7 13 (1).]\n29. If we know that the enemy is open to attack, and also know that our\nmen are in a condition to attack, but are unaware that the nature of\nthe ground makes fighting impracticable, we have still gone only\nhalfway towards victory.\n30. Hence the experienced soldier, once in motion, is never bewildered;\nonce he has broken camp, he is never at a loss.\n[The reason being, according to Tu Mu, that he has taken his measures\nso thoroughly as to ensure victory beforehand. \"He does not move\nrecklessly,\" says Chang Yu, \"so that when he does move, he makes no\nmistakes.\"]\n31. Hence the saying: If you know the enemy and know yourself, your\nvictory will not stand in doubt; if you know Heaven and know Earth, you\nmay make your victory complete.\n[Li Ch'uan sums up as follows: \"Given a knowledge of three things\u2014the\naffairs of men, the seasons of heaven and the natural advantages of\nearth\u2014, victory will invariably crown your battles.\"]",

Li Ch'uan and others, however, suppose\nthe meaning to be that the enemy has already forestalled us, sot that\nit would be sheer madness to attack. In the _Sun Tz\u016d Hsu Lu_, when the\nKing of Wu inquires what should be done in this case, Sun Tz\u016d replies:\n\"The rule with regard to contentious ground is that those in possession\nhave the advantage over the other side. If a position of this kind is\nsecured first by the enemy, beware of attacking him. Lure him away by\npretending to flee\u2014show your banners and sound your drums\u2014make a dash\nfor other places that he cannot afford to lose\u2014trail brushwood and\nraise a dust\u2014confound his ears and eyes\u2014detach a body of your best\ntroops, and place it secretly in ambuscade. Then your opponent will\nsally forth to the rescue.\"]\n12. On open ground, do not try to block the enemy's way.\n[Because the attempt would be futile, and would expose the blocking\nforce itself to serious risks. There are two interpretations available\nhere. I follow that of Chang Yu. The other is indicated in Ts'ao Kung's\nbrief note: \"Draw closer together\"\u2014i.e., see that a portion of your own\narmy is not cut off.]\nOn ground of intersecting highways, join hands with your allies.\n[Or perhaps, \"form alliances with neighbouring states.\"]\n13. On serious ground, gather in plunder.\n[On this, Li Ch'uan has the following delicious note: \"When an army\npenetrates far into the enemy's country, care must be taken not to\nalienate the people by unjust treatment. Follow the example of the Han\nEmperor Kao Tsu, whose march into Ch'in territory was marked by no\nviolation of women or looting of valuables. [Nota bene: this was in 207\nB.C., and may well cause us to blush for the Christian armies that\nentered Peking in 1900 A.D.] Thus he won the hearts of all. In the\npresent passage, then, I think that the true reading must be, not\n'plunder,' but 'do not plunder.'\" Alas, I fear that in this instance\nthe worthy commentator's feelings outran his judgment. Tu Mu, at least,\nhas no such illusions. He says: \"When encamped on 'serious ground,'\nthere being no inducement as yet to advance further, and no possibility\nof retreat, one ought to take measures for a protracted resistance by\nbringing in provisions from all sides, and keep a close watch on the\nenemy.\"]\nIn difficult ground, keep steadily on the march.\n[Or, in the words of VIII. \u00a7 2, \"do not encamp.]\n14. On hemmed-in ground, resort to stratagem.\n[Ts'au Kung says: \"Try the effect of some unusual artifice;\" and Tu Yu\namplifies this by saying: \"In such a position, some scheme must be\ndevised which will suit the circumstances, and if we can succeed in\ndeluding the enemy, the peril may be escaped.\" This is exactly what\nhappened on the famous occasion when Hannibal was hemmed in among the\nmountains on the road to Casilinum, and to all appearances entrapped by\nthe dictator Fabius. The stratagem which Hannibal devised to baffle his\nfoes was remarkably like that which T'ien Tan had also employed with\nsuccess exactly 62 years before. [See IX. \u00a7 24, note.] When night came\non, bundles of twigs were fastened to the horns of some 2000 oxen and\nset on fire, the terrified animals being then quickly driven along the\nmountain side towards the passes which were beset by the enemy. The\nstrange spectacle of these rapidly moving lights so alarmed and\ndiscomfited the Romans that they withdrew from their position, and\nHannibal's army passed safely through the defile. [See Polybius, III.\n93, 94; Livy, XXII. 16 17.]\nOn desperate ground, fight.\n[For, as Chia Lin remarks: \"if you fight with all your might, there is\na chance of life; where as death is certain if you cling to your\ncorner.\"]\n15.

Rapidity is the essence of war:\n[According to Tu Mu, \"this is a summary of leading principles in\nwarfare,\" and he adds: \"These are the profoundest truths of military\nscience, and the chief business of the general.\" The following\nanecdotes, told by Ho Shih, shows the importance attached to speed by\ntwo of China's greatest generals. In 227 A.D., Meng Ta, governor of\nHsin-ch'eng under the Wei Emperor Wen Ti, was meditating defection to\nthe House of Shu, and had entered into correspondence with Chu-ko\nLiang, Prime Minister of that State. The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then\nmilitary governor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta's treachery, he\nat once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt, having\npreviously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import.\nSsu-ma's officers came to him and said: \"If Meng Ta has leagued himself\nwith Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we\nmake a move.\" Ssu-ma I replied: \"Meng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we\nought to go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and\nbefore he has thrown off the mask.\" Then, by a series of forced\nmarches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch'eng with in a\nspace of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\nChu-ko Liang: \"Wan is 1200 _li_ from here. When the news of my revolt\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it\nwill be a whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time\nmy city will be well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come\nhimself, and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth\ntroubling about.\" The next letter, however, was filled with\nconsternation: \"Though only eight days have passed since I threw off my\nallegiance, an army is already at the city-gates. What miraculous\nrapidity is this!\" A fortnight later, Hsin- ch'eng had fallen and Meng\nTa had lost his head. [See _Chin Shu_, ch. 1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li\nChing was sent from K'uei-chou in Ssu-ch'uan to reduce the successful\nrebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at the modern Ching-chou\nFu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being then in flood, Hsiao\nHsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture to come down\nthrough the gorges, and consequently made no preparations. But Li Ching\nembarked his army without loss of time, and was just about to start\nwhen the other generals implored him to postpone his departure until\nthe river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li Ching\nreplied: \"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount\nimportance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to\nstrike, before Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army\ntogether. If we seize the present moment when the river is in flood, we\nshall appear before his capital with startling suddenness, like the\nthunder which is heard before you have time to stop your ears against\nit. [See VII. \u00a7 19, note.] This is the great principle in war. Even if\nhe gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in\nsuch a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full\nfruits of victory will be ours.\" All came about as he predicted, and\nHsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that his people",

Carefully study the well-being of your men,\n[For \"well-being\", Wang Hsi means, \"Pet them, humor them, give them\nplenty of food and drink, and look after them generally.\"]\nand do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your\nstrength.\n[Ch'en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the famous\ngeneral Wang Chien, whose military genius largely contributed to the\nsuccess of the First Emperor. He had invaded the Ch'u State, where a\nuniversal levy was made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the\ntemper of his troops, he declined all invitations to fight and remained\nstrictly on the defensive. In vain did the Ch'u general try to force a\nbattle: day after day Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not\ncome out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the\naffection and confidence of his men. He took care that they should be\nwell fed, sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for\nbathing, and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them\ninto a loyal and homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told\noff certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves.\nThe answer was, that they were contending with one another in putting\nthe weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were\nengaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been\nstrung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for\nfighting. By this time the Ch'u army, after repeating their challenge\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch'in\ngeneral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the\nbattle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly\nafterwards, the whole of Ch'u was conquered by Ch'in, and the king\nFu-ch'u led into captivity.]\nKeep your army continually on the move,\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are. It has\nstruck me, however, that the true reading might be \"link your army\ntogether.\"]\nand devise unfathomable plans.\n23. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and\nthey will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is\nnothing they may not achieve.\n[Chang Yu quotes his favourite Wei Liao Tz\u016d (ch. 3): \"If one man were to",

On the day they are ordered out to battle, your soldiers may weep,\n[The word in the Chinese is \"snivel.\" This is taken to indicate more\ngenuine grief than tears alone.]\nthose sitting up bedewing their garments, and those lying down letting\nthe tears run down their cheeks.\n[Not because they are afraid, but because, as Ts'ao Kung says, \"all\nhave embraced the firm resolution to do or die.\" We may remember that\nthe heroes of the Iliad were equally childlike in showing their\nemotion. Chang Yu alludes to the mournful parting at the I River\nbetween Ching K'o and his friends, when the former was sent to attempt\nthe life of the King of Ch'in (afterwards First Emperor) in 227 B.C.\nThe tears of all flowed down like rain as he bade them farewell and\nuttered the following lines: \"The shrill blast is blowing, Chilly the\nburn; Your champion is going\u2014Not to return.\" [1] ]\nBut let them once be brought to bay, and they will display the courage\nof a Chu or a Kuei.\n[Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and\ncontemporary with Sun Tz\u016d himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang,\nbetter known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with\na dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a\nbanquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to\npieces by the king's bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero\nreferred to, Ts'ao Kuei (or Ts'ao Mo), performed the exploit which has\nmade his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice\ndefeated by Ch'i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering\na large slice of territory, when Ts'ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung,\nthe Duke of Ch'i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger\nagainst his chest. None of the duke's retainers dared to move a muscle,\nand Ts'ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu\nwas being unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker\nstate. Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent,\nwhereupon Ts'ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his\nplace amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed\ncolor. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate\nthe bargain, but his wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him\nthe impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold\nstroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched\nbattles.]\n29. The skilful tactician may be likened to the _shuai-jan_. Now the\n_shuai-jan_ is a snake that is found in the Ch'ang mountains.\n[\"_Shuai-jan_\" means \"suddenly\" or \"rapidly,\" and the snake in question\nwas doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through\nthis passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the\nsense of \"military man\u0153uvers.\"]\nStrike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its\ntail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and\nyou will be attacked by head and tail both.\n30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_,\n[That is, as Mei Yao-ch'en says, \"Is it possible to make the front and\nrear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as\nthough they were part of a single living body?\"]\nI should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Y\u00fceh are\nenemies;\n[Cf. VI. \u00a7 21.]\nyet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a\nstorm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand\nhelps the right.\n[The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of\ncommon peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound\ntogether as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet\nit is notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of\ncooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.]\n31. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of\nhorses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.\n[These quaint devices to prevent one's army from running away recall\nthe Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the\nbattle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one\nspot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough, says Sun Tz\u016d, to\nrender flight impossible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed\nunless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a\nspirit of sympathetic cooperation. This is the lesson which can be\nlearned from the _shuai-jan_.]\n32. The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard\nof courage which all must reach.\n[Literally, \"level the courage [of all] as though [it were that of]\none.\" If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it\nfollows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be\nof the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain\nstandard. Wellington's seemingly ungrateful description of his army at\nWaterloo as \"the worst he had ever commanded\" meant no more than that\nit was deficient in this important particular\u2014unity of spirit and\ncourage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept\nthose troops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the\nday.]\n33. How to make the best of both strong and weak\u2014that is a question\ninvolving the proper use of ground.\n[Mei Yao-ch'en's paraphrase is: \"The way to eliminate the differences\nof strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize\naccidental features of the ground.\" Less reliable troops, if posted in\nstrong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more\nexposed terrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority\nin stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: \"With all respect to the\ntext books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to\nthink that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no\nmeans sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions\u2026\nand to the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are\ndefending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural\nfeatures.\" [2] ]\n34. Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were\nleading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\n[Tu Mu says: \"The simile has reference to the ease with which he does\nit.\"]\n35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure\nsecrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.\n36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports\nand appearances,\n[Literally, \"to deceive their eyes and ears.\"]\nand thus keep them in total ignorance.\n[Ts'ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: \"The troops must\nnot be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only\nrejoice with you over their happy outcome.\" \"To mystify, mislead, and\nsurprise the enemy,\" is one of the first principles in war, as had been\nfrequently pointed out. But how about the other process\u2014the\nmystification of one's own men? Those who may think that Sun Tz\u016d is\nover-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson's",

The King of\nKutcha replied by dispatching his chief commander to succour the place\nwith an army drawn from the kingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t'ou,\ntotaling 50,000 men.

The best plan,\nthen, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different\ndirection. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route,\nand I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the\nevening drum has sounded and then start.' Pan Ch'ao now secretly\nreleased the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha\nwas thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set\noff at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch'ao's retreat\nin the west, while the King of Wen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in\norder to intercept the King of Khotan.

Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity\nof purpose.\n[This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the\ndefensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. _supra_, \u00a7 11.]\nOn facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between\nall parts of my army.\n[As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible\ncontingencies: \"(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden\nattack on the part of the enemy.\" Cf. VII. \u00a7 17. Mei Yao-ch'en says:\n\"On the march, the regiments should be in close touch; in an\nencampment, there should be continuity between the fortifications.\"]\n47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.\n[This is Ts'ao Kung's interpretation. Chang Yu adopts it, saying: \"We\nmust quickly bring up our rear, so that head and tail may both reach\nthe goal.\" That is, they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way\napart. Mei Yao-ch'en offers another equally plausible explanation:\n\"Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and we\nare behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to dispute\nits possession.\" Ch'en Hao, on the other hand, assuming that the enemy\nhas had time to select his own ground, quotes VI. \u00a7 1, where Sun Tz\u016d\nwarns us against coming exhausted to the attack. His own idea of the\nsituation is rather vaguely expressed: \"If there is a favourable\nposition lying in front of you, detach a picked body of troops to\noccupy it, then if the enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to make\na fight for it, you may fall quickly on their rear with your main body,\nand victory will be assured.\" It was thus, he adds, that Chao She beat\nthe army of Ch'in. (See p. 57.)]\n48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences. On\nground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.\n49. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of\nsupplies.\n[The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder, not, as\none might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home base.]\nOn difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.\n50. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.\n[Meng Shih says: \"To make it seem that I meant to defend the position,\nwhereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy's\nlines.\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \"in order to make my soldiers fight with\ndesperation.\" Wang Hsi says, \"fearing lest my men be tempted to run\naway.\" Tu Mu points out that this is the converse of VII. \u00a7 36, where\nit is the enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards\nEmperor and canonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under\nErh-chu Chao and others. His own force was comparatively small,\nconsisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot. The\nlines of investment had not been drawn very closely together, gaps\nbeing left at certain points. But Kao Huan, instead of trying to\nescape, actually made a shift to block all the remaining outlets\nhimself by driving into them a number of oxen and donkeys roped\ntogether. As soon as his officers and men saw that there was nothing\nfor it but to conquer or die, their spirits rose to an extraordinary\npitch of exaltation, and they charged with such desperate ferocity that\nthe opposing ranks broke and crumbled under their onslaught.]\nOn desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness\nof saving their lives.\nTu Yu says: \"Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away your stores\nand provisions, choke up the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and\nmake it plain to your men that they cannot survive, but must fight to\nthe death.\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \"The only chance of life lies in giving\nup all hope of it.\" This concludes what Sun Tz\u016d has to say about\n\"grounds\" and the \"variations\" corresponding to them. Reviewing the\npassages which bear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be\nstruck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is\ntreated. Sun Tz\u016d begins abruptly in VIII. \u00a7 2 to enumerate \"variations\"\nbefore touching on \"grounds\" at all, but only mentions five, namely\nnos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is not included\nin it. A few varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion\nof chap. IX, and then chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six\nvariations of plan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though\nthe first is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next\nchapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par\nexcellence, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us down\nto \u00a7 14. In \u00a7\u00a7 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2,\n8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed\nin chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated once\nmore from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7,\nbeing different from those previously given. Though it is impossible to\naccount for the present state of Sun Tz\u016d's text, a few suggestive facts\nmaybe brought into prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title,\nshould deal with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is\nan abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds.\nSeveral of these are defined twice over, besides which there are two\ndistinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the\nchapter is disproportionate, being double that of any other except IX.\nI do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the\ngeneral conclusion that Sun Tz\u016d's work cannot have come down to us in\nthe shape in which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective\nand probably out of place, while XI seems to contain matter that has\neither been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.]\n51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate\nresistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself,\nand to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.",

That surely is the reason. The truly\nwise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to\npass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!' Thereupon\nhe called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service, and\nset a trap for him, saying: 'Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu\nwho arrived some day ago?' The man was so taken aback that between\nsurprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch'ao,\nkeeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a\ngeneral gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began\ndrinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their heads a\nlittle, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them\nthus: 'Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region,\nanxious to achieve riches and honour by some great exploit. Now it\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy\nextended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this\nenvoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the\nHsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert.\nWhat are we to do?' With one accord, the officers replied: 'Standing as\nwe do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life\nand death.' For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. \u00a7 1,\nnote.]\n52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are\nacquainted with their designs.

I prefer to\nregard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the\nfollowing words. With regard to local guides, Sun Tz\u016d might have added\nthat there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their\ntreachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13):\nHannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the\nneighbourhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be\noccupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of\nLatin names, caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of\nCasinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that\ndirection, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost\narrived.]\n53. To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles\ndoes not befit a warlike prince.\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship\nshows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He\noverawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining\nagainst him.\n[Mei Tao-ch'en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so\nmuch affected by the Chinese: \"In attacking a powerful state, if you\ncan divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you\nhave a superiority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you\noverawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will be frightened; and if\nthe neighbouring states are frightened, the enemy's allies will be\nprevented from joining her.\" The following gives a stronger meaning:\n\"If the great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to\nsummon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain\nfrom massing their forces.\" Ch'en Hao and Chang Yu take the sentence in\nquite another way. The former says: \"Powerful though a prince may be,\nif he attacks a large state, he will be unable to raise enough troops,\nand must rely to some extent on external aid; if he dispenses with\nthis, and with overweening confidence in his own strength, simply tries\nto intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\" Chang Yu puts his\nview thus: \"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will\nbe discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the\nother chieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\"]\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor\ndoes he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret\ndesigns, keeping his antagonists in awe.\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch'uan, appears to be this: Secure\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \"he can afford to reject\nentangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his\nprestige enable him to dispense with external friendships.\"]\nThus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.\n[This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch'in State\nbecame a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which\nthe famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final\ntriumph under Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yu, following up his previous note,\nthinks that Sun Tz\u016d is condemning this attitude of cold-blooded\nselfishness and haughty isolation.]",

Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know\nyour design.\n[Literally, \"do not tell them words;\" i.e. do not give your reasons for\nany order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to \"give no\nreasons\" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a\ngeneral than to a judge.]\nWhen the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them\nnothing when the situation is gloomy.\n58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it\ninto desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.\n[These words of Sun Tz\u016d were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of\nthe tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already\nalluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red\nflag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles\nand keep a secret watch on the enemy. \"When the men of Chao see me in\nfull flight,\" Han Hsin said, \"they will abandon their fortifications\nand give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down\nthe Chao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead.\"\nTurning then to his other officers, he remarked: \"Our adversary holds a\nstrong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he\nsees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I\nshould turn back and escape through the mountains.\" So saying, he first\nof all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them\nto form in line of battle with their backs to the River Ti. Seeing this\nman\u0153uver, the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter. By this time\nit was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, displaying the generalissimo's\nflag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately\nengaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time;\nuntil at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and\nbanner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where\nanother fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them\nand to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but\nthe two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the\n2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao\nfollowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls,\ntore up the enemy's flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the\nChao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags\nstruck them with terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and\noverpowered their king, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of\ntheir leader to stay the panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on\nthem from both sides and completed the rout, killing a number and\ncapturing the rest, amongst whom was King Ya himself\u2026. After the\nbattle, some of Han Hsin's officers came to him and said: \"In the _Art\nof War_ we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a\nriver or marsh on the left front. [This appears to be a blend of Sun\nTz\u016d and T'ai Kung. See IX \u00a7 9, and note.] You, on the contrary, ordered\nus to draw up our troops with the river at our back. Under these\nconditions, how did you manage to gain the victory?\" The general\nreplied: \"I fear you gentlemen have not studied the Art of War with\nsufficient care. Is it not written there: 'Plunge your army into\ndesperate straits and it will come off in safety; place it in deadly\nperil and it will survive'? Had I taken the usual course, I should\nnever have been able to bring my colleague round. What says the\nMilitary Classic\u2014'Swoop down on the market-place and drive the men off\nto fight.' [This passage does not occur in the present text of Sun\nTz\u016d.] If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were\nobliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow\nhis own discretion, there would have been a general _d\u00e9bandade_, and it\nwould have been impossible to do anything with them.\" The officers\nadmitted the force of his argument, and said: \"These are higher tactics\nthan we should have been capable of.\" [See _Ch'ien Han Shu_, ch. 34,\nff. 4, 5.] ]\n59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is\ncapable of striking a blow for victory.",

Pan Ch'ao, sent on\na diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. \u00a7 51, note],\nfound himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an\nenvoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In\nconsultation with his officers, he exclaimed: \"Never venture, never\nwin! [1] The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire\non the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to\ndiscern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate\nthem completely; this will cool the King's courage and cover us with\nglory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.' The officers all\nreplied that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the\nIntendant. Pan Ch'ao then fell into a passion: 'It is today,' he cried,\n'that our fortunes must be decided! The Intendant is only a humdrum\ncivilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and\neverything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy\nfate for valiant warriors.' All then agreed to do as he wished.\nAccordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly\nmade their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the\ntime. Pan Ch'ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind\nthe enemy's barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot\nup, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The\nrest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade\nat the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the\nwindward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose\non the front and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in\nfrantic disorder. Pan Ch'ao slew three of them with his own hand, while\nhis companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite.\nThe remainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On\nthe following day, Pan Ch'ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted\nhand: 'Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think,\nSir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.' This satisfied Kuo Hsun,\nand Pan Ch'ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the\nhead of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and\ntrembling, which Pan Ch'ao took steps to allay by issuing a public\nproclamation. Then, taking the king's sons as hostage, he returned to\nmake his report to Tou Ku.\" _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ]",

The latter, taking\nadvantage of a favourable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese\ngeneral's camp, but found that every scrap of combustible vegetation in\nthe neighbourhood had already been burnt down. On the other hand,\nPo-ts'ai, a general of the Yellow Turban rebels, was badly defeated in\n184 A.D. through his neglect of this simple precaution. \"At the head of\na large army he was besieging Ch'ang-she, which was held by Huang-fu\nSung. The garrison was very small, and a general feeling of nervousness\npervaded the ranks; so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together and\nsaid: \"In war, there are various indirect methods of attack, and\nnumbers do not count for everything. [The commentator here quotes Sun\nTz\u016d, V. \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6 and 10.] Now the rebels have pitched their camp in the\nmidst of thick grass which will easily burn when the wind blows. If we\nset fire to it at night, they will be thrown into a panic, and we can\nmake a sortie and attack them on all sides at once, thus emulating the\nachievement of T'ien Tan.' [See p. 90.] That same evening, a strong\nbreeze sprang up; so Huang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind\nreeds together into torches and mount guard on the city walls, after\nwhich he sent out a band of daring men, who stealthily made their way\nthrough the lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells.\nSimultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city walls, and\nHuang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which threw the\nrebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\" [_Hou Han Shu_,\nch. 71.]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from\nthe leeward.\n[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \"When you make a fire, the enemy will\nretreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he\nwill fight desperately, which will not conduce to your success.\" A\nrather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \"If the wind is in\nthe east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the\nattack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side,\nand then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your\nenemy.\"]",

      "text": "11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze\nsoon falls.\n[Cf. Lao Tz\u016d's saying: \"A violent wind does not last the space of a\nmorning.\" (_Tao Te Ching_, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch'en and Wang Hsi say:\n\"A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak.\nThis is what happens as a general rule.\" The phenomenon observed may be\ncorrect enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]\n12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be\nknown, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the\nproper days.\n[Tu Mu says: \"We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars,\nand watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our\nattack with fire.\" Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently:\n\"We must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also\nbe on our guard against similar attacks from them.\"]\n13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;\nthose who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of\nstrength.\n14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of\nall his belongings.\n[Ts'ao Kung's note is: \"We can merely obstruct the enemy's road or\ndivide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores.\" Water\ncan do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of\nfire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is\ndismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is\ndiscussed in detail. Wu Tz\u016d (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements:\n\"If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the\nwater cannot run off, and where the rainfall is heavy, it may be\nsubmerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands\nthickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent\ngales, it may be exterminated by fire.\"]\n15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed\nin his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the\nresult is waste of time and general stagnation.\n[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tz\u016d. Ts'ao Kung\nsays: \"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\"\nAnd Tu Mu: \"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the\ndeserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and\ndisaster will ensue.\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the\nformidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the\ninterpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch'en alone, whose words I will\nquote: \"Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and\nassaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink\non occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to\nsuch means of attack of fire, water and the like. What they must not\ndo, and what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold to the\nadvantages they have got.\"]\n16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead;\nthe good general cultivates his resources.\n[Tu Mu quotes the following from the _San Lueh_, ch. 2: \"The warlike\nprince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by\ngood faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays,\nthere will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not\nbe respected.\"]\n17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless\nthere is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is\ncritical.\n[Sun Tz\u016d may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so\nfar in that direction as the remarkable passage in the _Tao Te Ching_,\nch. 69. \"I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the\ndefensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.\"]\n18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own\nspleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.\n19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where\nyou are.\n[This is repeated from XI. \u00a7 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an\ninterpolation, for it is evident that \u00a7 20 ought to follow immediately\non \u00a7 18.]\n20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by\ncontent.\n21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again\ninto being;\n[The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.]\nnor can the dead ever be brought back to life.\n22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full\nof caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army\nintact.\n[1] \"Unless you enter the tiger's lair, you cannot get hold of the\ntiger's cubs.\"",

On the other hand,\nHsiao Shih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but\ncontrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on.\nSeveral of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition;\nbut that it is not what Sun Tz\u016d meant is conclusively proved by his\nsubsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (\u00a7 21\nsqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used\nwith conspicuous success: (1) by T'ien Tan in his defence of Chi-mo\n(see _supra_, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57);\nand by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P'o was conducting a\ndefensive campaign against Ch'in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved\nof Lien P'o's cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to\navert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to\nthe reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and\nwere already in Fan Chu's pay. They said: \"The only thing which causes\nCh'in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P'o they\nconsider an easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long\nrun.\" Now this Chao Kua was a son of the famous Chao She. From his\nboyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military\nmatters, until at last he came to believe that there was no commander\nin the whole Empire who could stand against him. His father was much\ndisquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he\nspoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if\never Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of\nChao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own\nmother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed\nLien P'o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po\nCh'i and the great military power of Ch'in. He fell into a trap by\nwhich his army was divided into two and his communications cut; and\nafter a desperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished\nsoldiers devoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and\nhis whole force, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put\nto the sword.]",

But, having regard to the context, we can hardly\ndoubt that Sun Tz\u016d is holding up I Chih and Lu Ya as illustrious\nexamples of the converted spy, or something closely analogous.

Hsia\ncould not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not\nemploy the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements\nwere all for the good of the people.\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \"How\nshould two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common\nspies? Sun Tz\u016d's mention of them simply means that the proper use of\nthe five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest\nmental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them\nfor the task.
