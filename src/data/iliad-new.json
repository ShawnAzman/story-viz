The priest being refused, and insolently\ndismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who\ninflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and\nencourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the\nrefusal of Chryse\u00efs. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,\nenters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;\nhowever, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on\nBrise\u00efs in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his\nforces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she\nsupplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her\nson, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit,\nincenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are\nreconciled by the address of Vulcan.\nThe time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine\nduring the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes,\nand twelve for Jupiter's stay with the \u00c6thiopians, at whose return\nThetis prefers her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp,\nthen changes to Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.",

(fair Thetis thus replies,\nWhile tears celestial trickle from her eyes)\nWhy have I borne thee with a mother's throes,\nTo Fates averse, and nursed for future woes?[65]\nSo short a space the light of heaven to view!\nSo short a space! and fill'd with sorrow too!\nO might a parent's careful wish prevail,\nFar, far from Ilion should thy vessels sail,\nAnd thou, from camps remote, the danger shun\nWhich now, alas! too nearly threats my son.\nYet (what I can) to move thy suit I'll go\nTo great Olympus crown'd with fleecy snow.\nMeantime, secure within thy ships, from far\nBehold the field, not mingle in the war.\nThe sire of gods and all the ethereal train,\nOn the warm limits of the farthest main,\nNow mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace\nThe feasts of \u00c6thiopia's blameless race,[66]\nTwelve days the powers indulge the genial rite,\nReturning with the twelfth revolving light.\nThen will I mount the brazen dome, and move\nThe high tribunal of immortal Jove.\"\nThe goddess spoke: the rolling waves unclose;\nThen down the steep she plunged from whence she rose,\nAnd left him sorrowing on the lonely coast,\nIn wild resentment for the fair he lost.\nIn Chrysa's port now sage Ulysses rode;\nBeneath the deck the destined victims stow'd:\nThe sails they furl'd, they lash the mast aside,\nAnd dropp'd their anchors, and the pinnace tied.\nNext on the shore their hecatomb they land;\nChryse\u00efs last descending on the strand.\nHer, thus returning from the furrow'd main,\nUlysses led to Ph\u0153bus' sacred fane;\nWhere at his solemn altar, as the maid\nHe gave to Chryses, thus the hero said:\n\"Hail, reverend priest! to Ph\u0153bus' awful dome\nA suppliant I from great Atrides come:\nUnransom'd, here receive the spotless fair;\nAccept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;\nAnd may thy god who scatters darts around,\nAtoned by sacrifice, desist to wound.\"[67]\nAt this, the sire embraced the maid again,\nSo sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.\nThen near the altar of the darting king,\nDisposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;\nWith water purify their hands, and take\nThe sacred offering of the salted cake;\nWhile thus with arms devoutly raised in air,\nAnd solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:\n\"God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,\nWhose power incircles Cilla the divine;\nWhose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys,\nAnd gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish'd rays!\nIf, fired to vengeance at thy priest's request,\nThy direful darts inflict the raging pest:\nOnce more attend! avert the wasteful woe,\nAnd smile propitious, and unbend thy bow.\"\nSo Chryses pray'd. Apollo heard his prayer:\nAnd now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare;\nBetween their horns the salted barley threw,\nAnd, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:[68]\nThe limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;\nThe thighs, selected to the gods, divide:\nOn these, in double cauls involved with art,\nThe choicest morsels lay from every part.\nThe priest himself before his altar stands,\nAnd burns the offering with his holy hands.\nPours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;\nThe youth with instruments surround the fire:\nThe thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd,\nThe assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:\nThen spread the tables, the repast prepare;\nEach takes his seat, and each receives his share.\nWhen now the rage of hunger was repress'd,\nWith pure libations they conclude the feast;\nThe youths with wine the copious goblets crown'd,[69]\nAnd, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around\nWith hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,\nThe p\u00e6ans lengthen'd till the sun descends:\nThe Greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;\nApollo listens, and approves the song.\n'Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,\nTill rosy morn had purpled o'er the sky:\nThen launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,\nSupplied by Ph\u0153bus, fill the swelling sails;\nThe milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,\nThe parted ocean foams and roars below:\nAbove the bounding billows swift they flew,\nTill now the Grecian camp appear'd in view.\nFar on the beach they haul their bark to land,\n(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)\nThen part, where stretch'd along the winding bay,\nThe ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.\nBut raging still, amidst his navy sat\nThe stern Achilles, stedfast in his hate;\nNor mix'd in combat, nor in council join'd;\nBut wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:\nIn his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,\nAnd scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.\nTwelve days were past, and now the dawning light\nThe gods had summon'd to the Olympian height:\nJove, first ascending from the watery bowers,\nLeads the long order of ethereal powers.\nWhen, like the morning-mist in early day,\nRose from the flood the daughter of the sea:\nAnd to the seats divine her flight address'd.\nThere, far apart, and high above the rest,\nThe thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds\nHis hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.\nSuppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed\nBeneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.\n\"If e'er, O father of the gods! (she said)\nMy words could please thee, or my actions aid,\nSome marks of honour on my son bestow,\nAnd pay in glory what in life you owe.\nFame is at least by heavenly promise due\nTo life so short, and now dishonour'd too.\nAvenge this wrong, O ever just and wise!\nLet Greece be humbled, and the Trojans rise;\nTill the proud king and all the Achaian race\nShall heap with honours him they now disgrace.\"\n[Illustration: ] THETIS ENTREATING JUPITER TO HONOUR ACHILLES\nThus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence held\nThe sacred counsels of his breast conceal'd.\nNot so repulsed, the goddess closer press'd,\nStill grasp'd his knees, and urged the dear request.\n\"O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;\nRefuse, or grant; for what has Jove to fear?\nOr oh! declare, of all the powers above,\nIs wretched Thetis least the care of Jove?\"\nShe said; and, sighing, thus the god replies,\nWho rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies:\n\"What hast thou ask'd? ah, why should Jove engage\nIn foreign contests and domestic rage,\nThe gods' complaints, and Juno's fierce alarms,\nWhile I, too partial, aid the Trojan arms?\nGo, lest the haughty partner of my sway\nWith jealous eyes thy close access survey;\nBut part in peace, secure thy prayer is sped:\nWitness the sacred honours of our head,\nThe nod that ratifies the will divine,\nThe faithful, fix'd, irrevocable sign;\nThis seals thy suit, and this fulfils thy vows\u2014\"\nHe spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,[70]\nShakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,\nThe stamp of fate and sanction of the god:\nHigh heaven with trembling the dread signal took,\nAnd all Olympus to the centre shook.[71]\nSwift to the seas profound the goddess flies,\nJove to his starry mansions in the skies.",

Is it thirst of gold?\nSay, shall we march with our unconquer'd powers\n(The Greeks and I) to Ilion's hostile towers,\nAnd bring the race of royal bastards here,\nFor Troy to ransom at a price too dear?\nBut safer plunder thy own host supplies;\nSay, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader's prize?\nOr, if thy heart to generous love be led,\nSome captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?\nWhate'er our master craves submit we must,\nPlagued with his pride, or punish'd for his lust.\nOh women of Achaia; men no more!\nHence let us fly, and let him waste his store\nIn loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.\nWe may be wanted on some busy day,\nWhen Hector comes: so great Achilles may:\nFrom him he forced the prize we jointly gave,\nFrom him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:\nAnd durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,\nThis mighty tyrant were no tyrant long.\"\nFierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,[87]\nIn generous vengeance of the king of kings.\nWith indignation sparkling in his eyes,\nHe views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:\n\"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,\nWith wrangling talents form'd for foul debate:\nCurb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,\nAnd singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.\nHave we not known thee, slave! of all our host,\nThe man who acts the least, upbraids the most?\nThink not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring,\nNor let those lips profane the name of king.\nFor our return we trust the heavenly powers;\nBe that their care; to fight like men be ours.\nBut grant the host with wealth the general load,\nExcept detraction, what hast thou bestow'd?\nSuppose some hero should his spoils resign,\nArt thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?\nGods! let me perish on this hateful shore,\nAnd let these eyes behold my son no more;\nIf, on thy next offence, this hand forbear\nTo strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,\nExpel the council where our princes meet,\nAnd send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.\"\nHe said, and cowering as the dastard bends,\nThe weighty sceptre on his back descends.[88]\nOn the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:\nThe tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;\nTrembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,\nFrom his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;\nWhile to his neighbour each express'd his thought:\n\"Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!\nWhat fruits his conduct and his courage yield!\nGreat in the council, glorious in the field.\nGenerous he rises in the crown's defence,\nTo curb the factious tongue of insolence,\nSuch just examples on offenders shown,\nSedition silence, and assert the throne.\"\n'Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,\nWho, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:\nThe blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,\n(In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.\nThe expecting crowds in still attention hung,\nTo hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.\nThen deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,\nHis silence thus the prudent hero broke:\n\"Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race\nWith shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.\nNot such at Argos was their generous vow:\nOnce all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:\nNe'er to return, was then the common cry,\nTill Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.\nBehold them weeping for their native shore;\nWhat could their wives or helpless children more?\nWhat heart but melts to leave the tender train,\nAnd, one short month, endure the wintry main?\nFew leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,\nWhen the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:\nThen well may this long stay provoke their tears,\nThe tedious length of nine revolving years.\nNot for their grief the Grecian host I blame;\nBut vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!\nExpect the time to Troy's destruction given.\nAnd try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.\nWhat pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,[89]\nAnd all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.\nBeside a fountain's sacred brink we raised\nOur verdant altars, and the victims blazed:\n'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,\nThe altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground\nA mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;\nFrom Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.\nStraight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,\nAnd curl'd around in many a winding fold;\nThe topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;\nEight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;\nHerself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,\nStretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;\nWhile hovering near, with miserable moan,\nThe drooping mother wail'd her children gone.\nThe mother last, as round the nest she flew,\nSeized by the beating wing, the monster slew;\nNor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands\nA lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.\nSuch was the will of Jove; and hence we dare\nTrust in his omen, and support the war.\nFor while around we gazed with wondering eyes,\nAnd trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,\nFull of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,[90]\n'Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.\nThis wondrous signal Jove himself displays,\nOf long, long labours, but eternal praise.\nAs many birds as by the snake were slain,\nSo many years the toils of Greece remain;\nBut wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'\nThus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.\nObey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,\nNor let your flight avert the Trojan fate.\"\nHe said: the shores with loud applauses sound,\nThe hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.\nThen Nestor thus\u2014\"These vain debates forbear,\nYe talk like children, not like heroes dare.\nWhere now are all your high resolves at last?\nYour leagues concluded, your engagements past?\nVow'd with libations and with victims then,\nNow vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!\nWhile useless words consume the unactive hours,\nNo wonder Troy so long resists our powers.\nRise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;\nWe march to war, if thou direct the way.\nBut leave the few that dare resist thy laws,\nThe mean deserters of the Grecian cause,\nTo grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,\nAnd view with envy our successful wars.\nOn that great day, when first the martial train,\nBig with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,\nJove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,\nAnd thunder rolling shook the firmament.\nEncouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,\nTill every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,\nTill Helen's woes at full revenged appear,\nAnd Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.\nBefore that day, if any Greek invite\nHis country's troops to base, inglorious flight,\nStand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,\nAnd die the dastard first, who dreads to die.\nBut now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:[91]\nNor what they offer, thou thyself despise.\nAmong those counsels, let not mine be vain;\nIn tribes and nations to divide thy train:\nHis separate troops let every leader call,\nEach strengthen each, and all encourage all.\nWhat chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,\nOr bravely fights, or ill obeys command,\nWhen thus distinct they war, shall soon be known\nAnd what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;\nIf fate resists, or if our arms are slow,\nIf gods above prevent, or men below.\"\nTo him the king: \"How much thy years excel\nIn arts of counsel, and in speaking well!\nO would the gods, in love to Greece, decree\nBut ten such sages as they grant in thee;\nSuch wisdom soon should Priam's force destroy,\nAnd soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!\nBut Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates\nIn fierce contention and in vain debates:\nNow great Achilles from our aid withdraws,\nBy me provoked; a captive maid the cause:\nIf e'er as friends we join, the Trojan wall\nMust shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!\nBut now, ye warriors, take a short repast;\nAnd, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.\nHis sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield,",

as when angry Jove\nHurls down the forky lightning from above,\nOn Arim\u00e9 when he the thunder throws,\nAnd fires Typh\u0153us with redoubled blows,\nWhere Typhon, press'd beneath the burning load,\nStill feels the fury of the avenging god.\nBut various Iris, Jove's commands to bear,\nSpeeds on the wings of winds through liquid air;\nIn Priam's porch the Trojan chiefs she found,\nThe old consulting, and the youths around.\nPolites' shape, the monarch's son, she chose,\nWho from \u00c6setes' tomb observed the foes,[105]\nHigh on the mound;

combat flows;\nWhile Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain\nOn either side, run purple to the main.\nGreat Ajax first to conquest led the way,\nBroke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day.\nThe Thracian Acamas his falchion found,\nAnd hew'd the enormous giant to the ground;\nHis thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd\nWhere the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest;\nFix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,\nAnd seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.\nNext Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,\nAxylus, hospitable, rich, and good:\nIn fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)[161]\nHe held his seat! a friend to human race.\nFast by the road, his ever-open door\nObliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.\nTo stern Tydides now he falls a prey,\nNo friend to guard him in the dreadful day!\nBreathless the good man fell, and by his side\nHis faithful servant, old Calesius died.\nBy great Euryalus was Dresus slain,\nAnd next he laid Opheltius on the plain.\nTwo twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,\nFrom a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:\n(Laomedon's white flocks Bucolion fed,\nThat monarch's first-born by a foreign bed;\nIn secret woods he won the naiad's grace,\nAnd two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace:)\nHere dead they lay in all their youthful charms;\nThe ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.\nAstyalus by Polyp\u0153tes fell;\nUlysses' spear Pidytes sent to hell;\nBy Teucer's shaft brave Aretaon bled,\nAnd Nestor's son laid stern Ablerus dead;\nGreat Agamemnon, leader of the brave,\nThe mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,\nWho held in Pedasus his proud abode,[162]\nAnd till'd the banks where silver Satnio flow'd.\nMelanthius by Eurypylus was slain;\nAnd Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.\nUnbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies\nBeneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.\nScared with the din and tumult of the fight,\nHis headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,\nRush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke\nThe shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke;\nWide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,\nFor Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.\nProne on his face he sinks beside the wheel:\nAtrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel;\nThe fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd\nThe victor's knees, and thus his prayer address'd:\n\"O spare my youth, and for the life I owe\nLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow.\nWhen fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,\nThy hollow ships his captive son detain:\nRich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,[163]\nAnd steel well-temper'd, and persuasive gold.\"\nHe said: compassion touch'd the hero's heart\nHe stood, suspended with the lifted dart:\nAs pity pleaded for his vanquish'd prize,\nStern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,\nAnd, furious, thus: \"Oh impotent of mind![164]\nShall these, shall these Atrides' mercy find?\nWell hast thou known proud Troy's perfidious land,\nAnd well her natives merit at thy hand!\nNot one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,\nShall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:\nIlion shall perish whole, and bury all;\nHer babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;[165]\nA dreadful lesson of exampled fate,\nTo warn the nations, and to curb the great!\"\nThe monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address'd,\nTo rigid justice steel'd his brother's breast.\nFierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;\nThe monarch's javelin stretch'd him in the dust,\nThen pressing with his foot his panting heart,\nForth from the slain he tugg'd the reeking dart.\nOld Nestor saw, and roused the warrior's rage;\n\"Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;\nNo son of Mars descend, for servile gains,\nTo touch the booty, while a foe remains.\nBehold yon glittering host, your future spoil!\nFirst gain the conquest, then reward the toil.\"\nAnd now had Greece eternal fame acquired,\nAnd frighted Troy within her walls, retired,\nHad not sage Helenus her state redress'd,\nTaught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.\nWhere Hector stood, with great \u00c6neas join'd,\nThe seer reveal'd the counsels of his mind:\n\"Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay\nThe cares and glories of this doubtful day;\nOn whom your aids, your country's hopes depend;\nWise to consult, and active to defend!\nHere, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,\nTurn back the routed, and forbid the flight,\nEre yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain,\nThe sport and insult of the hostile train.\nWhen your commands have hearten'd every band,\nOurselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand;\nPress'd as we are, and sore of former fight,\nThese straits demand our last remains of might.\nMeanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,\nAnd teach our mother what the gods require:\nDirect the queen to lead the assembled train\nOf Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;[166]\nUnbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,\nWith offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.\nThe largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,\nMost prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\nBefore the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altars led:\nIf so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare,\nAnd far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\nThat mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;\nNot thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,\nSprung though he was from more than mortal bed;\nNot thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,\nIn rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might.\"\nHector obedient heard: and, with a bound,\nLeap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;\nThrough all his host inspiring force he flies,\nAnd bids the thunder of the battle rise.\nWith rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,\nAnd turn the tide of conflict on the foe:\nFierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;\nAll Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;\nSome god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,\nShot down avenging from the vault of stars.\nThen thus aloud: \"Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!\nAnd you whom distant nations send to war!\nBe mindful of the strength your fathers bore;\nBe still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.\nOne hour demands me in the Trojan wall,\nTo bid our altars flame, and victims fall:\nNor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,\nAnd reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.\"\nThis said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;\nThe shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,\nHis neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;\nAnd as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.\nNow paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),[167]\nWhere daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son\nBetween both armies met: the chiefs from far\nObserved each other, and had mark'd for war.\nNear as they drew, Tydides thus began:\n\"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?\nOur eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,\nWhere fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;\nYet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,\nAnd meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.\nUnhappy they, and born of luckless sires,\nWho tempt our fury when Minerva fires!\nBut if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,\nKnow with immortals we no more contend.\nNot long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,\nThat daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.\nBacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,\nWith brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:\nTheir consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,\nWith curling vines and twisted ivy bound;\nWhile Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,\nAnd Thetis' arms received the trembling god.\nNor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;\n(The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)\nDeprived of sight by their avenging doom,\nCheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,\nThen sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,\nA wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!\nI brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth\nSustain thy life, and human be thy birth,\nBold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,\nApproach, and enter the dark gates of death.\"\n\"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,\n(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?\nLike leaves on trees the race of man is found,\nNow green in youth, now withering on the ground;\nAnother race the following spring supplies;\nThey fall successive, and successive rise:\nSo generations in their course decay;\nSo flourish these, when those are pass'd away.\nBut if thou still persist to search my birth,\nThen hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.\n\"A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,\n(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)\n\u00c6olian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,\nIn ancient time the happy wall possess'd,\nThen call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;\nGreat Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,\nWho o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,\nLoved for that valour which preserves mankind.\nThen mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,\nWhose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.\nWith direful jealousy the monarch raged,\nAnd the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.\nFor him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,\nAnd strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:\nIn vain she tempted the relentless youth,\nEndued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.\nFired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,\nAnd begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:\nIncensed he heard, resolving on his fate;\nBut hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:\nTo Lycia the devoted youth he sent,\nWith tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.[168]\nNow bless'd by every power who guards the good,\nThe chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:\nThere Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,\nNine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.\nBut when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,\nThe faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:\nThe fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,\nThe deathful secret to the king reveal'd.\nFirst, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;\nA mingled monster of no mortal kind!\nBehind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;\nA goat's rough body bore a lion's head;\nHer pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;\nHer gaping throat emits infernal fire.\n\"This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,\nAnd trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)\nThen met in arms the Solym\u00e6an crew,[169]\n(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;\nNext the bold Amazons' whole force defied;\nAnd conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.\n\"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,\nAt his return, a treacherous ambush rose,\nWith levell'd spears along the winding shore:\nThere fell they breathless, and return'd no more.\n\"At length the monarch, with repentant grief,\nConfess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;\nHis daughter gave, the stranger to detain,\nWith half the honours of his ample reign:\nThe Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,\nWith woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.\nThere long the chief his happy lot possess'd,\nWith two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;\n(Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love\nCrown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)\nBut when at last, distracted in his mind,\nForsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,\nWide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,\nA long, forlorn, uncomfortable way![170]\nWoes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:\nHis beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;\nHis eldest born by raging Mars was slain,\nIn combat on the Solymaean plain.\nHippolochus survived: from him I came,\nThe honour'd author of my birth and name;\nBy his decree I sought the Trojan town;\nBy his instructions learn to win renown,\nTo stand the first in worth as in command,\nTo add new honours to my native land,\nBefore my eyes my mighty sires to place,\nAnd emulate the glories of our race.\"\nHe spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;\nIn earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,\nThen friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:\n\"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!\nThus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,\nNor stain the sacred friendship of our race.\nKnow, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;\n\u0152neus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:\nOur ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,\nWhere twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.\nThe parting heroes mutual presents left;\nA golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;\n\u0152neus a belt of matchless work bestowed,\nThat rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.\n(This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored\nAmong my treasures, still adorns my board:\nFor Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall\nBeheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)\nMindful of this, in friendship let us join;\nIf heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,\nMy guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.\nEnough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,\nIn the full harvest of yon ample field;\nEnough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;\nBut thou and Diomed be foes no more.\nNow change we arms, and prove to either host\nWe guard the friendship of the line we boast.\"\nThus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,\nTheir hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;\nBrave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,\n(Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)\nFor Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,\nFor which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)\nHe gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,[171]\nA hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.\nMeantime the guardian of the Trojan state,\nGreat Hector, enter'd at the Sc\u00e6an gate.[172]\nBeneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,\nThe Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids\nAround him flock'd, all press'd with pious care\nFor husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.\nHe bids the train in long procession go,\nAnd seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.\nAnd now to Priam's stately courts he came,\nRais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;\nO'er these a range of marble structure runs,\nThe rich pavilions of his fifty sons,\nIn fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,[173]\nOpposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.\nTwelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,\nOf equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.\nHither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen\nOf royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.\n(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face\nSurpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)\nLong in a strict embrace she held her son,\nAnd press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:\n\"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls\nMy son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;\nCom'st thou to supplicate the almighty power\nWith lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?\nStay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,\nIn Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,\nAnd pay due vows to all the gods around.\nThen with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,\nAnd draw new spirits from the generous bowl;\nSpent as thou art with long laborious fight,\nThe brave defender of thy country's right.\"\n\"Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)\nInflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,\nUnnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.\nLet chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice\nTo sprinkle to the gods, its better use.\nBy me that holy office were profaned;\nIll fits it me, with human gore distain'd,\nTo the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,\nOr offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.\nYou, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,\nAnd burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.\nThe largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,\nMost prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\nBefore the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altar led.\nSo may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare;\nAnd far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\nWho mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.\nBe this, O mother, your religious care:\nI go to rouse soft Paris to the war;\nIf yet not lost to all the sense of shame,",

When the\nfunerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,\nerect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with\ntowers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his\njealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both\narmies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans\nwith thunder, and other signs of his wrath.\nThe three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax,\nthe next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the\nfuneral rites of the slain and one more in building the\nfortification before the ships. So that somewhat about three days\nis employed in this book. The scene lies wholly in the field.",

On either hand\nThe squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;\nGreat Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:\nThey breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.\nThe Athenian maid,[178] and glorious god of day,\nWith silent joy the settling hosts survey:\nIn form of vultures, on the beech's height\nThey sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.\nThe thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,\nHorrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.\nAs when a general darkness veils the main,\n(Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,)\nThe waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,\nAnd a still horror saddens all the deeps;\nThus in thick orders settling wide around,\nAt length composed they sit, and shade the ground.\nGreat Hector first amidst both armies broke\nThe solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:\n\"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,\nWhat my soul prompts, and what some god commands.\nGreat Jove, averse our warfare to compose,\nO'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;\nWar with a fiercer tide once more returns,\nTill Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.\nYou then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;\n'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:\nFrom all your troops select the boldest knight,\nAnd him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.\nHere if I fall, by chance of battle slain,\nBe his my spoil, and his these arms remain;\nBut let my body, to my friends return'd,\nBy Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn'd.\nAnd if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,\nShall stretch your daring champion in the dust;\nIf mine the glory to despoil the foe;\nOn Ph\u0153bus' temple I'll his arms bestow:\nThe breathless carcase to your navy sent,\nGreece on the shore shall raise a monument;\nWhich when some future mariner surveys,\nWash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,\nThus shall he say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,\nBy Hector slain, the mighty man of war,'\nThe stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name\nAnd distant ages learn the victor's fame.\"\nThis fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,\nBlush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.\nStern Menelaus first the silence broke,\nAnd, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:\n\"Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,\nWhose coward souls your manly form disgrace,\nHow great the shame, when every age shall know\nThat not a Grecian met this noble foe!\nGo then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,\nA heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!\nBe what ye seem, unanimated clay,\nMyself will dare the danger of the day;\n'Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,\nBut in the hands of God is victory.\"\nThese words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,\nHis manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.\nThat day, Atrides! a superior hand\nHad stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;\nBut all at once, thy fury to compose,\nThe kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;\nEven he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd\nThy daring hand, and this advice address'd:\n\"Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,\nAnd tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?\nGrieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;\nGreat Hector's arm is mightier far than thine:\nEven fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,\nAnd trembling met this dreadful son of war.\nSit thou secure, amidst thy social band;\nGreece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.\nThe mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,\nThough bold and burning with desire of fame,\nContent the doubtful honour might forego,\nSo great the danger, and so brave the foe.\"\nHe said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;\nHe stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,\nNo longer bent to rush on certain harms;\nHis joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.\nHe from whose lips divine persuasion flows,\nGrave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;\nThus to the kings he spoke: \"What grief, what shame\nAttend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!\nHow shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn\nTheir sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!\nWhat tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,\nO Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!\nOnce with what joy the generous prince would hear\nOf every chief who fought this glorious war,\nParticipate their fame, and pleased inquire\nEach name, each action, and each hero's sire!\nGods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,\nAnd trembling all before one hostile hand;\nHow would he lift his aged arms on high,\nLament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!\nOh! would to all the immortal powers above,\nMinerva, Ph\u0153bus, and almighty Jove!\nYears might again roll back, my youth renew,\nAnd give this arm the spring which once it knew\nWhen fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,\nI led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,\nAnd with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,\nWhere Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.[179]\nThere Ereuthalion braved us in the field,\nProud Areithous' dreadful arms to wield;\nGreat Areithous, known from shore to shore\nBy the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;\nNo lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,\nBut broke, with this, the battle of the foe.\nHim not by manly force Lycurgus slew,\nWhose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,\nDeep in a winding way his breast assailed,\nNor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.\nSupine he fell: those arms which Mars before\nHad given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:\nBut when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,\nTo Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.\nFurious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,\nAnd dared the trial of the strongest hands;\nNor could the strongest hands his fury stay:\nAll saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway\nTill I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,\nAnd, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.\nI fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd:\nProne fell the giant o'er a length of ground.\nWhat then I was, O were your Nestor now!\nNot Hector's self should want an equal foe.\nBut, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,\nThe flower of Greece, the examples of our host,\nSprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,\nCan you stand trembling, and desert the day?\"\nHis warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;\nAnd nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,\nUp-started fierce: but far before the rest\nThe king of men advanced his dauntless breast:\nThen bold Tydides, great in arms, appear'd;\nAnd next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear'd;\nO\u00efleus follow'd; Idomen was there,[180]\nAnd Merion, dreadful as the god of war:\nWith these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,\nAnd wise Ulysses closed the daring band.\nAll these, alike inspired with noble rage,\nDemand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:\n\"Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,\nWhat chief shall combat, let the gods decide.\nWhom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise\nHis country's fame, his own immortal praise.\"\nThe lots produced, each hero signs his own:\nThen in the general's helm the fates are thrown,[181]\nThe people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,\nAnd vows like these ascend from all the bands:\n\"Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,\nA worthy champion for the Grecian state:\nThis task let Ajax or Tydides prove,\nOr he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove.\"\nOld Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,\nLeap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.\nThis from the right to left the herald bears,\nHeld out in order to the Grecian peers;\nEach to his rival yields the mark unknown,\nTill godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;\nSurveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,\nThen casts before him, and with transport cries:\n\"Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;\nBe mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.\nNow while my brightest arms my limbs invest,\nTo Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:\nBut pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,\nAnd deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.\nSaid I in secret? No, your vows declare\nIn such a voice as fills the earth and air,\nLives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?\nAjax, in all the toils of battle bred!\nFrom warlike Salamis I drew my birth,\nAnd, born to combats, fear no force on earth.\"\nHe said. The troops with elevated eyes,\nImplore the god whose thunder rends the skies:\n\"O father of mankind, superior lord!\nOn lofty Ida's holy hill adored:\nWho in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,\nSupreme of gods! unbounded and alone:\nGrant thou, that Telamon may bear away\nThe praise and conquest of this doubtful day;\nOr, if illustrious Hector be thy care,\nThat both may claim it, and that both may share.\"\nNow Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;\nSheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:\nHe moves to combat with majestic pace;\nSo stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,[182]\nWhen Jove to punish faithless men prepares,\nAnd gives whole nations to the waste of wars,\nThus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;\nGrimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:[183]\nHis massy javelin quivering in his hand,\nHe stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.\nThrough every Argive heart new transport ran;\nAll Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:\nEven Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,\nFelt his great heart suspended in his breast:\n'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;\nHimself had challenged, and the foe drew near.\nStern Telamon behind his ample shield,\nAs from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.\nHuge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,\nOf tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,\n(The work of Tychius, who in Hyl\u00e8 dwell'd\nAnd in all arts of armoury excell'd,)\nThis Ajax bore before his manly breast,\nAnd, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:\n\"Hector! approach my arm, and singly know\nWhat strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.\nAchilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,\nNot void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:\nLet him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,\nIndulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;\nWhole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,\nAnd sends thee one, a sample of her host,\nSuch as I am, I come to prove thy might;\nNo more\u2014be sudden, and begin the fight.\"\n\"O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!\n(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)\nMe, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,\nNew to the field, and trembling at the fight?\nThou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,\nTo combat born, and bred amidst alarms:\nI know to shift my ground, remount the car,\nTurn, charge, and answer every call of war;\nTo right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,\nAnd bear thick battle on my sounding shield/\nBut open be our fight, and bold each blow;\nI steal no conquest from a noble foe.\"\nHe said, and rising, high above the field\nWhirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.\nFull on the brass descending from above\nThrough six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,\nTill in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;\nThrough Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,\nHis corslet enters, and his garment rends,\nAnd glancing downwards, near his flank descends.\nThe wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low\nBeneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.\nFrom their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,\nThen close impetuous, and the charge renew;\nFierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,\nOr foaming boars, the terror of the wood.\nAt Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;\nThe blunted point against the buckler bends;\nBut Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,\nDrove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;\nIt reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!\nSpouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.\nYet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,\nIn his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,\nBlack, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;\nFull on the brazen boss the stone descends;\nThe hollow brass resounded with the shock:\nThen Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,\nApplied each nerve, and swinging round on high,\nWith force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;\nThe huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:\nHis slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;\nGreat Hector falls extended on the field,\nHis bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:\nNor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might\nConfirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.\nAnd now both heroes their broad falchions drew\nIn flaming circles round their heads they flew;\nBut then by heralds' voice the word was given.\nThe sacred ministers of earth and heaven:\nDivine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,\nAnd sage Id\u00e6us on the part of Troy,\nBetween the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;\nAnd first Id\u00e6us' awful voice was heard:\n[Illustration: ] HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS\n\"Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,\nBoth dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.\nTo either host your matchless worth is known,\nEach sounds your praise, and war is all your own.\nBut now the Night extends her awful shade;\nThe goddess parts you; be the night obey'd.\"[184]\nTo whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:\n\"O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.\nLet him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,\nLet him demand the sanction of the night;\nIf first he ask'd it, I content obey,\nAnd cease the strife when Hector shows the way.\"\n\"O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin'd)\nWhom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,\nWith strength of body, and with worth of mind!\nNow martial law commands us to forbear;\nHereafter we shall meet in glorious war,\nSome future day shall lengthen out the strife,\nAnd let the gods decide of death or life!\nSince, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,\nAnd heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.\nReturn, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,\nAnd joy the nations whom thy arm defends;\nAs I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,\nWho wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.\nBut let us, on this memorable day,\nExchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,\n'Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;\nAnd each brave foe was in his soul a friend.'\"\nWith that, a sword with stars of silver graced,\nThe baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,\nHe gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow'd\nA radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.\nThen with majestic grace they quit the plain;\nThis seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.\nThe Trojan bands returning Hector wait,\nAnd hail with joy the Champion of their state;\nEscaped great Ajax, they survey him round,",

Then Ph\u0153nix rose;\n(Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows;)\nAnd while the fate of suffering Greece he mourn'd,\nWith accent weak these tender words return'd.\n[Illustration: ] PROSERPINE\n\"Divine Achilles! wilt thou then retire,\nAnd leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?\nIf wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,\nHow shall thy friend, thy Ph\u0153nix, stay behind?\nThe royal Peleus, when from Pythia's coast\nHe sent thee early to the Achaian host;\nThy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd,\nAnd new to perils of the direful field:\nHe bade me teach thee all the ways of war,\nTo shine in councils, and in camps to dare.\nNever, ah, never let me leave thy side!\nNo time shall part us, and no fate divide,\nNot though the god, that breathed my life, restore\nThe bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,\nWhen Greece of old beheld my youthful flames\n(Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames),\nMy father faithless to my mother's arms,\nOld as he was, adored a stranger's charms.\nI tried what youth could do (at her desire)\nTo win the damsel, and prevent my sire.\nMy sire with curses loads my hated head,\nAnd cries, 'Ye furies! barren be his bed.'\nInfernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below,\nAnd ruthless Proserpine, confirm'd his vow.\nDespair and grief distract my labouring mind!\nGods! what a crime my impious heart design'd!\nI thought (but some kind god that thought suppress'd)\nTo plunge the poniard in my father's breast;\nThen meditate my flight: my friends in vain\nWith prayers entreat me, and with force detain.\nOn fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,\nThey daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;\nStrong guards they placed, and watch'd nine nights entire;\nThe roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.\nThe tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all:\nAnd, favour'd by the night, o'erleap'd the wall,\nMy travels thence through spacious Greece extend;\nIn Phthia's court at last my labours end.\nYour sire received me, as his son caress'd,\nWith gifts enrich'd, and with possessions bless'd.\nThe strong Dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign,\nAnd all the coast that runs along the main.\nBy love to thee his bounties I repaid,\nAnd early wisdom to thy soul convey'd:\nGreat as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:\nA child I took thee, but a hero gave.\nThy infant breast a like affection show'd;\nStill in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)\nOr at my knee, by Ph\u0153nix wouldst thou stand;\nNo food was grateful but from Ph\u0153nix' hand.[211]\nI pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years,\nThe tender labours, the compliant cares,\nThe gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree,\nAnd Ph\u0153nix felt a father's joys in thee:\nThy growing virtues justified my cares,\nAnd promised comfort to my silver hairs.\nNow be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd;\nA cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:\nThe gods (the only great, and only wise)\nAre moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;\nOffending man their high compassion wins,\nAnd daily prayers atone for daily sins.\nPrayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race,\nLame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;\nWith humble mien, and with dejected eyes,\nConstant they follow, where injustice flies.\nInjustice swift, erect, and unconfined,\nSweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind,\nWhile Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.\nWho hears these daughters of almighty Jove,\nFor him they mediate to the throne above:\nWhen man rejects the humble suit they make,\nThe sire revenges for the daughters' sake;\nFrom Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then\nDescends to punish unrelenting men.\nO let not headlong passion bear the sway\nThese reconciling goddesses obey:\nDue honours to the seed of Jove belong,\nDue honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.\nWere these not paid thee by the terms we bring,\nWere rage still harbour'd in the haughty king;\nNor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage\nThy friend to plead against so just a rage.\nBut since what honour asks the general sends,\nAnd sends by those whom most thy heart commends;\nThe best and noblest of the Grecian train;\nPermit not these to sue, and sue in vain!\nLet me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,\nA great example drawn from times of old;\nHear what our fathers were, and what their praise,\nWho conquer'd their revenge in former days.\n\"Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands[212]\nOnce fought the \u00c6tolian and Curetian bands;\nTo guard it those; to conquer, these advance;\nAnd mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.\nThe silver Cynthia bade contention rise,\nIn vengeance of neglected sacrifice;\nOn \u0152neus fields she sent a monstrous boar,\nThat levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore:\nThis beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)\nGreat Meleager stretch'd along the plain,\nThen, for his spoils, a new debate arose,\nThe neighbour nations thence commencing foes.\nStrong as they were, the bold Curetes fail'd,\nWhile Meleager's thundering arm prevail'd:\nTill rage at length inflamed his lofty breast\n(For rage invades the wisest and the best).\n\"Cursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,\nAnd in his wife's embrace forgets the fields.\n(She from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair,\nAnd matchless Idas, more than man in war:\nThe god of day adored the mother's charms;\nAgainst the god the father bent his arms:\nThe afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,\nFrom Cleopatra changed their daughter's name,\nAnd call'd Alcyone; a name to show\nThe father's grief, the mourning mother's woe.)\nTo her the chief retired from stern debate,\nBut found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate:\nAlthaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,\nWhose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;\nShe beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath\nOn her own son to wreak her brother's death;\nHell heard her curses from the realms profound,\nAnd the red fiends that walk the nightly round.\nIn vain \u00c6tolia her deliverer waits,\nWar shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.\nShe sent ambassadors, a chosen band,\nPriests of the gods, and elders of the land;\nBesought the chief to save the sinking state:\nTheir prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:\n(Full fifty acres of the richest ground,\nHalf pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd:)\nHis suppliant father, aged \u0152neus, came;\nHis sisters follow'd; even the vengeful dame,\nAlthaea, sues; his friends before him fall:\nHe stands relentless, and rejects them all.\nMeanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies;\nThe walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;\nAt length his wife (a form divine) appears,\nWith piercing cries, and supplicating tears;\nShe paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,\nThe heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,\nThe matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved:\nThe warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.\nThe \u00c6tolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,\nAnd left the chief their broken faith to mourn.\nLearn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,\nNor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;\nAccept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;\nAnd be amongst our guardian gods adored.\"\nThus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:\n\"My second father, and my reverend guide:\nThy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,\nAnd asks no honours from a mortal's hands;\nJove honours me, and favours my designs;\nHis pleasure guides me, and his will confines;\nAnd here I stay (if such his high behest)\nWhile life's warm spirit beats within my breast.\nYet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:\nNo more molest me on Atrides' part:\nIs it for him these tears are taught to flow,\nFor him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?\nA generous friendship no cold medium knows,\nBurns with one love, with one resentment glows;\nOne should our interests and our passions be;\nMy friend must hate the man that injures me.\nDo this, my Ph\u0153nix, 'tis a generous part;\nAnd share my realms, my honours, and my heart.\nLet these return: our voyage, or our stay,\nRest undetermined till the dawning day.\"\nHe ceased; then order'd for the sage's bed\nA warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.\nWith that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,\nAnd thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:\n\"Hence let us go\u2014why waste we time in vain?\nSee what effect our low submissions gain!\nLiked or not liked, his words we must relate,\nThe Greeks expect them, and our heroes wait.\nProud as he is, that iron heart retains\nIts stubborn purpose, and his friends disdains.\nStern and unpitying! if a brother bleed,\nOn just atonement, we remit the deed;\nA sire the slaughter of his son forgives;\nThe price of blood discharged, the murderer lives:\nThe haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,\nAnd gifts can conquer every soul but thine.[213]\nThe gods that unrelenting breast have steel'd,\nAnd cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.\nOne woman-slave was ravish'd from thy arms:\nLo, seven are offer'd, and of equal charms.\nThen hear, Achilles! be of better mind;\nRevere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;\nAnd know the men of all the Grecian host,\nWho honour worth, and prize thy valour most.\"\n\"O soul of battles, and thy people's guide!\n(To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)\nWell hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant's name\nMy rage rekindles, and my soul's on flame:\n'Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:\nDisgraced, dishonour'd, like the vilest slave!\nReturn, then, heroes! and our answer bear,\nThe glorious combat is no more my care;\nNot till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,\nThe blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;\nNot till the flames, by Hector's fury thrown,\nConsume your vessels, and approach my own;\nJust there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,\nThere cease his battle, and there feel our hand.\"\nThis said, each prince a double goblet crown'd,\nAnd cast a large libation on the ground;\nThen to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,\nThe chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.\nMeantime Achilles' slaves prepared a bed,\nWith fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:\nThere, till the sacred morn restored the day,\nIn slumber sweet the reverend Ph\u0153nix lay.\nBut in his inner tent, an ampler space,\nAchilles slept; and in his warm embrace\nFair Diomede of the Lesbian race.\nLast, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,\nWhose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;\nAchilles to his friend consign'd her charms\nWhen Scyros fell before his conquering arms.\nAnd now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,\nPass'd through the hosts, and reach'd the royal tent.\nThen rising all, with goblets in their hands,\nThe peers and leaders of the Achaian bands\nHail'd their return: Atrides first begun:\n\"Say what success? divine Laertes' son!\nAchilles' high resolves declare to all:\nReturns the chief, or must our navy fall?\"\n\"Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)\nFix'd is his wrath, unconquer'd is his pride;\nHe slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,\nAnd, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.\nTo save our army, and our fleets to free,\nIs not his care; but left to Greece and thee.\nYour eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,\nBeneath his oars the whitening billows fly;\nUs too he bids our oars and sails employ,\nNor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;\nFor Jove o'ershades her with his arm divine,\nInspires her war, and bids her glory shine.\nSuch was his word: what further he declared,\nThese sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.\nBut Ph\u0153nix in his tent the chief retains,\nSafe to transport him to his native plains\nWhen morning dawns; if other he decree,\nHis age is sacred, and his choice is free.\"",

the Spartan thus begun:\n\"Why puts my brother his bright armour on?\nSends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,\nTo try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?\nBut say, what hero shall sustain that task?\nSuch bold exploits uncommon courage ask;\nGuideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,\nAnd midst a hostile camp explore the foe.\"\nTo whom the king: \"In such distress we stand,\nNo vulgar counsel our affairs demand;\nGreece to preserve, is now no easy part,\nBut asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.\nFor Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,\nAnd bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.\nWhat eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,\nIn one great day, by one great arm achieved,\nSuch wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,\nAnd we beheld, the last revolving sun?\nWhat honours the beloved of Jove adorn!\nSprung from no god, and of no goddess born;\nYet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,\nAnd curse the battle where their fathers fell.\n\"Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,\nThere call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;\nOurself to hoary Nestor will repair;\nTo keep the guards on duty be his care,\n(For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,\nWhose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.\")\nTo whom the Spartan: \"These thy orders borne,\nSay, shall I stay, or with despatch return?\"\n\"There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)\nElse may we miss to meet, without a guide,\nThe paths so many, and the camp so wide.\nStill, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,\nUrge by their fathers' fame their future praise.\nForget we now our state and lofty birth;\nNot titles here, but works, must prove our worth.\nTo labour is the lot of man below;\nAnd when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe.\"\nThis said, each parted to his several cares:\nThe king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;\nThe sage protector of the Greeks he found\nStretch'd in his bed with all his arms around;\nThe various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,\nThe shining helmet, and the pointed spears;\nThe dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,\nThat, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.\nThen, leaning on his hand his watchful head,\nThe hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:\n\"What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,\nWhile others sleep, thus range the camp alone;\nSeek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?\nStand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell.\"\n\"O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)\nPride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!\nLo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,\nThe unhappy general of the Grecian bands,\nWhom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,\nAnd woes, that only with his life shall end!\nScarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,\nAnd scarce my heart support its load of pain.\nNo taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,\nConfused, and sad, I wander thus alone,\nWith fears distracted, with no fix'd design;\nAnd all my people's miseries are mine.\nIf aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,\n(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)\nImpart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;\nNow let us jointly to the trench descend,\nAt every gate the fainting guard excite,\nTired with the toils of day and watch of night;\nElse may the sudden foe our works invade,\nSo near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade.\"\nTo him thus Nestor: \"Trust the powers above,\nNor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:\nHow ill agree the views of vain mankind,\nAnd the wise counsels of the eternal mind!\nAudacious Hector, if the gods ordain\nThat great Achilles rise and rage again,\nWhat toils attend thee, and what woes remain!\nLo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;\nThe care is next our other chiefs to raise:\nUlysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;\nMeges for strength, O\u00efleus famed for speed.\nSome other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,\nTo those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,\nWhere lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.[216]\nTo rouse the Spartan I myself decree;\nDear as he is to us, and dear to thee,\nYet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share\nWith his great brother in his martial care:\nHim it behoved to every chief to sue,\nPreventing every part perform'd by you;\nFor strong necessity our toils demands,\nClaims all our hearts, and urges all our hands.\"\nTo whom the king: \"With reverence we allow\nThy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:\nMy generous brother is of gentle kind,\nHe seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;\nThrough too much deference to our sovereign sway,\nContent to follow when we lead the way:\nBut now, our ills industrious to prevent,\nLong ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.\nThe chiefs you named, already at his call,\nPrepare to meet us near the navy-wall;\nAssembling there, between the trench and gates,\nNear the night-guards, our chosen council waits.\"",

Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is\ncommanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the\nengagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field.\nHe then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a\nstop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is\nobliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans,\nwounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him.\nHector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and\nrallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the\narmy, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in\nNestor's chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)\nsent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that\nmanner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the\naccidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he\nremembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight\nfor his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in\nAchilles' armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also\nwounded, and assists him in that distress.\nThis book opens with the eight-and-twentieth day of the poem, and\nthe same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended\nthrough the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth,\nseventeenth, and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in\nthe field near the monument of Ilus.",

light:\nWhen baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command,\nThe torch of discord blazing in her hand,\nThrough the red skies her bloody sign extends,\nAnd, wrapt in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.\nHigh on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand\nShe took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.\nEven Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,\nWhose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,\nThence the black fury through the Grecian throng\nWith horror sounds the loud Orthian song:\nThe navy shakes, and at the dire alarms\nEach bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.\nNo more they sigh, inglorious to return,\nBut breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.\n[Illustration: ] THE DESCENT OF DISCORD\nThe king of men his hardy host inspires\nWith loud command, with great example fires!\nHimself first rose, himself before the rest\nHis mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd,\nAnd first he cased his manly legs around\nIn shining greaves with silver buckles bound;\nThe beaming cuirass next adorn'd his breast,\nThe same which once king Cinyras possess'd:\n(The fame of Greece and her assembled host\nHad reach'd that monarch on the Cyprian coast;\n'Twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,\nThis glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)\nTen rows of azure steel the work infold,\nTwice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;\nThree glittering dragons to the gorget rise,\nWhose imitated scales against the skies\nReflected various light, and arching bow'd,\nLike colour'd rainbows o'er a showery cloud\n(Jove's wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,\nPlaced as a sign to man amidst the skies).\nA radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,\nSustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:\nGold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased\nThe shining blade, and golden hangers graced.\nHis buckler's mighty orb was next display'd,\nThat round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;\nTen zones of brass its ample brim surround,\nAnd twice ten bosses the bright convex crown'd:\nTremendous Gorgon frown'd upon its field,\nAnd circling terrors fill'd the expressive shield:\nWithin its concave hung a silver thong,\nOn which a mimic serpent creeps along,\nHis azure length in easy waves extends,\nTill in three heads the embroider'd monster ends.\nLast o'er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,\nWith nodding horse-hair formidably graced;\nAnd in his hands two steely javelins wields,\nThat blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.\nThat instant Juno, and the martial maid,\nIn happy thunders promised Greece their aid;\nHigh o'er the chief they clash'd their arms in air,\nAnd, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.\nClose to the limits of the trench and mound,\nThe fiery coursers to their chariots bound\nThe squires restrain'd: the foot, with those who wield\nThe lighter arms, rush forward to the field.\nTo second these, in close array combined,\nThe squadrons spread their sable wings behind.\nNow shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,\nAs with the light the warriors' toils begun.\nEven Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd\nRed drops of blood o'er all the fatal field;[220]\nThe woes of men unwilling to survey,\nAnd all the slaughters that must stain the day.\nNear Ilus' tomb, in order ranged around,\nThe Trojan lines possess'd the rising ground:\nThere wise Polydamas and Hector stood;\n\u00c6neas, honour'd as a guardian god;\nBold Polybus, Agenor the divine;\nThe brother-warriors of Antenor's line:\nWith youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face\nAnd fair proportion match'd the ethereal race.\nGreat Hector, cover'd with his spacious shield,\nPlies all the troops, and orders all the field.\nAs the red star now shows his sanguine fires\nThrough the dark clouds, and now in night retires,\nThus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,\nPlunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;\nWhile streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,\nFlash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.\nAs sweating reapers in some wealthy field,\nRanged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,\nBear down the furrows, till their labours meet;\nThick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:\nSo Greece and Troy the field of war divide,\nAnd falling ranks are strow'd on every side.\nNone stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight;[221]\nBut horse to horse, and man to man they fight,\nNot rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;\nEach wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.\nDiscord with joy the scene of death descries,\nAnd drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:\nDiscord alone, of all the immortal train,\nSwells the red horrors of this direful plain:\nThe gods in peace their golden mansions fill,\nRanged in bright order on the Olympian hill:\nBut general murmurs told their griefs above,\nAnd each accused the partial will of Jove.\nMeanwhile apart, superior, and alone,\nThe eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,\nWrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;\nAnd fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate.\nOn earth he turn'd his all-considering eyes,\nAnd mark'd the spot where Ilion's towers arise;\nThe sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,\nThe victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.\nThus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,\nO'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light,\nCommutual death the fate of war confounds,\nEach adverse battle gored with equal wounds.",

and sues his seed for grace?\nNo, die, and pay the forfeit of your race.\"\nThis said, Pisander from the car he cast,\nAnd pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.\nHis brother leap'd to earth; but, as he lay,\nThe trenchant falchion lopp'd his hands away;\nHis sever'd head was toss'd among the throng,\nAnd, rolling, drew a bloody train along.\nThen, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;\nThe king's example all his Greeks pursue.\nNow by the foot the flying foot were slain,\nHorse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.\nFrom the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,\nShade the black host, and intercept the skies.\nThe brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,\nAnd the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,\nStill slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;\nThe distanced army wonders at his deeds,\nAs when the winds with raging flames conspire,\nAnd o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,\nIn blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall,\nAnd one refulgent ruin levels all:\nBefore Atrides' rage so sinks the foe,\nWhole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.\nThe steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,\nAnd many a car, now lighted of its lord,\nWide o'er the field with guideless fury rolls,\nBreaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;\nWhile his keen falchion drinks the warriors' lives;\nMore grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!\nPerhaps great Hector then had found his fate,\nBut Jove and destiny prolong'd his date.\nSafe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,\nAmidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.\nNow past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,\nThrough the mid field the routed urge their way:\nWhere the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,\nThe path they take, and speed to reach the town.\nAs swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,\nHot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.\nNow near the beech-tree, and the Sc\u00e6an gates,\nThe hero halts, and his associates waits.\nMeanwhile on every side around the plain,\nDispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.\nSo flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd\nThe lion's roaring through the midnight shade;\nOn heaps they tumble with successless haste;\nThe savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.\nNot with less fury stern Atrides flew,\nStill press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;\nHurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,\nAnd rage, and death, and carnage load the field.\nNow storms the victor at the Trojan wall;\nSurveys the towers, and meditates their fall.\nBut Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,\nAnd down their summits pour'd a hundred rills:\nThe unkindled lightning in his hand he took,\nAnd thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:\n\"Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,\nTo godlike Hector this our word convey\u2014\nWhile Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\nFights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\nBid him give way; but issue forth commands,\nAnd trust the war to less important hands:\nBut when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\nThat chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\nThen Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,\nThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,\nTill to the main the burning sun descend,\nAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.\"\nHe spoke, and Iris at his word obey'd;\nOn wings of winds descends the various maid.\nThe chief she found amidst the ranks of war,\nClose to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.\nThe goddess then: \"O son of Priam, hear!\nFrom Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.\nWhile Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,\nFights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,\nAbstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,\nAnd trust the war to less important hands:\nBut when, or wounded by the spear or dart,\nThe chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,\nThen Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,\nThen to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,\nTill to the main the burning sun descend,\nAnd sacred night her awful shade extend.\"\nShe said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound,\nSprings from his chariot on the trembling ground,\nIn clanging arms: he grasps in either hand\nA pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;\nRevives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,\nAnd wakes anew the dying flames of fight.\nThey stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,\nCondense their powers, and wait the coming war.\nNew force, new spirit, to each breast returns;\nThe fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns:\nThe king leads on: all fix on him their eye,\nAnd learn from him to conquer, or to die.\nYe sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,\nWho faced him first, and by his prowess fell?\nThe great Iphidamas, the bold and young,\nFrom sage Antenor and Theano sprung;\nWhom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,\nAnd nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.\nScarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,\nAnd early honour warm his generous breast,\nWhen the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms\n(Theano's sister) to his youthful arms.\nBut call'd by glory to the wars of Troy,\nHe leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;\nFrom his loved bride departs with melting eyes,\nAnd swift to aid his dearer country flies.\nWith twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's strand,\nThence took the long laborious march by land.\nNow fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,\nTowering in arms, and braves the king of kings.\nAtrides first discharged the missive spear;\nThe Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.\nThen near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,\nWith all his strength, the youth directs his dart:\nBut the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,\nThe point rebated, and repell'd the wound.\nEncumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands,\nTill, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands;\nAt once his weighty sword discharged a wound\nFull on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.\nStretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,\nAnd sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.\nOh worthy better fate! oh early slain!\nThy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain!\nNo more the youth shall join his consort's side,\nAt once a virgin, and at once a bride!\nNo more with presents her embraces meet,\nOr lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,\nOn whom his passion, lavish of his store,\nBestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!\nUnwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,\nWhile the proud victor bore his arms away.\nCoon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:\nTears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,\nWhile pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,\nAnd the pale features now deform'd with blood.\nThen, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,\nAim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.\nThe thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,\nAnd through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.\nSurprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear\nOn Coon rushes with his lifted spear:\nHis brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws,\nAnd calls his country to assert his cause;\nDefends him breathless on the sanguine field,\nAnd o'er the body spreads his ample shield.\nAtrides, marking an unguarded part,\nTransfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart;\nProne on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,\nThe monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away:\nThe social shades the same dark journey go,\nAnd join each other in the realms below.\nThe vengeful victor rages round the fields,\nWith every weapon art or fury yields:\nBy the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,\nWhole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.\nThis, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood;\nBut when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,\nThen grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,\nLess keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:\n(The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,\nSad mothers of unutterable woes!)\nStung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,\nHe mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;\nThen with a voice which fury made more strong,\nAnd pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:\n\"O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;\nProceed, and finish what this arm begun:\nLo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,\nAnd envies half the glories of the day.\"\nHe said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;\nThe horses fly; the chariot smokes along.\nClouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,\nAnd from their sides the foam descends in snow;\nShot through the battle in a moment's space,\nThe wounded monarch at his tent they place.\nNo sooner Hector saw the king retired,\nBut thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:\n\"Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!\nFamed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:\nNow call to mind your ancient trophies won,\nYour great forefathers' virtues, and your own.\nBehold, the general flies! deserts his powers!\nLo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!\nNow on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;\nAnd, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds.\"\nWith words like these the fiery chief alarms\nHis fainting host, and every bosom warms.\nAs the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear\nThe brindled lion, or the tusky bear:\nWith voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,\nAnd springs the foremost with his lifted dart:\nSo godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;\nNor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.\nOn the black body of the foe he pours;\nAs from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,\nA sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,\nDrives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.\nSay, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd,\nBeneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?\nAssaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,\nOpites next was added to their side;\nThen brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,\nOpheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;\n\u00c6symnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;\nThe rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.\nAs when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,\nDispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms:\nThe gust continued, violent and strong,\nRolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;\nNow to the skies the foaming billows rears,\nNow breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:\nThus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,\nO'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.\nNow the last ruin the whole host appals;\nNow Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;\nBut wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth,\nHis soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.\n\"And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!\nTill Hector's arm involve the ships in flame?\nHaste, let us join, and combat side by side.\"\nThe warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:\n\"No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;\nLet Hector come; I wait his fury here.\nBut Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:\nAnd, Jove our foe, all human force is vain.\"\nHe sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,\nAnd from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:\nMolion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,\nHis death ennobled by Ulysses' sword.\nThere slain, they left them in eternal night,\nThen plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.\nSo two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,\nThen swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.\nStern Hector's conquests in the middle plain\nStood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.\nThe sons of Merops shone amidst the war;\nTowering they rode in one refulgent car:\nIn deep prophetic arts their father skill'd,\nHad warn'd his children from the Trojan field.\nFate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain;\nThey rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain;\nTheir breasts no more the vital spirit warms;\nThe stern Tydides strips their shining arms.\nHypirochus by great Ulysses dies,\nAnd rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.\nGreat Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,\nAnd level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.\nBy Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain,\nThe far-famed hero of P\u00e6onian strain;\nWing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,\nHis steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:\nThrough broken orders, swifter than the wind,\nHe fled, but flying left his life behind.\nThis Hector sees, as his experienced eyes\nTraverse the files, and to the rescue flies;\nShouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,\nAnd moving armies on his march attend.\nGreat Diomed himself was seized with fear,\nAnd thus bespoke his brother of the war:\n\"Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!\nThe storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:\nHere stand his utmost force.\"\u2014The warrior said;\nSwift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;\nNor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced\nRazed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.\nSafe in his helm (the gift of Ph\u0153bus' hands)\nWithout a wound the Trojan hero stands;\nBut yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.\nHis arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;\nO'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,\nAnd a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.\nTydides followed to regain his lance;\nWhile Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,\nRemounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:\nThe Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:\n\"Once more thank Ph\u0153bus for thy forfeit breath,\nOr thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.\nWell by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,\nAnd oft that partial power has lent his aid.\nThou shall not long the death deserved withstand,\nIf any god assist Tydides' hand.\nFly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,\nWhole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,\"\nHim, while he triumph'd, Paris eyed from far,\n(The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)\nAround the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,\nFrom ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:\nBehind the column placed, he bent his bow,\nAnd wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;\nJust as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest\nTo seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,\nThe bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,\nBut pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.\nThe laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.\nLeaps from his ambush, and insults the king.\n\"He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!\nWould the same god had fix'd it in his heart!\nSo Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,\nShould breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:\nWhose sons now tremble at his darted spear,\nAs scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear.\"\nHe dauntless thus: \"Thou conqueror of the fair,\nThou woman-warrior with the curling hair;\nVain archer! trusting to the distant dart,\nUnskill'd in arms to act a manly part!\nThou hast but done what boys or women can;\nSuch hands may wound, but not incense a man.\nNor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,\nA coward's weapon never hurts the brave.\nNot so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel;\nFate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:\nWhere this but lights, some noble life expires;\nIts touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,\nSteeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,\nAnd leaves such objects as distract the fair.\"\nUlysses hastens with a trembling heart,\nBefore him steps, and bending draws the dart:\nForth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;\nTydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.\nNow on the field Ulysses stands alone,\nThe Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;\nBut stands collected in himself, and whole,\nAnd questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:\n\"What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?\nWhat shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?\nWhat danger, singly if I stand the ground,\nMy friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?\nYet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,\nThe brave meets danger, and the coward flies.\nTo die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;\nAnd, knowing this, I know a soldier's part.\"\nSuch thoughts revolving in his careful breast,\nNear, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;\nThese, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;\nAnd round him deep the steely circle grows.\nSo fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds\nOf shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;\nHe grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;\nHis sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;\nBy these, by those, on every part is plied;\nAnd the red slaughter spreads on every side.\nPierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;\nNext Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;\nChersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,\nFalls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.\nCharops, the son of Hippasus, was near;\nUlysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;\nBut to his aid his brother Socus flies,\nSocus the brave, the generous, and the wise.\nNear as he drew, the warrior thus began:\n\"O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!\nNot deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,\nThan worn to toils, and active in the fight!\nThis day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,\nAnd end at once the great Hippasian race,\nOr thou beneath this lance must press the field.\"\nHe said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:\nThrough the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,\nPlough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.\nBy Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,\nStopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.\nThe wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,\nThen furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):\n\"Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,\nFate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.\nNor longer check my conquests on the foe;\nBut, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,\nAnd add one spectre to the realms below!\"\nHe spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,\nTrembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;\nBetween his shoulders pierced the following dart,\nAnd held its passage through the panting heart:\nWide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;\nHe falls; his armour rings against the ground.\nThen thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:\n\"Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;\nThere ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,\nHeaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.\nAh, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;\nThy dying eyes no tender mother close;\nBut hungry birds shall tear those balls away,\nAnd hovering vultures scream around their prey.\nMe Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,\nWith solemn funerals and a lasting tomb.\"\nThen raging with intolerable smart,\nHe writhes his body, and extracts the dart.\nThe dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,\nAnd gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.\nNow troops on troops the fainting chief invade,\nForced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.\nThrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;\nThe well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:\nAlarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,\nWho shares his labours, and defends his side:\n\"O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;\nDistressed he seems, and no assistance near;\nStrong as he is, yet one opposed to all,\nOppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.\nGreece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,\nAnd feel a loss not ages can repair.\"\nThen, where the cry directs, his course he bends;\nGreat Ajax, like the god of war, attends,\nThe prudent chief in sore distress they found,\nWith bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.[223]\nAs when some huntsman, with a flying spear,\nFrom the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;\nDown his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,\nHe bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,\nTill life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,\nWild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:\nJust as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,\nThe lion rushes through the woodland shade,\nThe wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;\nThe lordly savage vindicates his prey.\nUlysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,\nA single warrior half a host sustains:\nBut soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,\nThe scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field;\nAtrides' arm the sinking hero stays,\nAnd, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.\nVictorious Ajax plies the routed crew;\nAnd first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew,\nOn strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,\nAnd lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.\nAs when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,\nPours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,\nAnd pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,\nA country's ruins! to the seas are borne:\nFierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;\nMen, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.\nBut Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,\nRaged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:\nLoud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,\nAnd deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.\nThere Nestor and Idomeneus oppose\nThe warrior's fury; there the battle glows;\nThere fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,\nHis sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.\nThe spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,\nHad pierced Machaon with a distant wound:\nIn his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,\nAnd trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.\nTo Nestor then Idomeneus begun:\n\"Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!\nAscend thy chariot, haste with speed away,\nAnd great Machaon to the ships convey;\nA wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,\nIs more than armies to the public weal.\"\nOld Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode\nThe wounded offspring of the healing god.\nHe lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet\nShake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.\nBut now Cebriones, from Hector's car,\nSurvey'd the various fortune of the war:\n\"While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,\nTrojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.\nBefore great Ajax see the mingled throng\nOf men and chariots driven in heaps along!\nI know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field\nBy the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.\nThither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,\nThere danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;\nThere horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,\nAnd groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight.\"\nThus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;\nSwift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;\nStung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,\nO'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.\nThe horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,\nAnd, dashing, purple all the car before;\nThe groaning axle sable drops distils,\nAnd mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.\nHere Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,\nBroke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:\n(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,\nThe ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)\nAjax he shuns, through all the dire debate,\nAnd fears that arm whose force he felt so late.\nBut partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,\nShot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;\nConfused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,\nAmazed he stood, with terrors not his own.\nO'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,\nAnd, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.\nThus the grim lion his retreat maintains,\nBeset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;\nRepulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,\nThough rage impels him, and though hunger calls,\nLong stands the showering darts, and missile fires;\nThen sourly slow the indignant beast retires:\nSo turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,\nWhile his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.\nAs the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,\nIn some wide field by troops of boys pursued,\nThough round his sides a wooden tempest rain,\nCrops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;\nThick on his hide the hollow blows resound,\nThe patient animal maintains his ground,\nScarce from the field with all their efforts chased,\nAnd stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:\nOn Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,\nThe strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;\nConfiding now in bulky strength he stands,\nNow turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;\nNow stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,\nAnd threats his followers with retorted eye.\nFix'd as the bar between two warring powers,\nWhile hissing darts descend in iron showers:\nIn his broad buckler many a weapon stood,\nIts surface bristled with a quivering wood;\nAnd many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,\nMarks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.\nBut bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,\nAnd dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;\nWhose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,\nGreat Apisaon felt the fatal blow;\nFrom his torn liver the red current flow'd,\nAnd his slack knees desert their dying load.\nThe victor rushing to despoil the dead,\nFrom Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;\nFix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,\nFix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.\nBack to the lines the wounded Greek retired,\nYet thus retreating, his associates fired:\n\"What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?\nOh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.\nThis hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,\nAnd this the last brave battle he shall wage:\nHaste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave\nThe warrior rescue, and your country save.\"\nThus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,\nWho spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,\nTo guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand\nWith pious care, great Ajax joins the band:\nEach takes new courage at the hero's sight;\nThe hero rallies, and renews the fight.\nThus raged both armies like conflicting fires,\nWhile Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:\nHis coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,\nThe Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.\nThat hour Achilles, from the topmost height\nOf his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;\nHis feasted eyes beheld around the plain\nThe Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.\nHis friend Machaon singled from the rest,\nA transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.\nStraight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:\nGraceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;\nIn evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,\nAnd fix'd the date of all his woes to come.",

what flattering hopes I entertain!\nAchilles heeds not, but derides our pain:\nEven till the flames consume our fleet he stays,\nAnd waits the rising of the fatal blaze.\nChief after chief the raging foe destroys;\nCalm he looks on, and every death enjoys.\nNow the slow course of all-impairing time\nUnstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;\nOh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,\nWhen this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,\nThe bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,\nAnd stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!\nThen from my fury fled the trembling swains,\nAnd ours was all the plunder of the plains:\nFifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,\nAs many goats, as many lowing kine:\nAnd thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,\nAll teeming females, and of generous breeds.\nThese, as my first essay of arms, I won;\nOld Neleus gloried in his conquering son.\nThus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,\nAnd shares were parted to each Pylian lord.\nThe state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,\nWhen the proud Elians first commenced the war:\nFor Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;\nOf twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!\nOppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,\nMy sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.\n(That large reprisal he might justly claim,\nFor prize defrauded, and insulted fame,\nWhen Elis' monarch, at the public course,\nDetain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)\nThe rest the people shared; myself survey'd\nThe just partition, and due victims paid.\nThree days were past, when Elis rose to war,\nWith many a courser, and with many a car;\nThe sons of Actor at their army's head\n(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.\nHigh on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,\nOur utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:\nNot far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:\nThe stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.\nPallas, descending in the shades of night,\nAlarms the Pylians and commands the fight.\nEach burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,\nMyself the foremost; but my sire denied;\nFear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;\nAnd stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.\nMy sire denied in vain: on foot I fled\nAmidst our chariots; for the goddess led.\n\"Along fair Arene's delightful plain\nSoft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:\nThere, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,\nAnd sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.\nThence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,\nTo great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.\nThere first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;\nAn untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;\nA bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain\nTo the blue monarch of the watery main.\nIn arms we slept, beside the winding flood,\nWhile round the town the fierce Epeians stood.\nSoon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,\nFlamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.\nBright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;\nThe nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.\nThe first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;\nKing Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:\n(She that all simples' healing virtues knew,\nAnd every herb that drinks the morning dew:)\nI seized his car, the van of battle led;\nThe Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.\nThe foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,\nFierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:\nFull fifty captive chariots graced my train;\nTwo chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.\nThen Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds\nThe youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.\nO'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,\nCollecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,\nThrough wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,\nWhere o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;\nTill Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.\nEven there the hindmost of the rear I slay,\nAnd the same arm that led concludes the day;\nThen back to Pyle triumphant take my way.\nThere to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,\nAs first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.\nSuch then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;\nSo proved my valour for my country's good.\n\"Achilles with unactive fury glows,\nAnd gives to passion what to Greece he owes.\nHow shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade\nHer hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!\nO friend!

be brave.'\nMenoetius thus: 'Though great Achilles shine\nIn strength superior, and of race divine,\nYet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;\nLet thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'\nThus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:\nWords now forgot, though now of vast import.\nAh! try the utmost that a friend can say:\nSuch gentle force the fiercest minds obey;\nSome favouring god Achilles' heart may move;\nThough deaf to glory, he may yield to love.\nIf some dire oracle his breast alarm,\nIf aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,\nSome beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,\nIf thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;\nClad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,\nProud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;\nPress'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train\nShall seek their walls, and Greece respire again.\"\nThis touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent\nAlong the shore with hasty strides he went;\nSoon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,\nThe public mart and courts of justice stand,\nWhere the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,\nAnd altars to the guardian gods arise;\nThere, sad, he met the brave Euaemon's son,\nLarge painful drops from all his members run;\nAn arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,\nThe sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.\nAs faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,\nWeak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.\nDivine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,\nWho, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd:\n\"Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!\nThus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?\nIs this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,\nFar from your friends, and from your native shore?\nSay, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?\nResists she yet the raging Hector's hand?\nOr are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,\nAnd this the period of our wars and fame?\"\nEurypylus replies: \"No more, my friend;\nGreece is no more! this day her glories end;\nEven to the ships victorious Troy pursues,\nHer force increasing as her toil renews.\nThose chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,\nLie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.\nBut, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,\nLead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;\nWith lukewarm water wash the gore away;\nWith healing balms the raging smart allay,\nSuch as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,\nOnce taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.\nOf two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands\nThis hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;\nAnd great Machaon, wounded in his tent,\nNow wants that succour which so oft he lent.\"",

shall two warriors only guard their gates,\nRepel an army, and defraud the fates?\"\nThese empty accents mingled with the wind,\nNor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;\nTo godlike Hector and his matchless might\nWas owed the glory of the destined fight.\nLike deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,\nAnd all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;\nThrough the long walls the stony showers were heard,\nThe blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.\nThe spirit of a god my breast inspire,\nTo raise each act to life, and sing with fire!\nWhile Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,\nSecure of death, confiding in despair;\nAnd all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,\nWith unassisting arms deplored the day.\nEven yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain\nThe dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.\nFirst Damasus, by Polyp\u0153tes' steel,\nPierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;\nThe weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!\nThe warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!\nNext Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:\nNor less Leonteus strews the field with death;\nFirst through the belt Hippomachus he gored,\nThen sudden waved his unresisted sword:\nAntiphates, as through the ranks he broke,\nThe falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:\nIamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;\nAnd round him rose a monument of dead.\nMeantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,\nBold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;\nFierce with impatience on the works to fall,\nAnd wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.\nThese on the farther bank now stood and gazed,\nBy Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:\nA signal omen stopp'd the passing host,\nTheir martial fury in their wonder lost.\nJove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;\nA bleeding serpent of enormous size,\nHis talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,\nHe stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:\nMad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,\nIn airy circles wings his painful way,\nFloats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:\nAmidst the host the fallen serpent lies.\nThey, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,\nAnd Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.\nThen first Polydamas the silence broke,",

our extended reign,[226]\nWhere Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,\nOur numerous herds that range the fruitful field,\nAnd hills where vines their purple harvest yield,\nOur foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,\nOur feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?\nWhy on those shores are we with joy survey'd,\nAdmired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,\nUnless great acts superior merit prove,\nAnd vindicate the bounteous powers above?\n'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;\nThe first in valour, as the first in place;\nThat when with wondering eyes our martial bands\nBehold our deeds transcending our commands,\nSuch, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,\nWhom those that envy dare not imitate!\nCould all our care elude the gloomy grave,\nWhich claims no less the fearful and the brave,\nFor lust of fame I should not vainly dare\nIn fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.\nBut since, alas! ignoble age must come,\nDisease, and death's inexorable doom,\nThe life, which others pay, let us bestow,\nAnd give to fame what we to nature owe;\nBrave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,\nOr let us glory gain, or glory give!\"\nHe said; his words the listening chief inspire\nWith equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;\nThe troops pursue their leaders with delight,\nRush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.\nMenestheus from on high the storm beheld\nThreatening the fort, and blackening in the field:\nAround the walls he gazed, to view from far\nWhat aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,\nAnd saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,\nOf fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.\nIn vain he calls; the din of helms and shields\nRings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,\nThe brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,\nHeaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.\nThen thus to Thoos: \"Hence with speed (he said),\nAnd urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;\nTheir strength, united, best may help to bear\nThe bloody labours of the doubtful war:\nHither the Lycian princes bend their course,\nThe best and bravest of the hostile force.\nBut if too fiercely there the foes contend,\nLet Telamon, at least, our towers defend,\nAnd Teucer haste with his unerring bow\nTo share the danger, and repel the foe.\"\nSwift, at the word, the herald speeds along\nThe lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,\nAnd finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,\nOpposed in combat on the dusty shore.\n\"Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!\nYour aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;\nYour strength, united, best may help to bear\nThe bloody labours of the doubtful war:\nThither the Lycian princes bend their course,\nThe best and bravest of the hostile force.\nBut if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,\nAt least, let Telamon those towers defend,\nAnd Teucer haste with his unerring bow\nTo share the danger, and repel the foe.\"\nStraight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,\nAnd thus bespoke his brothers of the war:\n\"Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,\nAnd, brave O\u00efleus, prove your force in fight;\nTo you I trust the fortune of the field,\nTill by this arm the foe shall be repell'd:\nThat done, expect me to complete the day.\nThen with his sevenfold shield he strode away.\"\nWith equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore,\nWhose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.\nHigh on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers,\nLike some black tempest gathering round the towers:\nThe Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,\nPrepared to labour in the unequal fight:\nThe war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise;\nTumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.\nFierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,\nAnd sends the brave Epicles to the shades,\nSarpedon's friend. Across the warrior's way,\nRent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;\nIn modern ages not the strongest swain\nCould heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:\nHe poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,\nIt flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;\nFull on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,\nThe ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.\nAs skilful divers from some airy steep\nHeadlong descend, and shoot into the deep,\nSo falls Epicles; then in groans expires,\nAnd murmuring to the shades the soul retires.\nWhile to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,\nFrom Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;\nThe bearded shaft the destined passage found,\nAnd on his naked arm inflicts a wound.\nThe chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast\nMight stop the progress of his warlike host,\nConceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height\nRetired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.\nDivine Sarpedon with regret beheld\nDisabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;\nHis beating breast with generous ardour glows,\nHe springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.\nAlcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;\nDeep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;\nThen from the yawning wound with fury tore\nThe spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:\nDown sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\nHis brazen armour rings against the ground.\nSwift to the battlement the victor flies,\nTugs with full force, and every nerve applies:\nIt shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;\nThe rolling ruins smoke along the field.\nA mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;\nAnd, like a deluge, rushes in the war.\nAt once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,\nAnd Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;\nFix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,\nAnd through his buckler drove the trembling wood;\nBut Jove was present in the dire debate,\nTo shield his offspring, and avert his fate.\nThe prince gave back, not meditating flight,\nBut urging vengeance, and severer fight;\nThen raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,\nHis fainting squadrons to new fury warms.\n\"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?\nYour former fame and ancient virtue lost!\nThe breach lies open, but your chief in vain\nAttempts alone the guarded pass to gain:\nUnite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:\nThe force of powerful union conquers all.\"\nThis just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;\nThey join, they thicken, and the assault renew:\nUnmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,\nAnd fix'd support the weight of all the war;\nNor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,\nNor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.\nAs on the confines of adjoining grounds,\nTwo stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;\nThey tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,\nOne foot, one inch, of the contended field;\nThus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;\nNor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.\nTheir manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,",

(Meriones replies) whose care\nLeads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;\nThis speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;\nThe rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield.\"\nTo whom the Cretan: \"Enter, and receive\nThe wonted weapons; those my tent can give;\nSpears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)\nThat shed a lustre round the illumined wall,\nThough I, disdainful of the distant war,\nNor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,\nYet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;\nAnd thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.\nEnter, and see on heaps the helmets roll'd,\nAnd high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold.\"\n\"Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;\nWe too can boast of no ignoble spoils:\nBut those my ship contains; whence distant far,\nI fight conspicuous in the van of war,\nWhat need I more? If any Greek there be\nWho knows not Merion, I appeal to thee.\"\nTo this, Idomeneus: \"The fields of fight\nHave proved thy valour, and unconquer'd might:\nAnd were some ambush for the foes design'd,\nEven there thy courage would not lag behind:\nIn that sharp service, singled from the rest,\nThe fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.\nNo force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;\nHe shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:\nA dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;\nAgainst his bosom beats his quivering heart;\nTerror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;\nWith chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,\nAnd looks a bloodless image of despair!\nNot so the brave\u2014still dauntless, still the same,\nUnchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:\nComposed his thought, determined is his eye,\nAnd fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:\nIf aught disturb the tenour of his breast,\n'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.\n\"In such assays thy blameless worth is known,\nAnd every art of dangerous war thy own.\nBy chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,\nThose wounds were glorious all, and all before;\nSuch as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight\nT'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.\nBut why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,\nStand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?\nGo\u2014from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,\nAnd to their owners send them nobly back.\"\nSwift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear\nAnd, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.\nSo Mars armipotent invades the plain,\n(The wide destroyer of the race of man,)\nTerror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,\nArm'd with stern boldness, and enormous force;\nThe pride of haughty warriors to confound,\nAnd lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:\nFrom Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms\nOf warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;\nInvoked by both, relentless they dispose,\nTo these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.\nSo march'd the leaders of the Cretan train,\nAnd their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain.\nThen first spake Merion: \"Shall we join the right,\nOr combat in the centre of the fight?\nOr to the left our wonted succour lend?\nHazard and fame all parts alike attend.\"\n\"Not in the centre (Idomen replied:)\nOur ablest chieftains the main battle guide;\nEach godlike Ajax makes that post his care,\nAnd gallant Teucer deals destruction there,\nSkill'd or with shafts to gall the distant field,\nOr bear close battle on the sounding shield.\nThese can the rage of haughty Hector tame:\nSafe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,\nTill Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,\nAnd hurl the blazing ruin at our head.\nGreat must he be, of more than human birth,\nNor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.\nHim neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,\nWhom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.\nIn standing fight he mates Achilles' force,\nExcell'd alone in swiftness in the course.\nThen to the left our ready arms apply,\nAnd live with glory, or with glory die.\"\nHe said: and Merion to th' appointed place,\nFierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.\nSoon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld\nRush like a fiery torrent o'er the field,\nTheir force embodied in a tide they pour;\nThe rising combat sounds along the shore.\nAs warring winds, in Sirius' sultry reign,\nFrom different quarters sweep the sandy plain;\nOn every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,\nAnd the dry fields are lifted to the skies:\nThus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,\nMet the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven.\nAll dreadful glared the iron face of war,\nBristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar;\nDire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,\nAnd polish'd arms emblazed the flaming fields:\nTremendous scene!

            "text": "This Asius view'd, unable to contain,\nBefore his chariot warring on the plain:\n(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,\nImpatient panted on his neck behind:)\nTo vengeance rising with a sudden spring,\nHe hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.\nThe wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,\nFull on his throat discharged the forceful spear:\nBeneath the chin the point was seen to glide,\nAnd glitter'd, extant at the further side.\nAs when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,\nOr pine, fit mast for some great admiral,\nGroans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,\nThen spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground:\nSo sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,\nAnd stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.\nHe grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,\nAnd, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.\nDeprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,\nStands all aghast his trembling charioteer,\nNor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,\nBut falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:\nPierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath\nThe stately car, and labours out his breath.\nThus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)\nRemain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.\nStabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,\nAnd made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.\nThe Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance\nFrom his slope shield the disappointed lance.\nBeneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,\nThick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,\nOn his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,)\nHe lay collected in defensive shade.\nO'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,\nAnd on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.\nEven then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,\nAnd pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast:\nWarm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore\nThe chief, his people's guardian now no more!\n\"Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)\nNor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:\nFor thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,\nThis mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.\"\nHeart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,\nTouch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most.\nGrieved as he was, his pious arms attend,\nAnd his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend:\nTill sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore\nHis honour'd body to the tented shore.\nNor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;\nResolved to perish in his country's cause,\nOr find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom\nTo wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.\nHe sees Alcathous in the front aspire:\nGreat \u00c6syetes was the hero's sire;\nHis spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,\nAnchises' eldest hope, and darling care:\nWho charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart\nWith beauty, sense, and every work of art:\nHe once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy,\nThe fairest she of all the fair of Troy.\nBy Neptune now the hapless hero dies,\nWho covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,\nAnd fetters every limb: yet bent to meet\nHis fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.\nFix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,\nWhile the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.\nBefore the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,\nLong used to ward the death in fighting fields.\nThe riven armour sends a jarring sound;\nHis labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,\nThe long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;\nFast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,\nLife's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.\nThen Idomen, insulting o'er the slain:\n\"Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:\nSee! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;\nThis, my third victim, to the shades I send.\nApproaching now thy boasted might approve,\nAnd try the prowess of the seed of Jove.\nFrom Jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,\nGreat Minos, guardian of his country, came:\nDeucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir;\nHis first-born I, the third from Jupiter:\nO'er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,\nAnd thence my ships transport me through the main:\nLord of a host, o'er all my host I shine,\nA scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line.\"\nThe Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,\nAlone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,\nOr seek auxiliar force; at length decreed\nTo call some hero to partake the deed,\nForthwith \u00c6neas rises to his thought:\nFor him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,\nWhere he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,\nAnd sees superior posts in meaner hands.\nTo him, ambitious of so great an aid,\nThe bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said:\n\"Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,\nIf e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.\nAlcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;\nCome, and the warrior's loved remains defend.\nBeneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,\nOne table fed you, and one roof contain'd.\nThis deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;\nHaste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe.\"\n\u00c6neas heard, and for a space resign'd\nTo tender pity all his manly mind;\nThen rising in his rage, he burns to fight:\nThe Greek awaits him with collected might.\nAs the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,\nArm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,\nWhen the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,\nAttends the tumult, and expects the war;\nO'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;\nFires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,\nHis foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;\nBut most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:\nSo stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,\nAnd met the Trojan with a lowering look.\nAntilochus, Deipyrus, were near,\nThe youthful offspring of the god of war,\nMerion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:\nTo these the warrior sent his voice around.\n\"Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;\nLo, great \u00c6neas rushes to the fight:\nSprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;\nHe fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.\nElse should this hand, this hour decide the strife,\nThe great dispute, of glory, or of life.\"\nHe spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;\nTheir lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade\nAround the chief. \u00c6neas too demands\nTh' assisting forces of his native bands;\nParis, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;\n(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)\nIn order follow all th' embodied train,\nLike Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;\nBefore his fleecy care, erect and bold,\nStalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.\nWith joy the swain surveys them, as he leads\nTo the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:\nSo joys \u00c6neas, as his native band\nMoves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.\nRound dread Alcathous now the battle rose;\nOn every side the steely circle grows;\nNow batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,\nAnd o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.\nAbove the rest, two towering chiefs appear,\nThere great Idomeneus, \u00c6neas here.\nLike gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,\nAnd burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.\nThe Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;\nThe Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:\nSent from an arm so strong, the missive wood\nStuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.\nBut OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;\nThe forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,\nIt ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,\nAnd roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.\nStretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,\nAnd, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.\nThe victor from his breast the weapon tears;\nHis spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.\nThough now unfit an active war to wage,\nHeavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,\nHis listless limbs unable for the course,\nIn standing fight he yet maintains his force;\nTill faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,\nHis tired slow steps he drags from off the field.\nDeiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,\nAnd, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:\nThe javelin err'd, but held its course along,\nAnd pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:\nThe son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,\nAnd gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.\nNor knew the furious father of his fall;\nHigh-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,\nOn golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;\nDetain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.\nNow, where in dust the breathless hero lay,\nFor slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,\nDeiphobus to seize his helmet flies,\nAnd from his temples rends the glittering prize;\nValiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,\nAnd on his loaded arm discharged his spear:\nHe drops the weight, disabled with the pain;\nThe hollow helmet rings against the plain.\nSwift as a vulture leaping on his prey,\nFrom his torn arm the Grecian rent away\nThe reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.\nHis wounded brother good Polites tends;\nAround his waist his pious arms he threw,\nAnd from the rage of battle gently drew:\nHim his swift coursers, on his splendid car,\nRapt from the lessening thunder of the war;\nTo Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,\nAnd sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.\nMeanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,\nHeaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.\nBold Aphareus by great \u00c6neas bled;\nAs toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,\nHe pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd\nBeneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;\nHis shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,\nAnd everlasting slumber seals his eyes.\nAntilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,\nTranspierced his back with a dishonest wound:\nThe hollow vein, that to the neck extends\nAlong the chine, his eager javelin rends:\nSupine he falls, and to his social train\nSpreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.\nThv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,\nFrom his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;\nHis time observed; for closed by foes around,\nOn all sides thick the peals of arms resound.\nHis shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,\nBut he impervious and untouch'd remains.\n(Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage\nThis youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)\nIn arms intrepid, with the first he fought,\nFaced every foe, and every danger sought;\nHis winged lance, resistless as the wind,\nObeys each motion of the master's mind!\nRestless it flies, impatient to be free,\nAnd meditates the distant enemy.\nThe son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,\nAnd struck his target with the brazen spear\nFierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,\nAnd blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:\nIn the broad buckler half the weapon stood,\nSplinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.\nDisarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;\nBut Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,\nDeep in the belly's rim an entrance found,\nWhere sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.\nBending he fell, and doubled to the ground,\nLay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,\nWhile death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,\nHis bulk enormous on the field displays;\nHis heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.\nThe spear the conqueror from his body drew,\nAnd death's dim shadows swarm before his view.\nNext brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:\nKing Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,\nAnd smote his temples with an arm so strong,\nThe helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:\nThere for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;\nFor dark in death the godlike owner lies!\nRaging with grief, great Menelaus burns,\nAnd fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:\nThat shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;\nAnd this stood adverse with the bended bow:\nFull on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,\nBut harmless bounded from the plated steel.\nAs on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,\n(The winds collected at each open door,)\nWhile the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,\nLight leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:\nSo from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,\nRepell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.\nAtrides, watchful of the unwary foe,\nPierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.\nAnd nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand\nTrail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:\nBut good Agenor gently from the wound\nThe spear solicits, and the bandage bound;\nA sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,\nAt once the tent and ligature supplied.\nBehold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,\nSprings through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,\nGreat Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:\nHigh-towering in the front, the warrior came.\nFirst the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;\nThe lance far distant by the winds was blown.\nNor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:\nPisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.\nNot so discouraged, to the future blind,\nVain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;\nDauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord\nLike lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.\nHis left arm high opposed the shining shield:\nHis right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;\n(An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,\nDistinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)\nThis on the helm discharged a noble blow;\nThe plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,\nShorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:\nDeep through his front the weighty falchion fell;\nThe crashing bones before its force gave way;\nIn dust and blood the groaning hero lay:\nForced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,\nThe clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.\nAnd fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,\nTore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:\n\"Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;\nO race perfidious, who delight in war!\nAlready noble deeds ye have perform'd;\nA princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:\nIn such bold feats your impious might approve,\nWithout th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.\nThe violated rites, the ravish'd dame;\nOur heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,\nCrimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,\nAnd whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.\nO thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,\nAbove the thought of man, supremely wise!\nIf from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,\nFrom whence this favour to an impious foe?\nA godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,\nStill breathing rapine, violence, and lust?\nThe best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;\nSleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;\nThe feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,\nEven the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.\nBut Troy for ever reaps a dire delight\nIn thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.\"\nThis said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)\nThe bloody armour, which his train received:\nThen sudden mix'd among the warring crew,\nAnd the bold son of Pyl\u00e6menes slew.\nHarpalion had through Asia travell'd far,\nFollowing his martial father to the war:\nThrough filial love he left his native shore,\nNever, ah, never to behold it more!\nHis unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling\nAgainst the target of the Spartan king;\nThus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,\nAnd turns around his apprehensive eyes.\nHim, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,\nThe shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.\nBeneath the bone the glancing point descends,\nAnd, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:\nSunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,\nAnd in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;\n(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)\nWhile life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.\nHim on his car the Paphlagonian train\nIn slow procession bore from off the plain.\nThe pensive father, father now no more!\nAttends the mournful pomp along the shore;\nAnd unavailing tears profusely shed;\nAnd, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.\nParis from far the moving sight beheld,\nWith pity soften'd and with fury swell'd:\nHis honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,\nAnd loved of all the Paphlagonian race!\nWith his full strength he bent his angry bow,\nAnd wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.\nA chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,\nFor riches much, and more for virtue famed.\nWho held his seat in Corinth's stately town;\nPolydus' son, a seer of old renown.\nOft had the father told his early doom,\nBy arms abroad, or slow disease at home:\nHe climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,\nAnd chose the certain glorious path to death.\nBeneath his ear the pointed arrow went;\nThe soul came issuing at the narrow vent:\nHis limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,\nAnd everlasting darkness shades him round.\nNor knew great Hector how his legions yield,\n(Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)\nWide on the left the force of Greece commands,\nAnd conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands;\nWith such a tide superior virtue sway'd,\nAnd he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.\nBut in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd,\nWhere first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;\nThere, on the margin of the hoary deep,\n(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.\nAnd where low walls confine the beating tides,\nWhose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;\nWhere late in fight both foot and horse engaged,\nAnd all the thunder of the battle raged,)\nThere join'd, the whole B\u0153otian strength remains,\nThe proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,\nLocrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;\nBut join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.\nThe flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;\nBias and great Menestheus at their head:\nMeges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,\nAnd Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:\nThe Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,\nAnd brave Podarces, active in the fight.\nThis drew from Phylacus his noble line;\nIphiclus' son: and that (O\u00efleus) thine:\n(Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace;\nHe dwelt far distant from his native place,\nBy his fierce step-dame from his father's reign\nExpell'd and exiled for her brother slain:)\nThese rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,\nMix'd with B\u0153otians, on the shores of Troy.\nNow side by side, with like unwearied care,\nEach Ajax laboured through the field of war:\nSo when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,\nForce the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,\nJoin'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,\nAnd trace large furrows with the shining share;\nO'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,\nAnd streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.\nA train of heroes followed through the field,\nWho bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;\nWhene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,\nTired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.\nNo following troops his brave associate grace:\nIn close engagement an unpractised race,\nThe Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,\nNor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;\nBut skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,\nOr whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,\nDexterous with these they aim a certain wound,\nOr fell the distant warrior to the ground.\nThus in the van the Telamonian train,\nThrong'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:\nFar in the rear the Locrian archers lie,\nWhose stones and arrows intercept the sky,\nThe mingled tempest on the foes they pour;\nTroy's scattering orders open to the shower.\nNow had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,\nAnd the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired;\nBut sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,\nAddress'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:\n\"Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend\nImpartial audience to a faithful friend;\nTo gods and men thy matchless worth is known,\nAnd every art of glorious war thy own;\nBut in cool thought and counsel to excel,\nHow widely differs this from warring well!\nContent with what the bounteous gods have given,\nSeek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.\nTo some the powers of bloody war belong,\nTo some sweet music and the charm of song;\nTo few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd\nA wise, extensive, all-considering mind;\nTheir guardians these, the nations round confess,\nAnd towns and empires for their safety bless.\nIf Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,\nAttend, O Hector! what I judge the best,\nSee, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,\nAnd war's whole fury burns around thy head.\nBehold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,\nHow many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!\nWhat troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!\nAnd what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!\nHere cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings\nConvoked to council, weigh the sum of things.\nWhether (the gods succeeding our desires)\nTo yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;\nOr quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,\nContented with the conquest of the day.\nI fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,\nPay the large debt of last revolving sun;\nAchilles, great Achilles, yet remains\nOn yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!\"",

Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.\nVain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,\nTo force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.\nLong ere in flames our lofty navy fall,\nYour boasted city, and your god-built wall,\nShall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;\nAnd spread a long unmeasured ruin round.\nThe time shall come, when, chased along the plain,\nEven thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;\nEven thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,\nThe wings of falcons for thy flying horse;\nShalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,\nWhile clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.\"\nAs thus he spoke, behold, in open view,\nOn sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.\nTo Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise,\nAnd hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:\nFar-echoing clamours bound from side to side;\nThey ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:\n\"From whence this menace, this insulting strain?\nEnormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.\nSo may the gods on Hector life bestow,\n(Not that short life which mortals lead below,\nBut such as those of Jove's high lineage born,\nThe blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)\nAs this decisive day shall end the fame\nOf Greece, and Argos be no more a name.\nAnd thou, imperious! if thy madness wait\nThe lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:\nThat giant-corse, extended on the shore,\nShall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore.\"\nHe said; and like a lion stalk'd along:\nWith shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,\nSent from his following host: the Grecian train\nWith answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;\nA shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,\nShook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.\n[Illustration: ] GREEK EARRINGS",

The Trojans, at\nthe sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for that hero,\nare cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the\nvessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was\naverse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are\ndescribed; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of\nAchilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses\nand disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which\nconcludes the book.",

Thou gav'st, at Thetis' prayer,\nGlory to me, and to the Greeks despair.\nLo, to the dangers of the fighting field\nThe best, the dearest of my friends, I yield,\nThough still determined, to my ships confined;\nPatroclus gone, I stay but half behind.\nOh! be his guard thy providential care,\nConfirm his heart, and string his arm to war:\nPress'd by his single force let Hector see\nHis fame in arms not owing all to me.\nBut when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,\nLet him with conquest and renown retire;\nPreserve his arms, preserve his social train,\nAnd safe return him to these eyes again!\"\nGreat Jove consents to half the chief's request,\nBut heaven's eternal doom denies the rest;\nTo free the fleet was granted to his prayer;\nHis safe return, the winds dispersed in air.\nBack to his tent the stern Achilles flies,\nAnd waits the combat with impatient eyes.\nMeanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus' care,\nInvade the Trojans, and commence the war.\nAs wasps, provoked by children in their play,\nPour from their mansions by the broad highway,\nIn swarms the guiltless traveller engage,\nWhet all their stings, and call forth all their rage:\nAll rise in arms, and, with a general cry,\nAssert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny.\nThus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,\nSo loud their clamours, and so keen their arms:\nTheir rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires,\nWho thus inflames them with heroic fires:\n\"O warriors, partners of Achilles' praise!\nBe mindful of your deeds in ancient days;\nYour godlike master let your acts proclaim,\nAnd add new glories to his mighty name.\nThink your Achilles sees you fight: be brave,\nAnd humble the proud monarch whom you save.\"\nJoyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke,\nFlew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke.",

Next, Thoas was thy chance;\nThy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.\nPhylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)\nHis blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,\nTore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;\nIn darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.\nIn equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,\nAnd two bold brothers of the Lycian band:\nBy great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,\nPierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,\nKind Maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,\nDefends the breathless carcase on the ground;\nFurious he flies, his murderer to engage:\nBut godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,\nBetween his arm and shoulder aims a blow;\nHis arm falls spouting on the dust below:\nHe sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er:\nAnd vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.\nSlain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,\nSarpedon's friends, Amisodarus' seed;\nAmisodarus, who, by Furies led,\nThe bane of men, abhorr'd Chimaera bred;\nSkill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire,\nAnd pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.\nStopp'd in the tumult Cleobulus lies,\nBeneath O\u00efleus' arm, a living prize;\nA living prize not long the Trojan stood;\nThe thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:\nPlunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;\nBlack death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.\nAmid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,\nLycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;\nIn vain their javelins at each other flew,\nNow, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.\nOn the plumed crest of his B\u0153otian foe\nThe daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow;\nThe sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped\nFull on the juncture of the neck and head:\nThe head, divided by a stroke so just,\nHung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.\nO'ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,\nPierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;\nBack from the car he tumbles to the ground:\nHis swimming eyes eternal shades surround.\nNext Erymas was doom'd his fate to feel,\nHis open'd mouth received the Cretan steel:\nBeneath the brain the point a passage tore,\nCrash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore:\nHis mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;\nHe sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.\nAs when the flocks neglected by the swain,\nOr kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain,\nA troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,\nAnd rend the trembling, unresisting prey:\nThus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;\nTroy fled, unmindful of her former fame.\nBut still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd,\nStill, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.\nThe Trojan chief, experienced in the field,\nO'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,\nObserved the storm of darts the Grecians pour,\nAnd on his buckler caught the ringing shower:\nHe sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,\nYet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.\nAs when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,\nAnd rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,\nDark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies,\nAnd shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:\nSo from the ships, along the dusky plain,\nDire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.\nEven Hector fled; through heads of disarray\nThe fiery coursers forced their lord away:\nWhile far behind his Trojans fall confused;\nWedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:\nChariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes\nShock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.\nIn vain they labour up the steepy mound;\nTheir charioteers lie foaming on the ground.\nFierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;\nTumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;",

as the spear was shook,\nHe fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.\nNext on Eryalus he flies; a stone,\nLarge as a rock, was by his fury thrown:\nFull on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,\nAnd burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:\nProne to the ground the breathless warrior fell,\nAnd death involved him with the shades of hell.\nThen low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;\nIpheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;\nAmphoterus and Erymas succeed;\nAnd last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.\nWhere'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread\nIn heaps on heaps a monument of dead.\nWhen now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld\nGrovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,\nWith this reproach his flying host he warms:\n\"Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!\nForsake, inglorious, the contended plain;\nThis hand unaided shall the war sustain:\nThe task be mine this hero's strength to try,\nWho mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.\"\nHe spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:\nPatroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.\nAs when two vultures on the mountain's height\nStoop with resounding pinions to the fight;\nThey cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;\nThe desert echoes, and the rocks reply:\nThe warriors thus opposed in arms, engage\nWith equal clamours, and with equal rage.\nJove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen,\nHe thus bespoke his sister and his queen:\n\"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,[245]\nMy godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:\nAlready on the verge of death he stands,\nHis life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,\nWhat passions in a parent's breast debate!\nSay, shall I snatch him from impending fate,\nAnd send him safe to Lycia, distant far\nFrom all the dangers and the toils of war;\nOr to his doom my bravest offspring yield,\nAnd fatten, with celestial blood, the field?\"\nThen thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:\n\"What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!\nShort is the date prescribed to mortal man;\nShall Jove for one extend the narrow span,\nWhose bounds were fix'd before his race began?\nHow many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,\nBefore proud Ilion must resign their breath!\nWere thine exempt, debate would rise above,\nAnd murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.\nGive the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;\nAnd when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,\nLet Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,\nThe breathless body to his native land.\nHis friends and people, to his future praise,\nA marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,\nAnd lasting honours to his ashes give;\nHis fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live.\"\nShe said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,\nAssents to fate, and ratifies the doom.\nThen touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd\nA shower of blood o'er all the fatal field:\nThe god, his eyes averting from the plain,\nLaments his son, predestined to be slain,\nFar from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.\nNow met in arms, the combatants appear;\nEach heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;\nFrom strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled,\nAnd pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed;\nThe nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,\nHe falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.\nTwo sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:\nThe first aloof with erring fury flew,\nThe next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed,\nThe generous Pedasus of Theban breed:\nFix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,\nRoll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.\nHis sudden fall the entangled harness broke;\nEach axle crackled, and the chariot shook:\nWhen bold Automedon, to disengage\nThe starting coursers, and restrain their rage,\nDivides the traces with his sword, and freed\nThe encumbered chariot from the dying steed:\nThe rest move on, obedient to the rein:\nThe car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.\nThe towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:\nAnd first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,\nWhich o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,\nAnd spent in empty air its dying force.\nNot so Patroclus' never-erring dart;\nAim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,\nWhere the strong fibres bind the solid heart.\nThen as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,\nOr pine (fit mast for some great admiral)\nNods to the axe, till with a groaning sound\nIt sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,\nThus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,\nBefore his chariot stretch'd his form divine:\nHe grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,\nAnd, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.\nSo lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,\nWhile the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws\nThe trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;\nDeep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.\nThen to the leader of the Lycian band\nThe dying chief address'd his last command;\n\"Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare\nThe glorious dangers of destructive war,\nTo lead my troops, to combat at their head,\nIncite the living, and supply the dead.\nTell them, I charged them with my latest breath\nNot unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.\nWhat grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,\nIf these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!\nThen as a friend, and as a warrior fight;\nDefend my body, conquer in my right:\nThat, taught by great examples, all may try\nLike thee to vanquish, or like me to die.\"\nHe ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,\nAnd his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.\nThe insulting victor with disdain bestrode\nThe prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;\nThen drew the weapon from his panting heart,\nThe reeking fibres clinging to the dart;\nFrom the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,\nAnd the soul issued in the purple flood.\nHis flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,\nUnguided now, their mighty master slain.\nAll-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,\nUnhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:\nHis painful arm, yet useless with the smart\nInflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,\nSupported on his better hand he stay'd:\nTo Ph\u0153bus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:\n\"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,\nOr sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,\nPowerful alike to ease the wretch's smart;\nO hear me! god of every healing art!\nLo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,\nThat thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,\nI stand unable to sustain the spear,\nAnd sigh, at distance from the glorious war.\nLow in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,\nNor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;\nBut thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,\nTo guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend:\nFor thou, though distant, canst restore my might,\nTo head my Lycians, and support the fight.\"\nApollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,\nHis heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;\nHe drew the dolours from the wounded part,\nAnd breathed a spirit in his rising heart.\nRenew'd by art divine, the hero stands,\nAnd owns the assistance of immortal hands.\nFirst to the fight his native troops he warms,\nThen loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;\nWith ample strides he stalks from place to place;\nNow fires Agenor, now Polydamas:\n\u00c6neas next, and Hector he accosts;\nInflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.\n\"What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?\nOh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!\nThose generous friends, who, from their country far,\nBreathe their brave souls out in another's war.\nSee! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,\nIn action valiant, and in council wise,\nWho guarded right, and kept his people free;\nTo all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!\nStretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains,\nO save from hostile rage his loved remains!\nAh let not Greece his conquer'd trophies boast,\nNor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!\"\nHe spoke: each leader in his grief partook:\nTroy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.\nTransfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown\nAt once his country's pillar, and their own;\nA chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall\nA host of heroes, and outshined them all.\nFired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,\nAnd with superior vengeance greatly glows.\nBut o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,\nAnd rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:\n\"Heroes, be men; be what you were before;\nOr weigh the great occasion, and be more.\nThe chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,\nLies pale in death, extended on the field.\nTo guard his body Troy in numbers flies;\n'Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.\nHaste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,\nAnd send the living Lycians to the dead.\"\nThe heroes kindle at his fierce command;\nThe martial squadrons close on either hand:\nHere Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,\nThessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.\nWith horrid shouts they circle round the slain;\nThe clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.\nGreat Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,\nO'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,\nAnd round his son confounds the warring hosts,\nHis fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.\nNow Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;\nAgacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls;\nWho chased for murder thence a suppliant came\nTo Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;\nNow sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid,\nHe pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.\nSoon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,\nA rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;\nHurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain\nHis shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.\nFierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,\nAnd, like an eagle darting at his game,\nSprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.\nWhat grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,\nO generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,\nAt Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,\nWhich sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near\nThat arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.\nFar as an able hand a lance can throw,\nOr at the lists, or at the fighting foe;\nSo far the Trojans from their lines retired;\nTill Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.\nThen Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,\nThe only hope of Chalcon's trembling age;\nWide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,\nWith stately seats, and riches blest in vain:\nHim, bold with youth, and eager to pursue\nThe flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;\nPierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,\nHe fell, and falling made the fields resound.\nThe Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;\nWith conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,\nAnd crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;\nAn iron circle round the carcase grows.\nThen brave Laogonus resign'd his breath,\nDespatch'd by Merion to the shades of death:\nOn Ida's holy hill he made abode,\nThe priest of Jove, and honour'd like his god.\nBetween the jaw and ear the javelin went;\nThe soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.\nHis spear \u00c6neas at the victor threw,\nWho stooping forward from the death withdrew;\nThe lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,\nAnd trembling struck, and rooted in the field;\nThere yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,\nSent by the great \u00c6neas' arm in vain.\n\"Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)\nAnd skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,\nMy spear, the destined passage had it found,\nHad fix'd thy active vigour to the ground.\"\n\"O valiant leader of the Dardan host!\n(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)\nStrong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,\nAn arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.\nAnd if to this my lance thy fate be given,\nVain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:\nThis, instant, sends thee down to Pluto's coast;\nMine is the glory, his thy parting ghost.\"\n\"O friend (Menoetius' son this answer gave)\nWith words to combat, ill befits the brave;\nNot empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,\nYour swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.\nTo speak, beseems the council; but to dare\nIn glorious action, is the task of war.\"\nThis said, Patroclus to the battle flies;\nGreat Merion follows, and new shouts arise:\nShields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;\nAnd thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.\nAs through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,\nThe labours of the woodman's axe resound;\nBlows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,\nWhile crackling forests fall on every side:\nThus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,\nSo fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.\nNow great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,\nHis heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,\nAnd stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,\nLies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead.\nHis long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,\nOn every side the busy combat grows;\nThick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode\n(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)\nThe buzzing flies, a persevering train,\nIncessant swarm, and chased return again.\nJove view'd the combat with a stern survey,\nAnd eyes that flash'd intolerable day.\nFix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates\nThe vengeance due, and meditates the fates:\nWhether to urge their prompt effect, and call\nThe force of Hector to Patroclus' fall,\nThis instant see his short-lived trophies won,\nAnd stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd son;\nOr yet, with many a soul's untimely flight,\nAugment the fame and horror of the fight.\nTo crown Achilles' valiant friend with praise\nAt length he dooms; and, that his last of days\nShall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;\nNor unattended see the shades below.\nThen Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay;\nHe mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;\nSunk with Troy's heavy fates, he sees decline\nThe scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.\nThen, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,\nAnd left their monarch with the common dead:\nAround, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall\nOf carnage rises, as the heroes fall.\n(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain\nThe prize contested, and despoil the slain.\nThe radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;\nPatroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.\nThen thus to Ph\u0153bus, in the realms above,\nSpoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:\n\"Descend, my Ph\u0153bus! on the Phrygian plain,\nAnd from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;\nThen bathe his body in the crystal flood,\nWith dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with blood;\nO'er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,\nAnd with celestial robes adorn the dead.\nThose rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath\nTo the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.\nThey to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;\nHis friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:\nWhat honour mortals after death receive,\nThose unavailing honours we may give!\"\n[Illustration: ] SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO\nLYCIA\nApollo bows, and from mount Ida's height,\nSwift to the field precipitates his flight;\nThence from the war the breathless hero bore,\nVeil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore;\nThere bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd\nHis manly members in the immortal vest;\nAnd with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews\nRestores his freshness, and his form renews.\nThen Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,\nOf matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,\nReceived Sarpedon, at the god's command,\nAnd in a moment reach'd the Lycian land;\nThe corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,\nWhere endless honours wait the sacred shade.\nMeanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,\nWith foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins.\nFierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,\nAh blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:\nAgainst what fate and powerful Jove ordain,\nVain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain.\nFor he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd\nDismay the mighty, and confound the bold;\nThe god who gives, resumes, and orders all,\nHe urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.\nWho first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,\nWho last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain;\nWhen heaven itself thy fatal fury led,\nAnd call'd to fill the number of the dead?\nAdrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;\nEcheclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,\nEpistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;\nThe slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown'd:\nThen sunk Pylartes to eternal night;\nThe rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.\nNow Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,\nBut flaming Ph\u0153bus kept the sacred tower.\nThrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;[246]\nHis blazing \u00e6gis thrice Apollo shook;\nHe tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,\nA more than mortal voice was heard aloud.\n\"Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall\nDefies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;\nThy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,\nTroy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand.\"\nSo spoke the god who darts celestial fires;\nThe Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.\nWhile Hector, checking at the Sc\u00e6an gates\nHis panting coursers, in his breast debates,\nOr in the field his forces to employ,\nOr draw the troops within the walls of Troy.\nThus while he thought, beside him Ph\u0153bus stood,\nIn Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;\n(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,\nA valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)\nThus he accosts him. \"What a shameful sight!\nGod! is it Hector that forbears the fight?\nWere thine my vigour this successful spear\nShould soon convince thee of so false a fear.\nTurn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,\nAnd in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.\nPerhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,\nAnd heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.\"\nSo spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,\nAnd plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.\nHe bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;\nThe lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.\nThe god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,\nAnd pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.\nPatroclus lights, impatient for the fight;\nA spear his left, a stone employs his right:\nWith all his nerves he drives it at the foe.\nPointed above, and rough and gross below:\nThe falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,\nThe lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;\nHis front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:\nThe bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.\nThe charioteer, while yet he held the rein,\nStruck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.\nTo the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,\nWhile the proud victor thus his fall derides.\n\"Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!\nWhat skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!\nMark with what ease they sink into the sand!\nPity that all their practice is by land!\"\nThen rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,\nTo spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:\nSwift as a lion, terrible and bold,\nThat sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;\nPierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,\nAnd from his fatal courage finds his bane.\nAt once bold Hector leaping from his car,\nDefends the body, and provokes the war.\nThus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,\nTwo lordly rulers of the wood engage;\nStung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,\nAnd echoing roars rebellow through the shades.\nStern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,\nAnd by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:\nWhile all around, confusion, rage, and fright,\nMix the contending hosts in mortal fight.\nSo pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud\nIn the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;\nLeaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,\nThe broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;\nThis way and that, the rattling thicket bends,\nAnd the whole forest in one crash descends.\nNot with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,\nIn dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.\nDarts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;\nNow flights of arrows bounding from the string:\nStones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,\nSome hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.\nBut where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,\nSunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,\nAnd, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!\nNow flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven\nHis fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;\nWhile on each host with equal tempests fell\nThe showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.\nBut when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,\nGlad conquest rested on the Grecian train.\nThen from amidst the tumult and alarms,\nThey draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.\nThen rash Patroclus with new fury glows,\nAnd breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.\nThrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,\nAnd thrice three heroes at each onset slew.\nThere ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine\nThe last, black remnant of so bright a line:\nApollo dreadful stops thy middle way;\nDeath calls, and heaven allows no longer day!\nFor lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,\nApproaching dealt a staggering blow behind.\nThe weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;\nHis eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel\nIn giddy darkness; far to distance flung,\nHis bounding helmet on the champaign rung.\nAchilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;\nThat plume which never stoop'd to earth before;\nLong used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,\nAnd shade the temples of the mad divine.\nJove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;\nNot long\u2014for fate pursues him, and the god.\nHis spear in shivers falls; his ample shield\nDrops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:\nThe corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:\nLoose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;\nStupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:\nSuch is the force of more than mortal hands!\nA Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,\nFrom Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;\nFamed for the manage of the foaming horse,\nSkill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:\nFull twenty knights he tumbled from the car,\nWhile yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.\nHis venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;\nHe struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.\nNor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:\nBut swift withdrew the long-protended wood.\nAnd turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.\nThus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,\nWounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,\nRetires for succour to his social train,\nAnd flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.\nStern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,\nBreaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:\nThe lance arrests him with a mortal wound;\nHe falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.\nWith him all Greece was sunk; that moment all\nHer yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.\nSo, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,\nThe roaming lion meets a bristly boar,\nFast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,\nWith flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;\nAt length the sovereign savage wins the strife;\nAnd the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.\nPatroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,\nSo many lives effused, expires his own.",

in life's first bloom he fell,\nSent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.\nOnce more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies;\nThe Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,\nShunn'd the descending death; which hissing on,\nStretch'd in the dust the great Iphytus' son,\nSchedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind\nThe boldest warrior and the noblest mind:\nIn little Panope, for strength renown'd,\nHe held his seat, and ruled the realms around.\nPlunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,\nAnd deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;\nIn clanging arms the hero fell and all\nThe fields resounded with his weighty fall.\nPhorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,\nThe Telamonian lance his belly rends;\nThe hollow armour burst before the stroke,\nAnd through the wound the rushing entrails broke:\nIn strong convulsions panting on the sands\nHe lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.\nStruck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:\nThe shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.\nAnd now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,\nFled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;\nGreece, in her native fortitude elate,\nWith Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:\nBut Ph\u0153bus urged \u00c6neas to the fight;\nHe seem'd like aged Periphas to sight:\n(A herald in Anchises' love grown old,\nRevered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)\nThus he\u2014\"What methods yet, O chief! remain,\nTo save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?\nThere have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,\nBy valour, numbers, and by arts of war,\nHave forced the powers to spare a sinking state,\nAnd gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:\nBut you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares\nHis partial favour, and assists your wars,\nYour shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,\nAnd force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.\"\n\u00c6neas through the form assumed descries\nThe power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries:\n\"Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,\nWe seek our ramparts, and desert the day.\nA god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,\nAnd tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.\"\nHe spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:\nThe bold example all his hosts pursue.\nThen, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,\nIn vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;\nWho view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,\nSwift to revenge it sent his angry lance;\nThe whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,\nDescends, and pants in Apisaon's breast;\nFrom rich Paeonia's vales the warrior came,\nNext thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.\nAsteropeus with grief beheld the slain,\nAnd rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain:\nIndissolubly firm, around the dead,\nRank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,\nAnd hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,\nA brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.\nGreat Ajax eyes them with incessant care,\nAnd in an orb contracts the crowded war,\nClose in their ranks commands to fight or fall,\nAnd stands the centre and the soul of all:\nFix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;\nA sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:\nOn heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,\nAnd, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.\nGreece, in close order, and collected might,\nYet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;\nFierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,\nAnd now it rises, now it sinks by turns.\nIn one thick darkness all the fight was lost;\nThe sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host\nSeem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes,\nAnd all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.\nSuch o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,\nThe rest in sunshine fought, and open light;\nUnclouded there, the aerial azure spread,\nNo vapour rested on the mountain's head,\nThe golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,\nAnd all the broad expansion flamed with day.\nDispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,\nAnd here and there their scatter'd arrows light:\nBut death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,\nThere burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.\nMeanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,\n(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,\nAnd skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,\nWhen from the ships he sent the Pylian band.\nThe youthful brothers thus for fame contend,\nNor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;\nIn thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,\nGlorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.\nBut round the corse the heroes pant for breath,\nAnd thick and heavy grows the work of death:\nO'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,\nTheir knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er;\nDrops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,\nAnd carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.\nAs when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,\nStrain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,\nThe brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er\nThe extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:\nSo tugging round the corse both armies stood;\nThe mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;\nWhile Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,\nNow to the ships to force it, now to Troy.\nNot Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,\nNor he whose anger sets the world in arms,\nCould blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd;\nSuch, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.\nAchilles in his ships at distance lay,\nNor knew the fatal fortune of the day;\nHe, yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall,\nIn dust extended under Ilion's wall,\nExpects him glorious from the conquered plain,\nAnd for his wish'd return prepares in vain;\nThough well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend\nWas more than heaven had destined to his friend.\nPerhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd;\nThe rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.\nStill raged the conflict round the hero dead,\nAnd heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.\n\"Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)\nWho dares desert this well-disputed day!\nFirst may the cleaving earth before our eyes\nGape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;\nFirst perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast\nWe lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!\"\nThus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,\n\"Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!\"\nThen clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,\nAnd shake the brazen concave of the skies.\nMeantime, at distance from the scene of blood,\nThe pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:\nTheir godlike master slain before their eyes,\nThey wept, and shared in human miseries.[248]\nIn vain Automedon now shakes the rein,\nNow plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;\nNor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,\nRestive they stood, and obstinate in woe:\nStill as a tombstone, never to be moved,\nOn some good man or woman unreproved\nLays its eternal weight; or fix'd, as stands\nA marble courser by the sculptor's hands,\nPlaced on the hero's grave. Along their face\nThe big round drops coursed down with silent pace,\nConglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late\nCircled their arched necks, and waved in state,\nTrail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,\nAnd prone to earth was hung their languid head:\nNor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,\nWhile thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:\n\"Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,\nExempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;\nDid we your race on mortal man bestow,\nOnly, alas! to share in mortal woe?\nFor ah! what is there of inferior birth,\nThat breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;\nWhat wretched creature of what wretched kind,\nThan man more weak, calamitous, and blind?\nA miserable race! but cease to mourn:\nFor not by you shall Priam's son be borne\nHigh on the splendid car: one glorious prize\nHe rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.\nOurself will swiftness to your nerves impart,\nOurself with rising spirits swell your heart.\nAutomedon your rapid flight shall bear\nSafe to the navy through the storm of war.\nFor yet 'tis given to Troy to ravage o'er\nThe field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;\nThe sun shall see her conquer, till his fall\nWith sacred darkness shades the face of all.\"\nHe said; and breathing in the immortal horse\nExcessive spirit, urged them to the course;\nFrom their high manes they shake the dust, and bear\nThe kindling chariot through the parted war:\nSo flies a vulture through the clamorous train\nOf geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.\nFrom danger now with swiftest speed they flew,\nAnd now to conquest with like speed pursue;\nSole in the seat the charioteer remains,\nNow plies the javelin, now directs the reins:\nHim brave Alcimedon beheld distress'd,\nApproach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd:\n\"What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,\nAlone, unaided, in the thickest war?\nAlas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields\nAchilles' arms triumphant in the fields.\"\n\"In happy time (the charioteer replies)\nThe bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;\nNo Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,\nOr holds their fury in suspended reins:\nPatroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,\nBut now Patroclus is an empty name!\nTo thee I yield the seat, to thee resign\nThe ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.\"\nHe said. Alcimedon, with active heat,\nSnatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.\nHis friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,\nAnd call'd \u00c6neas fighting near his side.\n\"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,\nAchilles' car, deserted of its lord!\nThe glorious steeds our ready arms invite,\nScarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.\nCan such opponents stand when we assail?\nUnite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.\"\nThe son of Venus to the counsel yields;\nThen o'er their backs they spread their solid shields:\nWith brass refulgent the broad surface shined,\nAnd thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.\nThem Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;\nEach hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:\nIn vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,\nIn vain advance! not fated to return.\nUnmov'd, Automedon attends the fight,\nImplores the Eternal, and collects his might.\nThen turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:\n\"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!\nFull on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,\nFor hard the fight, determined is the foe;\n'Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,\nWar knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.\"\nThen through the field he sends his voice aloud,\nAnd calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,\nWith great Atrides. \"Hither turn, (he said,)\nTurn where distress demands immediate aid;\nThe dead, encircled by his friends, forego,\nAnd save the living from a fiercer foe.\nUnhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage\nThe force of Hector, and \u00c6neas' rage:\nYet mighty as they are, my force to prove\nIs only mine: the event belongs to Jove.\"\nHe spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,\nWhich pass'd the shield of Aretus the young:\nIt pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,\nThen in the lower belly struck the dart.\nAs when a ponderous axe, descending full,\nCleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:[249]\nStruck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,\nThen tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:\nThus fell the youth; the air his soul received,\nAnd the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.\nNow at Automedon the Trojan foe\nDischarged his lance; the meditated blow,\nStooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,\nAnd hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;\nDeep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear\nIn long vibrations spent its fury there.\nWith clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,\nBut each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;\nNor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,\nBut left their slain companion in his blood:\nHis arms Automedon divests, and cries,\n\"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:\nThus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,\nPoor as it is, some offering to thy shade.\"\nSo looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,\nAll grim with rage, and horrible with gore;\nHigh on the chariot at one bound he sprung,\nAnd o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.\nAnd now Minerva from the realms of air\nDescends impetuous, and renews the war;\nFor, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,\nThe lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.\nAs when high Jove denouncing future woe,\nO'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,\n(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,\nOr from the rage of man, destructive war,)\nThe drooping cattle dread the impending skies,\nAnd from his half-till'd field the labourer flies:\nIn such a form the goddess round her drew\nA livid cloud, and to the battle flew.\nAssuming Ph\u0153nix' shape on earth she falls,\nAnd in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:\n\"And lies Achilles' friend, beloved by all,\nA prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?\nWhat shame 'o Greece for future times to tell,\nTo thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!\"\n\"O chief, O father! (Atreus' son replies)\nO full of days! by long experience wise!\nWhat more desires my soul, than here unmoved\nTo guard the body of the man I loved?\nAh, would Minerva send me strength to rear\nThis wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!\nBut Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,\nAnd Jove's own glories blaze around his head!\"\nPleased to be first of all the powers address'd,\nShe breathes new vigour in her hero's breast,\nAnd fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,\nDesire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.\nSo burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o'er),\nRepulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;\n(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings\nUntamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.\nFired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,\nAnd sent his soul with every lance he threw.\nThere stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,\nA\u00ebtion's son, and Podes was his name:\nWith riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd,\nBy Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;\nThrough his broad belt the spear a passage found,\nAnd, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.\nSudden at Hector's side Apollo stood,\nLike Phaenops, Asius' son, appear'd the god;\n(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign\nIn fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)\n\"Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!\nWhat Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?\nDost thou at length to Menelaus yield,\nA chief once thought no terror of the field?\nYet singly, now, the long-disputed prize\nHe bears victorious, while our army flies:\nBy the same arm illustrious Podes bled;\nThe friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!\"\nThis heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,\nRage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.\nBut now the Eternal shook his sable shield,\nThat shaded Ide and all the subject field\nBeneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud\nInvolved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud;\nThe affrighted hills from their foundations nod,\nAnd blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:\nAt one regard of his all-seeing eye\nThe vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.\nThen trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;\nFor as the brave B\u0153otian turn'd his head\nTo face the foe, Polydamas drew near,\nAnd razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear:\nBy Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,\nPierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,\nGrasps his once formidable lance in vain.\nAs Hector follow'd, Idomen address'd\nThe flaming javelin to his manly breast;\nThe brittle point before his corslet yields;\nExulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:\nHigh on his chariots the Cretan stood,\nThe son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.\nBut erring from its aim, the impetuous spear\nStruck to the dust the squire and charioteer\nOf martial Merion: Coeranus his name,\nWho left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.\nOn foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,\nHad graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,\nBut the brave squire the ready coursers brought,\nAnd with his life his master's safety bought.\nBetween his cheek and ear the weapon went,\nThe teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.\nProne from the seat he tumbles to the plain;\nHis dying hand forgets the falling rein:\nThis Merion reaches, bending from the car,\nAnd urges to desert the hopeless war:\nIdomeneus consents; the lash applies;\nAnd the swift chariot to the navy flies.\nNot Ajax less the will of heaven descried,\nAnd conquest shifting to the Trojan side,\nTurn'd by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,\nTo Atreus's seed, the godlike Telamon:\n\"Alas! who sees not Jove's almighty hand\nTransfers the glory to the Trojan band?\nWhether the weak or strong discharge the dart,\nHe guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:\nNot so our spears; incessant though they rain,\nHe suffers every lance to fall in vain.\nDeserted of the god, yet let us try\nWhat human strength and prudence can supply;\nIf yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,\nMay glad the fleets that hope not our return,\nWho tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,\nAnd still hear Hector thundering at their gates.\nSome hero too must be despatch'd to bear\nThe mournful message to Pelides' ear;\nFor sure he knows not, distant on the shore,\nHis friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.\nBut such a chief I spy not through the host:\nThe men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost\nIn general darkness\u2014Lord of earth and air!\nOh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:\nDispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;\nGive me to see, and Ajax asks no more:\nIf Greece must perish, we thy will obey,\nBut let us perish in the face of day!\"\nWith tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer\nThe god relenting clear'd the clouded air;\nForth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;\nThe blaze of armour flash'd against the day.\n\"Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;\nIf yet Antilochus survives the fight,\nLet him to great Achilles' ear convey\nThe fatal news\"\u2014Atrides hastes away.\nSo turns the lion from the nightly fold,\nThough high in courage, and with hunger bold,\nLong gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,\nStiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;\nThe darts fly round him from a hundred hands,\nAnd the red terrors of the blazing brands:\nTill late, reluctant, at the dawn of day\nSour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,\nSo moved Atrides from his dangerous place\nWith weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;\nThe foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain,\nAnd much admonish'd, much adjured his train:\n\"O guard these relics to your charge consign'd,\nAnd bear the merits of the dead in mind;\nHow skill'd he was in each obliging art;\nThe mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:\nHe was, alas! but fate decreed his end,\nIn death a hero, as in life a friend!\"\nSo parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,\nAnd round on all sides sent his piercing view.\nAs the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye\nOf all that wings the mid a\u00ebrial sky,\nThe sacred eagle, from his walks above\nLooks down, and sees the distant thicket move;\nThen stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,\nSnatches his life amid the clouds of air.\nNot with less quickness, his exerted sight\nPass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight:\nTill on the left the chief he sought, he found,\nCheering his men, and spreading deaths around:\nTo him the king: \"Beloved of Jove! draw near,\nFor sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear;\nThy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn!\nHow Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.\nThis is not all: Patroclus, on the shore\nNow pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.\nFly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell\nThe sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:\nHe too may haste the naked corse to gain:\nThe arms are Hector's, who despoil'd the slain.\"\nThe youthful warrior heard with silent woe,\nFrom his fair eyes the tears began to flow:\nBig with the mighty grief, he strove to say\nWhat sorrow dictates, but no word found way.\nTo brave Laodocus his arms he flung,\nWho, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;\nThen ran the mournful message to impart,\nWith tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.\nSwift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands\n(Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands;\nBut bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;\nHimself returns to his Patroclus slain.\n\"Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);\nBut hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid:\nThough fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,\nUnarm'd, he fights not with the Trojan foe.\n'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,\n'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,\nAnd save ourselves, while with impetuous hate\nTroy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.\"\n\"'Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,\nWith Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear;\nMyself, and my bold brother will sustain\nThe shock of Hector and his charging train:\nNor fear we armies, fighting side by side;\nWhat Troy can dare, we have already tried,\nHave tried it, and have stood.\" The hero said.\nHigh from the ground the warriors heave the dead.\nA general clamour rises at the sight:\nLoud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.\nNot fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,\nWith rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,\nVoracious hounds, that many a length before\nTheir furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;\nBut if the savage turns his glaring eye,\nThey howl aloof, and round the forest fly.\nThus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,\nWave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:\nBut Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,\nAll pale they tremble and forsake the field.\nWhile thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,\nBehind them rages all the storm of war:\nConfusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng\nOf men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:\nLess fierce the winds with rising flames conspire\nTo whelm some city under waves of fire;\nNow sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,\nNow crack the blazing temples of the gods;\nThe rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,\nAnd sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.\nThe heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load:\nAs when two mules, along the rugged road,\nFrom the steep mountain with exerted strength\nDrag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length;\nInly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,\nThe enormous timber lumbering down the hill:\nSo these\u2014Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,\nAnd breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.\nThus when a river swell'd with sudden rains\nSpreads his broad waters o'er the level plains,\nSome interposing hill the stream divides,\nAnd breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.\nStill close they follow, close the rear engage;\n\u00c6neas storms, and Hector foams with rage:\nWhile Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,\nWedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,\nThat shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung\nHigh on poised pinions, threats their callow young.\nSo from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,\nSuch the wild terror, and the mingled cry:\nWithin, without the trench, and all the way,\nStrow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;\nSuch horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds\nThe work of death, and still the battle bleeds.\n[Illustration: ] VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM",

her soft hand she press'd,\nAnd, smiling, thus the watery queen address'd:\n\"What, goddess! this unusual favour draws?\nAll hail, and welcome! whatsoe'er the cause;\nTill now a stranger, in a happy hour\nApproach, and taste the dainties of the bower.\"\n[Illustration: ] THETIS AND EURYNOME RECEIVING THE INFANT VULCAN\nHigh on a throne, with stars of silver graced,\nAnd various artifice, the queen she placed;\nA footstool at her feet: then calling, said,\n\"Vulcan, draw near, 'tis Thetis asks your aid.\"\n\"Thetis (replied the god) our powers may claim,\nAn ever-dear, an ever-honour'd name!\nWhen my proud mother hurl'd me from the sky,\n(My awkward form, it seems, displeased her eye,)\nShe, and Eurynome, my griefs redress'd,\nAnd soft received me on their silver breast.\nEven then these arts employ'd my infant thought:\nChains, bracelets, pendants, all their toys, I wrought.\nNine years kept secret in the dark abode,\nSecure I lay, conceal'd from man and god:\nDeep in a cavern'd rock my days were led;\nThe rushing ocean murmur'd o'er my head.\nNow, since her presence glads our mansion, say,\nFor such desert what service can I pay?\nVouchsafe, O Thetis! at our board to share\nThe genial rites, and hospitable fare;\nWhile I the labours of the forge forego,\nAnd bid the roaring bellows cease to blow.\"\nThen from his anvil the lame artist rose;\nWide with distorted legs oblique he goes,\nAnd stills the bellows, and (in order laid)\nLocks in their chests his instruments of trade.\nThen with a sponge the sooty workman dress'd\nHis brawny arms embrown'd, and hairy breast.\nWith his huge sceptre graced, and red attire,\nCame halting forth the sovereign of the fire:\nThe monarch's steps two female forms uphold,\nThat moved and breathed in animated gold;\nTo whom was voice, and sense, and science given\nOf works divine (such wonders are in heaven!)\nOn these supported, with unequal gait,\nHe reach'd the throne where pensive Thetis sate;\nThere placed beside her on the shining frame,\nHe thus address'd the silver-footed dame:\n\"Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls\n(So long a stranger) to these honour'd walls?\n'Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay,\nAnd Vulcan's joy and duty to obey.\"\n[Illustration: ] VULCAN AND CHARIS RECEIVING THETIS\nTo whom the mournful mother thus replies:\n(The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:)\n\"O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine\nSo pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine?\nOf all the goddesses, did Jove prepare\nFor Thetis only such a weight of care?\nI, only I, of all the watery race\nBy force subjected to a man's embrace,\nWho, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays\nThe mighty fine imposed on length of days.\nSprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,\nThe bravest sure that ever bore the name;\nLike some fair plant beneath my careful hand\nHe grew, he flourish'd, and adorn'd the land!\nTo Troy I sent him! but his native shore\nNever, ah never, shall receive him more;\n(Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;)\nNor I, a goddess, can retard the blow!\nRobb'd of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave,\nThe king of nations forced his royal slave:\nFor this he grieved;

and where the furnace burn'd,\nResounding breathed: at once the blast expires,\nAnd twenty forges catch at once the fires;\nJust as the god directs, now loud, now low,\nThey raise a tempest, or they gently blow;\nIn hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,\nAnd stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;\nBefore, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand;\nThe ponderous hammer loads his better hand,\nHis left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round,\nAnd thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.\nThen first he form'd the immense and solid shield;\nRich various artifice emblazed the field;\nIts utmost verge a threefold circle bound;[253]\nA silver chain suspends the massy round;\nFive ample plates the broad expanse compose,\nAnd godlike labours on the surface rose.\nThere shone the image of the master-mind:\nThere earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd;\nThe unwearied sun, the moon completely round;\nThe starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd;\nThe Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team;\nAnd great Orion's more refulgent beam;\nTo which, around the axle of the sky,\nThe Bear, revolving, points his golden eye,\nStill shines exalted on the ethereal plain,\nNor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.\nTwo cities radiant on the shield appear,\nThe image one of peace, and one of war.\nHere sacred pomp and genial feast delight,\nAnd solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;\nAlong the street the new-made brides are led,\nWith torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:\nThe youthful dancers in a circle bound\nTo the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound:\nThrough the fair streets the matrons in a row\nStand in their porches, and enjoy the show.\nThere in the forum swarm a numerous train;\nThe subject of debate, a townsman slain:\nOne pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,\nAnd bade the public and the laws decide:\nThe witness is produced on either hand:\nFor this, or that, the partial people stand:\nThe appointed heralds still the noisy bands,\nAnd form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:\nOn seats of stone, within the sacred place,[254]\nThe reverend elders nodded o'er the case;\nAlternate, each the attesting sceptre took,\nAnd rising solemn, each his sentence spoke.\nTwo golden talents lay amidst, in sight,\nThe prize of him who best adjudged the right.\nAnother part (a prospect differing far)[255]\nGlow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.\nTwo mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace,\nAnd one would pillage, one would burn the place.\nMeantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care,\nA secret ambush on the foe prepare:\nTheir wives, their children, and the watchful band\nOf trembling parents, on the turrets stand.\nThey march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:\nGold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,\nAnd gold their armour: these the squadron led,\nAugust, divine, superior by the head!\nA place for ambush fit they found, and stood,\nCover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.\nTwo spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem\nIf sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.\nSoon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,\nAnd steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;\nBehind them piping on their reeds they go,\nNor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.\nIn arms the glittering squadron rising round\nRush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;\nWhole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,\nAnd, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!\nThe bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;\nThey rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,\nThey fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;\nThe waving silver seem'd to blush with blood.\nThere Tumult, there Contention stood confess'd;\nOne rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast;\nOne held a living foe, that freshly bled\nWith new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead;\nNow here, now there, the carcases they tore:\nFate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.\nAnd the whole war came out, and met the eye;\nAnd each bold figure seem'd to live or die.\nA field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,[256]\nThe third time labour'd by the sweating hind;\nThe shining shares full many ploughmen guide,\nAnd turn their crooked yokes on every side.\nStill as at either end they wheel around,\nThe master meets them with his goblet crown'd;\nThe hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,\nThen back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:\nBehind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;\nAnd sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.\nAnother field rose high with waving grain;\nWith bended sickles stand the reaper train:\nHere stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,\nSheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.\nWith sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;\nThe gatherers follow, and collect in bands;\nAnd last the children, in whose arms are borne\n(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.\nThe rustic monarch of the field descries,\nWith silent glee, the heaps around him rise.\nA ready banquet on the turf is laid,\nBeneath an ample oak's expanded shade.\nThe victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;\nThe reaper's due repast, the woman's care.\nNext, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,\nBent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;\nA deeper dye the dangling clusters show,\nAnd curl'd on silver props, in order glow:\nA darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;\nAnd pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.\nTo this, one pathway gently winding leads,\nWhere march a train with baskets on their heads,\n(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear\nThe purple product of the autumnal year.\nTo these a youth awakes the warbling strings,\nWhose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;\nIn measured dance behind him move the train,\nTune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.\nHere herds of oxen march, erect and bold,\nRear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,\nAnd speed to meadows on whose sounding shores\nA rapid torrent through the rushes roars:\nFour golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,\nAnd nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.\nTwo lions rushing from the wood appear'd;\nAnd seized a bull, the master of the herd:\nHe roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;\nThey tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.\nThe dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,\nDread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.\nNext this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads\nDeep through fair forests, and a length of meads,\nAnd stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;\nAnd fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.\nA figured dance succeeds; such once was seen\nIn lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,\nForm'd by Daedalean art; a comely band\nOf youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.\nThe maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;\nThe youths all graceful in the glossy vest:\nOf those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;\nOf these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,\nThat glittering gay, from silver belts depend.\nNow all at once they rise, at once descend,\nWith well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,\nConfusedly regular, the moving maze:\nNow forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,\nAnd undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:\nSo whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,\nAnd, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.\nThe gazing multitudes admire around:\nTwo active tumblers in the centre bound;\nNow high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:\nAnd general songs the sprightly revel end.\nThus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd\nWith his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:\nIn living silver seem'd the waves to roll,\nAnd beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.\nThis done, whate'er a warrior's use requires\nHe forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,\nThe greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd\nWith various sculpture, and the golden crest.\nAt Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:\nShe, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,\nSwift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,",

then Agamemnon rose:\nThe boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord\nDrew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword:\nThe stubborn bristles from the victim's brow\nHe crops, and offering meditates his vow.\nHis hands uplifted to the attesting skies,\nOn heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.\nThe solemn words a deep attention draw,\nAnd Greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.\n\"Witness thou first! thou greatest power above,\nAll-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!\nAnd mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,\nAnd ye, fell furies of the realms of night,\nWho rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare\nFor perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!\nThe black-eyed maid inviolate removes,\nPure and unconscious of my manly loves.\nIf this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,\nAnd levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!\"\nWith that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;\nThe bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;\nThe sacred herald rolls the victim slain\n(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.\nThen thus Achilles: \"Hear, ye Greeks! and know\nWhate'er we feel, 'tis Jove inflicts the woe;\nNot else Atrides could our rage inflame,\nNor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.\n'Twas Jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,\nThat doom'd our strife, and doom'd the Greeks to fall.\nGo then, ye chiefs!

of Podarges' strain,\n(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)\nBe swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,\nAnd learn to make your master more your care:\nThrough falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,\nNor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord.\"\nThe generous Xanthus, as the words he said,\nSeem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:\nTrembling he stood before the golden wain,\nAnd bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.\nWhen, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke\nEternal silence, and portentous spoke.\n\"Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear\nThy rage in safety through the files of war:\nBut come it will, the fatal time must come,\nNot ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.\nNot through our crime, or slowness in the course,\nFell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;\nThe bright far-shooting god who gilds the day\n(Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms away.\nNo\u2014could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,\nOr beat the pinions of the western gale,\nAll were in vain\u2014the Fates thy death demand,\nDue to a mortal and immortal hand.\"\nThen ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,\nHis fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied\nWith unabated rage\u2014\"So let it be!\nPortents and prodigies are lost on me.\nI know my fate: to die, to see no more\nMy much-loved parents, and my native shore\u2014\nEnough\u2014when heaven ordains, I sink in night:\nNow perish Troy!\" He said, and rush'd to fight.",

Celestial powers! descend,\nAnd as your minds direct, your succour lend\nTo either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,\nIf uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:\nTheir troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;\nWhat can they now, if in his rage he rise?\nAssist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall\nMay fall this day, though fate forbids the fall.\"",

Such the lion's rage,\nWho viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,\nThough all in arms the peopled city rise,\nStalks careless on, with unregarding pride;\nTill at the length, by some brave youth defied,\nTo his bold spear the savage turns alone,\nHe murmurs fury with a hollow groan;\nHe grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,\nLash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;\nHe calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,\nResolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.\nSo fierce Achilles on \u00c6neas flies;\nSo stands \u00c6neas, and his force defies.\nEre yet the stern encounter join'd, begun\nThe seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:\n\"Why comes \u00c6neas through the ranks so far?\nSeeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,\nIn hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,\nAnd prove his merits to the throne of Troy?\nGrant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,\nThe partial monarch may refuse the prize;\nSons he has many; those thy pride may quell:\nAnd 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,\nOr, in reward of thy victorious hand,\nHas Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,\nAn ample forest, or a fair domain,\nOf hills for vines, and arable for grain?\nEven this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.\nBut can Achilles be so soon forgot?\nOnce (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear,\nAnd then the great \u00c6neas seem'd to fear:\nWith hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,\nNor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.\nHer lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;\nThose, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:\nIn Grecian chains her captive race were cast;\n'Tis true, the great \u00c6neas fled too fast.\nDefrauded of my conquest once before,\nWhat then I lost, the gods this day restore.\nGo; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\"\nTo this Anchises' son: \"Such words employ\nTo one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;\nSuch we disdain; the best may be defied\nWith mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;\nUnworthy the high race from which we came\nProclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame:\nEach from illustrious fathers draws his line;\nEach goddess-born; half human, half divine.\nThetis' this day, or Venus' offspring dies,\nAnd tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:\nFor when two heroes, thus derived, contend,\n'Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.\nIf yet thou further seek to learn my birth\n(A tale resounded through the spacious earth)\nHear how the glorious origin we prove\nFrom ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:\nDardania's walls he raised; for Ilion, then,\n(The city since of many-languaged men,)\nWas not. The natives were content to till\nThe shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.[264]\nFrom Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,\nThe richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;\nThree thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,\nThree thousand foals beside their mothers fed.\nBoreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,\nConceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,\nWith voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,\nAnd coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:\nHence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,\nSwift as their mother mares, and father wind.\nThese lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,\nNor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;\nAnd when along the level seas they flew,[265]\nScarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.\nSuch Erichthonius was: from him there came\nThe sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.\nThree sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,\nIlus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:\nThe matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,\nWhom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,\nTo bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,\nThe grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).\nThe two remaining sons the line divide:\nFirst rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;\nFrom him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,\nAnd Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;\nClytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;\nAnd Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.\nFrom great Assaracus sprang Capys, he\nBegat Anchises, and Anchises me.\nSuch is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,\nBut Jove alone endues the soul with worth:\nHe, source of power and might! with boundless sway,\nAll human courage gives, or takes away.\nLong in the field of words we may contend,\nReproach is infinite, and knows no end,\nArm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;\nSo voluble a weapon is the tongue;\nWounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,\nFor every man has equal strength to rail:\nWomen alone, when in the streets they jar,\nPerhaps excel us in this wordy war;\nLike us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,\nAnd vent their anger impotent and loud.\nCease then\u2014Our business in the field of fight\nIs not to question, but to prove our might.\nTo all those insults thou hast offer'd here,\nReceive this answer: 'tis my flying spear.\"\nHe spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,\nFix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.\nFar on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held\n(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,\nThat trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear\nSaw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.\nHis fears were vain; impenetrable charms\nSecured the temper of the ethereal arms.\nThrough two strong plates the point its passage held,\nBut stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.\nFive plates of various metal, various mould,\nComposed the shield; of brass each outward fold,\nOf tin each inward, and the middle gold:\nThere stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,\nThe forceful spear of great Achilles flew,\nAnd pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,\nWhere the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:\nThrough the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,\nAnd the slight covering of expanded hides.\n\u00c6neas his contracted body bends,\nAnd o'er him high the riven targe extends,\nSees, through its parting plates, the upper air,\nAnd at his back perceives the quivering spear:\nA fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;\nAnd swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.\nAchilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,\nDraws his broad blade, and at \u00c6neas flies:\n\u00c6neas rousing as the foe came on,\nWith force collected, heaves a mighty stone:\nA mass enormous! which in modern days\nNo two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.\nBut ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground\nSaw the distress, and moved the powers around:\n\"Lo! on the brink of fate \u00c6neas stands,\nAn instant victim to Achilles' hands;\nBy Ph\u0153bus urged; but Ph\u0153bus has bestow'd\nHis aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.\nAnd can ye see this righteous chief atone\nWith guiltless blood for vices not his own?\nTo all the gods his constant vows were paid;\nSure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.\nFate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign\nThe future father of the Dardan line:[266]\nThe first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,\nAnd still his love descends on all the race:\nFor Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,\nAt length are odious to the all-seeing mind;\nOn great \u00c6neas shall devolve the reign,\nAnd sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.\"\nThe great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies\nThe imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:\n\"Good as he is, to immolate or spare\nThe Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;\nPallas and I, by all that gods can bind,\nHave sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;\nNot even an instant to protract their fate,\nOr save one member of the sinking state;\nTill her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,\nAnd even her crumbling ruins are no more.\"\nThe king of ocean to the fight descends,\nThrough all the whistling darts his course he bends,\nSwift interposed between the warrior flies,\nAnd casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.[267]\nFrom great \u00c6neas' shield the spear he drew,\nAnd at his master's feet the weapon threw.\nThat done, with force divine he snatch'd on high\nThe Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,\nSmooth-gliding without step, above the heads\nOf warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:\nTill at the battle's utmost verge they light,\nWhere the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.\nThe godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)\nWith words like these the panting chief address'd:\n\"What power, O prince! with force inferior far,\nUrged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?\nHenceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,\nDefrauding fate of all thy fame to come.\nBut when the day decreed (for come it must)\nShall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,\nLet then the furies of that arm be known,\nSecure no Grecian force transcends thy own.\"",

(he cries, and every rank alarms)\nJoin battle, man to man, and arms to arms!\n'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,\nTo mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:\nNo god can singly such a host engage,\nNot Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.\nBut whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,\nWhate'er of active force, or acting fire;\nWhate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;\nAll, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.\nThrough yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,\nAnd thin the squadrons with my single spear.\"\nHe said: nor less elate with martial joy,\nThe godlike Hector warm'd the troops of Troy:\n\"Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;\nNor dread the vaunts of Peleus' haughty son.\nDeeds must decide our fate. E'en these with words\nInsult the brave, who tremble at their swords:\nThe weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,\nBut shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.\nNor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,\nNot though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;\nThat fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,\nAnd brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.\"\nThus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;\nA wood of lances rises round his head,\nClamours on clamours tempest all the air,\nThey join, they throng, they thicken to the war.\nBut Ph\u0153bus warns him from high heaven to shun\nThe single fight with Thetis' godlike son;\nMore safe to combat in the mingled band,\nNor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.\nHe hears, obedient to the god of light,\nAnd, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.\nThen fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,\nOn Troy's whole force with boundless fury flies.\nFirst falls Iphytion, at his army's head;\nBrave was the chief, and brave the host he led;\nFrom great Otrynteus he derived his blood,\nHis mother was a Nais, of the flood;\nBeneath the shades of Tmolus, crown'd with snow,\nFrom Hyde's walls he ruled the lands below.\nFierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:\nThe parted visage falls on equal sides:\nWith loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;\nWhile thus Achilles glories o'er the slain:\n\"Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth\nReceives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;\nThose beauteous fields where Hyllus' waves are roll'd,\nAnd plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,\nAre thine no more.\"\u2014The insulting hero said,\nAnd left him sleeping in eternal shade.\nThe rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,\nAnd dash'd their axles with no vulgar gore.\nDemoleon next, Antenor's offspring, laid\nBreathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.\nThe impatient steel with full-descending sway\nForced through his brazen helm its furious way,\nResistless drove the batter'd skull before,\nAnd dash'd and mingled all the brains with gore.\nThis sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,\nDeserts his chariot for a swifter flight:\nThe lance arrests him: an ignoble wound\nThe panting Trojan rivets to the ground.\nHe groans away his soul: not louder roars,\nAt Neptune's shrine on Helic\u00e8's high shores,\nThe victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,\nAnd ocean listens to the grateful sound.\nThen fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,[268]\nThe youngest hope of Priam's stooping age:\n(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass'd:)\nOf all his sons, the dearest, and the last.\nTo the forbidden field he takes his flight,\nIn the first folly of a youthful knight,\nTo vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,\nBut vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:\nStruck where the crossing belts unite behind,\nAnd golden rings the double back-plate join'd\nForth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;\nAnd on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;\nThe rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground\nHis hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.\nWhen Hector view'd, all ghastly in his gore,\nThus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,\nA cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,\nHis soul no longer brook'd the distant fight:\nFull in Achilles' dreadful front he came,\nAnd shook his javelin like a waving flame.\nThe son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd,\nHis heart high-bounding in his rising breast.\n\"And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;\nThe man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!\nNo more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear\nTurn from each other in the walks of war.\"\u2014\nThen with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:\n\"Come, and receive thy fate!\" He spake no more.\nHector, undaunted, thus: \"Such words employ\nTo one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:\nSuch we could give, defying and defied,\nMean intercourse of obloquy and pride!\nI know thy force to mine superior far;\nBut heaven alone confers success in war:\nMean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,\nAnd give it entrance in a braver heart.\"\nThen parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath\nFar from Achilles wafts the winged death:\nThe bidden dart again to Hector flies,\nAnd at the feet of its great master lies.\nAchilles closes with his hated foe,\nHis heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:\nBut present to his aid, Apollo shrouds\nThe favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.\nThrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,\nThrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;\nThe spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.\nHe foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:\n\"Wretch! thou hast 'scaped again; once more thy flight\nHas saved thee, and the partial god of light.\nBut long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,\nIf any power assist Achilles' hand.\nFly then inglorious! but thy flight this day\nWhole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay.\"\nWith that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:\nThen Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,\nPierced through the neck: he left him panting there,\nAnd stopp'd Demuchus, great Philetor's heir.\nGigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade,\nAnd for the soul an ample passage made.\nLaoganus and Dardanus expire,\nThe valiant sons of an unhappy sire;\nBoth in one instant from the chariot hurl'd,\nSunk in one instant to the nether world:\nThis difference only their sad fates afford\nThat one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword.\nNor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;\nIn vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;\nIn vain he begs thee, with a suppliant's moan,\nTo spare a form, an age so like thy own!\nUnhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,\nE'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!\nWhile yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,\nThe ruthless falchion oped his tender side;\nThe panting liver pours a flood of gore\nThat drowns his bosom till he pants no more.\nThrough Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:\nThe warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.\nThy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,\nDeep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;\nWarm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,\nThe purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.\nThen brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung\nWhere the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;\nHe dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,\nAnd stood all impotent, expecting fate:\nFull on his neck the falling falchion sped,\nFrom his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head:\nForth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,\nAnd, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.\nRhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,\n(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)\nSucceeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;\nProne from his car the thundering chief descends.\nThe squire, who saw expiring on the ground\nHis prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;\nHis back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored,\nAnd stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.\nAs when a flame the winding valley fills,\nAnd runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;\nThen o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,\nFires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,\nThis way and that, the spreading torrent roars:\nSo sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;\nAround him wide, immense destruction pours\nAnd earth is deluged with the sanguine showers,\nAs with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,\nAnd thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor;\nWhen round and round, with never-wearied pain,\nThe trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:\nSo the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,\nTread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,\nDash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,\nBlack, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:\nThe spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;\nAnd thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.\nHigh o'er the scene of death Achilles stood,\nAll grim with dust, all horrible in blood:\nYet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;\nSuch is the lust of never-dying fame!\n[Illustration: ] CENTAUR",

With feeble pace,\nAnd settled sorrow on his aged face,\nFast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;\nAnd thus descending, on the guards he calls:\n\"You to whose care our city-gates belong,\nSet wide your portals to the flying throng:\nFor lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;\nHe comes, and desolation marks his way!\nBut when within the walls our troops take breath,\nLock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.\"\nThus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung\nThe opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.\nPh\u0153bus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;\nStruck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,\nOn heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,\nAnd gladsome see their last escape from fate.\nThither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,\nHoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:\nAnd gasping, panting, fainting, labour on\nWith heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.\nEnraged Achilles follows with his spear;\nWild with revenge, insatiable of war.\nThen had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,\nAnd Troy inglorious to her walls retired;\nBut he, the god who darts ethereal flame,\nShot down to save her, and redeem her fame:\nTo young Agenor force divine he gave;\n(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)\nIn aid of him, beside the beech he sate,\nAnd wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.\nWhen now the generous youth Achilles spies,\nThick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.\n(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)\nHe stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;\n\"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!\nLike others fly, and be like others slain?\nVain hope! to shun him by the self-same road\nYon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.\nNo: with the common heap I scorn to fall\u2014\nWhat if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,\nWhile I decline to yonder path, that leads\nTo Ida's forests and surrounding shades?\nSo may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,\nFrom my tired body wash the dirt and blood,\nAs soon as night her dusky veil extends,\nReturn in safety to my Trojan friends.\nWhat if?\u2014But wherefore all this vain debate?\nStand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?\nEven now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,\nThe fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:\nSuch is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,\nAnd such his valour, that who stands must die.\nHowe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,\nHere, and in public view, to meet my fate.\nYet sure he too is mortal; he may feel\n(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.\nOne only soul informs that dreadful frame:\nAnd Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame.\"\nHe said, and stood, collected, in his might;\nAnd all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.\nSo from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,\nRoused from his thicket by a storm of darts:\nUntaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds\nOf shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;\nThough struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;\nAnd the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:\nOn their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;\nAnd tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.\nNot less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir\nConfronts Achilles, and awaits the war,\nDisdainful of retreat: high held before,\nHis shield (a broad circumference) he bore;\nThen graceful as he stood, in act to throw\nThe lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:\n\"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!\nAnd hopes this day to sink the Trojan name\nBeneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;\nA thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.\nParents and children our just arms employ,\nAnd strong and many are the sons of Troy.\nGreat as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore\nThese Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.\"\nHe said: with matchless force the javelin flung\nSmote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung\nBeneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms\nHe stands impassive in the ethereal arms.\nThen fiercely rushing on the daring foe,\nHis lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:\nBut, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds\nThe god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.\nSafe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,\nDismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.\nMeanwhile the god, to cover their escape,\nAssumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,\nFlies from the furious chief in this disguise;\nThe furious chief still follows where he flies.\nNow o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,\nNow urge the course where swift Scamander glides:\nThe god, now distant scarce a stride before,\nTempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;\nWhile all the flying troops their speed employ,\nAnd pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:\nNo stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,\nWho 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.\n'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;\nAnd sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.\nPale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:",

Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain.\nHector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the\nadvance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles\npursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning\nthe fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.\nShe deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and\nis slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of\nPriam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries\nreach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into\nthe inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds\nher dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and\nlamentation.\nThe thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls,\nand on the battlements of Troy.\nThus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,\nThe herded Ilians rush like driven deer:\nThere safe they wipe the briny drops away,\nAnd drown in bowls the labours of the day.\nClose to the walls, advancing o'er the fields\nBeneath one roof of well-compacted shields,\nMarch, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,\nFar stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.\nGreat Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate\nThere fix'd he stood before the Sc\u00e6an gate;\nStill his bold arms determined to employ,\nThe guardian still of long-defended Troy.\nApollo now to tired Achilles turns:\n(The power confess'd in all his glory burns:)\n\"And what (he cries) has Peleus' son in view,\nWith mortal speed a godhead to pursue?\nFor not to thee to know the gods is given,\nUnskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.\nWhat boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?\nVain thy past labour, and thy present vain:\nSafe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,\nWhile here thy frantic rage attacks a god.\"\nThe chief incensed\u2014\"Too partial god of day!\nTo check my conquests in the middle way:\nHow few in Ilion else had refuge found!\nWhat gasping numbers now had bit the ground!\nThou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,\nPowerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:\nMean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,\nTo cheat a mortal who repines in vain.\"\nThen to the city, terrible and strong,\nWith high and haughty steps he tower'd along,\nSo the proud courser, victor of the prize,\nTo the near goal with double ardour flies.\nHim, as he blazing shot across the field,\nThe careful eyes of Priam first beheld.\nNot half so dreadful rises to the sight,[274]\nThrough the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,\nOrion's dog (the year when autumn weighs),\nAnd o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays;\nTerrific glory! for his burning breath\nTaints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.\nSo flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:\nHe strikes his reverend head, now white with age;\nHe lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;\nHe calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:\nThe son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,\nFull at the Sc\u00e6an gates expects the war;\nWhile the sad father on the rampart stands,\nAnd thus adjures him with extended hands:\n\"Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;\nHector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!\nMethinks already I behold thee slain,\nAnd stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.\nImplacable Achilles! might'st thou be\nTo all the gods no dearer than to me!\nThee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,\nAnd bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.\nHow many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,\nValiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:\nOr, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles\nTo shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.\nTwo, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,\nTwo from one mother sprung, my Polydore,\nAnd loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!\nOh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,\nWhat heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!\n(Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,\nConsign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)\nBut if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,\nAll pale they wander on the Stygian coast;\nWhat sorrows then must their sad mother know,\nWhat anguish I? unutterable woe!\nYet less that anguish, less to her, to me,\nLess to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.\nYet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;\nAnd spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!\nSave thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave\nNeglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.\nPity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;\nWhile yet thy father feels the woes he bears,\nYet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage\n(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)\nGreat Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!\nThe bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:\nTo fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,\nAnd number all his days by miseries!\nMy heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,\nMy daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,\nMy bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;\nThese I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!\nPerhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,\nThe last sad relic of my ruin'd state,\n(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,\nAnd stain the pavement of my regal hall;\nWhere famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,\nShall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.\nYet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;\nWell have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.\nWho dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,\nStruck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.\nBut when the fates, in fulness of their rage,\nSpurn the hoar head of unresisting age,\nIn dust the reverend lineaments deform,\nAnd pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:\nThis, this is misery! the last, the worse,\nThat man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!\"\nHe said, and acting what no words could say,\nRent from his head the silver locks away.\nWith him the mournful mother bears a part;\nYet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.\nThe zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;\nAnd thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:\n\"Have mercy on me, O my son! revere\nThe words of age; attend a parent's prayer!\nIf ever thee in these fond arms I press'd,\nOr still'd thy infant clamours at this breast;\nAh do not thus our helpless years forego,\nBut, by our walls secured, repel the foe.\nAgainst his rage if singly thou proceed,\nShould'st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should'st thou bleed,\nNor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,\nNor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!\nFar from our pious rites those dear remains\nMust feast the vultures on the naked plains.\"\nSo they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;\nBut fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;\nResolved he stands, and with a fiery glance\nExpects the hero's terrible advance.\nSo, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake\nBeholds the traveller approach the brake;\nWhen fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins\nHave gather'd half the poisons of the plains;\nHe burns, he stiffens with collected ire,\nAnd his red eyeballs glare with living fire.\nBeneath a turret, on his shield reclined,\nHe stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:[275]\n\"Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?\nHonour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:\nShall proud Polydamas before the gate\nProclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,\nWhich timely follow'd but the former night,\nWhat numbers had been saved by Hector's flight?\nThat wise advice rejected with disdain,\nI feel my folly in my people slain.\nMethinks my suffering country's voice I hear,\nBut most her worthless sons insult my ear,\nOn my rash courage charge the chance of war,\nAnd blame those virtues which they cannot share.\nNo\u2014if I e'er return, return I must\nGlorious, my country's terror laid in dust:\nOr if I perish, let her see me fall\nIn field at least, and fighting for her wall.\nAnd yet suppose these measures I forego,\nApproach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,\nThe warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,\nAnd treat on terms of peace to save the town:\nThe wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd\n(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)\nWith honourable justice to restore:\nAnd add half Ilion's yet remaining store,\nWhich Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece\nMay share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.\nBut why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,\nWhat hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,\nBut woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?\nWe greet not here, as man conversing man,\nMet at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;\nNo season now for calm familiar talk,\nLike youths and maidens in an evening walk:\nWar is our business, but to whom is given\nTo die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!\"\nThus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;\nHis dreadful plumage nodded from on high;\nThe Pelian javelin, in his better hand,\nShot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;\nAnd on his breast the beamy splendour shone,\nLike Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.\nAs Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,\nStruck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.\nHe leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:\nAchilles follows like the winged wind.\nThus at the panting dove a falcon flies\n(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),\nJust when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,\nObliquely wheeling through the aerial way,\nWith open beak and shrilling cries he springs,\nAnd aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:\nNo less fore-right the rapid chase they held,\nOne urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:\nNow circling round the walls their course maintain,\nWhere the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;\nNow where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,\n(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.\nNext by Scamander's double source they bound,\nWhere two famed fountains burst the parted ground;\nThis hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,\nWith exhalations steaming to the skies;\nThat the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,\nLike crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:\nEach gushing fount a marble cistern fills,\nWhose polish'd bed receives the falling rills;\nWhere Trojan dames (ere yet alarm'd by Greece)\nWash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.[276]\nBy these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight:\n(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)\nSwift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,\nNo vulgar victim must reward the day:\n(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)\nThe prize contended was great Hector's life.\nAs when some hero's funerals are decreed\nIn grateful honour of the mighty dead;\nWhere high rewards the vigorous youth inflame\n(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)\nThe panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,\nAnd with them turns the raised spectator's soul:\nThus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.\nThe gazing gods lean forward from the sky;\nTo whom, while eager on the chase they look,\nThe sire of mortals and immortals spoke:\n\"Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,\nBehold, inglorious round yon city driven!\nMy heart partakes the generous Hector's pain;\nHector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,\nWhose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,\nFrom Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy:\nNow see him flying; to his fears resign'd,\nAnd fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.\nConsult, ye powers! ('tis worthy your debate)\nWhether to snatch him from impending fate,\nOr let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,\n(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man.\"\nThen Pallas thus: \"Shall he whose vengeance forms\nThe forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,\nShall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath?\nA man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death!\nAnd will no murmurs fill the courts above?\nNo gods indignant blame their partial Jove?\"\n\"Go then (return'd the sire) without delay,\nExert thy will: I give the Fates their way.\"\nSwift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,\nAnd stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.\nAs through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,\nThe well-breath'd beagle drives the flying fawn,\nIn vain he tries the covert of the brakes,\nOr deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;\nSure of the vapour in the tainted dews,\nThe certain hound his various maze pursues.\nThus step by step, where'er the Trojan wheel'd,\nThere swift Achilles compass'd round the field.\nOft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,\nAnd hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,\n(Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,\nFrom the high turrets might oppress the foe,)\nSo oft Achilles turns him to the plain:\nHe eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.\nAs men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,\nOne to pursue, and one to lead the chase,\nTheir sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,\nNor this can fly, nor that can overtake:\nNo less the labouring heroes pant and strain:\nWhile that but flies, and this pursues in vain.\nWhat god, O muse, assisted Hector's force\nWith fate itself so long to hold the course?\nPh\u0153bus it was; who, in his latest hour,\nEndued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:\nAnd great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance\nShould snatch the glory from his lifted lance,\nSign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,\nAnd leave untouch'd the honours of the day.\nJove lifts the golden balances, that show\nThe fates of mortal men, and things below:\nHere each contending hero's lot he tries,\nAnd weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.\nLow sinks the scale surcharged with Hector's fate;\nHeavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.\nThen Ph\u0153bus left him. Fierce Minerva flies\nTo stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:\n\"O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,\nAnd conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.\nGreat Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,\nDrunk with renown, insatiable of war,\nFalls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,\nShall more avail him, nor his god of light.\nSee, where in vain he supplicates above,\nRoll'd at the feet of unrelenting Jove;\nRest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,\nAnd urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.\"\nHer voice divine the chief with joyful mind\nObey'd; and rested, on his lance reclined\nWhile like Deiphobus the martial dame\n(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),\nIn show an aid, by hapless Hector's side\nApproach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:\n\"Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight\nOf this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:\nIt fits us now a noble stand to make,\nAnd here, as brothers, equal fates partake.\"\nThen he: \"O prince! allied in blood and fame,\nDearer than all that own a brother's name;\nOf all that Hecuba to Priam bore,\nLong tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!\nSince you, of all our numerous race alone\nDefend my life, regardless of your own.\"\nAgain the goddess: \"Much my father's prayer,\nAnd much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:\nMy friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,\nBut stronger love impell'd, and I obey.\nCome then, the glorious conflict let us try,\nLet the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;\nOr let us stretch Achilles on the field,\nOr to his arm our bloody trophies yield.\"\nFraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:\nThe Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.\nSternly they met. The silence Hector broke:\nHis dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:\n\"Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd\nHer walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.\nBut now some god within me bids me try\nThine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.\nYet on the verge of battle let us stay,\nAnd for a moment's space suspend the day;\nLet Heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate\nThe just conditions of this stern debate,\n(Eternal witnesses of all below,\nAnd faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)\nTo them I swear; if, victor in the strife,\nJove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,\nNo vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;\nStripp'd of its arms alone (the conqueror's due)\nThe rest to Greece uninjured I'll restore:\nNow plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more.\"\n\"Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,\nWhile anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes),\nDetested as thou art, and ought to be,\nNor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:\nSuch pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,\nSuch leagues as men and furious lions join,\nTo such I call the gods! one constant state\nOf lasting rancour and eternal hate:\nNo thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,\nTill death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.\nRouse then thy forces this important hour,\nCollect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.\nNo further subterfuge, no further chance;\n'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.\nEach Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,\nNow hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.\"\nHe spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;\nBut Hector shunn'd the meditated blow:\nHe stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear\nSang innocent, and spent its force in air.\nMinerva watch'd it falling on the land,\nThen drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand,\nUnseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,\nNow shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.\n\"The life you boasted to that javelin given,\nPrince! you have miss'd. My fate depends on Heaven,\nTo thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,\nOr what must prove my fortune, or thy own.\nBoasting is but an art, our fears to blind,\nAnd with false terrors sink another's mind.\nBut know, whatever fate I am to try,\nBy no dishonest wound shall Hector die.\nI shall not fall a fugitive at least,\nMy soul shall bravely issue from my breast.\nBut first, try thou my arm; and may this dart\nEnd all my country's woes, deep buried in thy heart.\"\nThe weapon flew, its course unerring held,\nUnerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd\nThe mortal dart; resulting with a bound\nFrom off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.\nHector beheld his javelin fall in vain,\nNor other lance, nor other hope remain;\nHe calls Deiphobus, demands a spear\u2014\nIn vain, for no Deiphobus was there.\nAll comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;\n\"'Tis so\u2014Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!\nI deem'd Deiphobus had heard my call,\nBut he secure lies guarded in the wall.\nA god deceived me; Pallas, 'twas thy deed,\nDeath and black fate approach!

Then welcome fate!\n'Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:\nYet in a mighty deed I shall expire,\nLet future ages hear it, and admire!\"\nFierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,\nAnd, all collected, on Achilles flew.\nSo Jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air,\nStoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.\nNor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:\nBefore his breast the flaming shield he bears,\nRefulgent orb! above his fourfold cone\nThe gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.\nNodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)\nAnd as he moved, his figure seem'd on flame.\nAs radiant Hesper shines with keener light,[277]\nFar-beaming o'er the silver host of night,\nWhen all the starry train emblaze the sphere:\nSo shone the point of great Achilles' spear.\nIn his right hand he waves the weapon round,\nEyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;\nBut the rich mail Patroclus lately wore\nSecurely cased the warrior's body o'er.\nOne space at length he spies, to let in fate,\nWhere 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate\nGave entrance: through that penetrable part\nFurious he drove the well-directed dart:\nNor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power\nOf speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.\nProne on the field the bleeding warrior lies,\nWhile, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:\n\"At last is Hector stretch'd upon the plain,\nWho fear'd no vengeance for Patroclus slain:\nThen, prince! you should have fear'd, what now you feel;\nAchilles absent was Achilles still:\nYet a short space the great avenger stayed,\nThen low in dust thy strength and glory laid.\nPeaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn'd,\nFor ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd:\nWhile cast to all the rage of hostile power,\nThee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour.\"\nThen Hector, fainting at the approach of death:\n\"By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!\nBy all the sacred prevalence of prayer;\nAh, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!\nThe common rites of sepulture bestow,\nTo soothe a father's and a mother's woe:\nLet their large gifts procure an urn at least,\nAnd Hector's ashes in his country rest.\"\n\"No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;\n(Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)\nNot those who gave me breath should bid me spare,\nNor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.\nCould I myself the bloody banquet join!\nNo\u2014to the dogs that carcase I resign.\nShould Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,\nAnd giving thousands, offer thousands more;\nShould Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,\nDrain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:\nTheir Hector on the pile they should not see,\nNor rob the vultures of one limb of thee.\"\nThen thus the chief his dying accents drew:\n\"Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:\nThe Furies that relentless breast have steel'd,\nAnd cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.\nYet think, a day will come, when fate's decree\nAnd angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;\nPh\u0153bus and Paris shall avenge my fate,\nAnd stretch thee here before the Sc\u00e6an gate.\"[278]\nHe ceased. The Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,\nAnd his eyes stiffen'd at the hand of death;\nTo the dark realm the spirit wings its way,\n(The manly body left a load of clay,)\nAnd plaintive glides along the dreary coast,\nA naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!\nAchilles, musing as he roll'd his eyes\nO'er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:\n\"Die thou the first!

train;\nThen clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;\nNext these the melancholy band appear;\nAmidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;\nO'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;\nAchilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,\nSupporting with his hands the hero's head,\nBends o'er the extended body of the dead.\nPatroclus decent on the appointed ground\nThey place, and heap the sylvan pile around.\nBut great Achilles stands apart in prayer,\nAnd from his head divides the yellow hair;\nThose curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,[287]\nAnd sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:\nThen sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,\nAnd roll'd his eyes around the watery waste:\n\"Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost\nDelightful roll along my native coast!\nTo whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,\nThese locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:\nFull fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,\nWhere to the day thy silver fountains rise,\nAnd where in shade of consecrated bowers\nThy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!\nSo vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain;\nNo more Achilles sees his native plain;\nIn that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,\nPatroclus bears them to the shades below.\"\nThus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd,\nOn his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.\nOnce more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:\nAnd now the sun had set upon their woe;\nBut to the king of men thus spoke the chief:\n\"Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:\nPermit the mourning legions to retire,\nAnd let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;\nThe pious care be ours, the dead to burn\u2014\"\nHe said: the people to their ships return:\nWhile those deputed to inter the slain\nHeap with a rising pyramid the plain.[288]\nA hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,\nThe growing structure spreads on every side;\nHigh on the top the manly corse they lay,\nAnd well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:\nAchilles covered with their fat the dead,\nAnd the piled victims round the body spread;\nThen jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,\nSuspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.\nFour sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan\nPour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.\nOf nine large dogs, domestic at his board,\nFall two, selected to attend their lord,\nThen last of all, and horrible to tell,\nSad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.[289]\nOn these the rage of fire victorious preys,\nInvolves and joins them in one common blaze.\nSmear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,\nAnd calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:[290]\n\"All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost\nHear, and exult, on Pluto's dreary coast.\nBehold Achilles' promise fully paid,\nTwelve Trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade;\nBut heavier fates on Hector's corse attend,\nSaved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.\"\nSo spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain\nHis threat, and guard inviolate the slain:\nCelestial Venus hover'd o'er his head,\nAnd roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:\nShe watch'd him all the night and all the day,\nAnd drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.\nNor sacred Ph\u0153bus less employ'd his care;\nHe pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,\nAnd kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,\nAgainst the solar beam and Sirian fire.\n[Illustration: ] THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS\nNor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,\nSmokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;\nBut, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,\nInvoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,\nAnd victims promised, and libations cast,\nTo gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:\nHe call'd the aerial powers, along the skies\nTo breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.\nThe winged Iris heard the hero's call,\nAnd instant hasten'd to their airy hall,\nWhere in old Zephyr's open courts on high,\nSat all the blustering brethren of the sky.\nShe shone amidst them, on her painted bow;\nThe rocky pavement glitter'd with the show.\nAll from the banquet rise, and each invites\nThe various goddess to partake the rites.\n\"Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go\nTo sacred Ocean, and the floods below:\nEven now our solemn hecatombs attend,\nAnd heaven is feasting on the world's green end\nWith righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)\nFar on the extremest limits of the main.\nBut Peleus' son entreats, with sacrifice,\nThe western spirit, and the north, to rise!\nLet on Patroclus' pile your blast be driven,\nAnd bear the blazing honours high to heaven.\"\nSwift as the word she vanish'd from their view;\nSwift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;\nForth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,\nAnd heaps on heaps the clouds are toss'd before.\nTo the wide main then stooping from the skies,\nThe heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:\nTroy feels the blast along her shaking walls,\nTill on the pile the gather'd tempest falls.\nThe structure crackles in the roaring fires,\nAnd all the night the plenteous flame aspires.\nAll night Achilles hails Patroclus' soul,\nWith large libations from the golden bowl.\nAs a poor father, helpless and undone,\nMourns o'er the ashes of an only son,\nTakes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,\nAnd pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:\nSo stay'd Achilles, circling round the shore,\nSo watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.\n'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night,\nThe morning planet told the approach of light;\nAnd, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray\nO'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day:\nThen sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd,\nAnd to their caves the whistling winds return'd:\nAcross the Thracian seas their course they bore;\nThe ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.\nThen parting from the pile he ceased to weep,\nAnd sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,\nExhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd\nOf thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;\nThe tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook\nUnwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:\n\"Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!\nFirst let us quench the yet remaining flame\nWith sable wine; then, as the rites direct,\nThe hero's bones with careful view select:\n(Apart, and easy to be known they lie\nAmidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:\nThe rest around the margin will be seen\nPromiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)\nThese wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare;\nAnd in the golden vase dispose with care;\nThere let them rest with decent honour laid,\nTill I shall follow to the infernal shade.\nMeantime erect the tomb with pious hands,\nA common structure on the humble sands:\nHereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,\nAnd late posterity record our praise!\"\nThe Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,\nWide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw,\nAnd deep subsides the ashy heap below.\nNext the white bones his sad companions place,\nWith tears collected, in the golden vase.\nThe sacred relics to the tent they bore;\nThe urn a veil of linen covered o'er.\nThat done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,\nAnd cast the deep foundations round the pyre;\nHigh in the midst they heap the swelling bed\nOf rising earth, memorial of the dead.\nThe swarming populace the chief detains,\nAnd leads amidst a wide extent of plains;\nThere placed them round: then from the ships proceeds\nA train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,\nVases and tripods (for the funeral games),\nResplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.\nFirst stood the prizes to reward the force\nOf rapid racers in the dusty course:\nA woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,\nSkill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom;\nAnd a large vase, where two bright handles rise,\nOf twenty measures its capacious size.\nThe second victor claims a mare unbroke,\nBig with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:\nThe third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame;\nFour ample measures held the shining frame:\nTwo golden talents for the fourth were placed:\nAn ample double bowl contents the last.\nThese in fair order ranged upon the plain,\nThe hero, rising, thus address'd the train:\n\"Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed\nTo the brave rulers of the racing steed;\nPrizes which none beside ourself could gain,\nShould our immortal coursers take the plain;\n(A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god\nPeleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)\nBut this no time our vigour to display;\nNor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:\nLost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck\nTheir flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.\nSad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,\nAnd trail those graceful honours on the sand!\nLet others for the noble task prepare,\nWho trust the courser and the flying car.\"\nFired at his word the rival racers rise;",

            "text": "But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,\nFamed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,\nAnd skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.\nWith equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd,\nThe steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell'd\n(Which late obey'd the Dardan chief's command,\nWhen scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand).\nThen Menelaus his Podargus brings,\nAnd the famed courser of the king of kings:\nWhom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),\nTo 'scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,\n(\u00c6the her name) at home to end his days;\nBase wealth preferring to eternal praise.\nNext him Antilochus demands the course\nWith beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.\nExperienced Nestor gives his son the reins,\nDirects his judgment, and his heat restrains;\nNor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears\nThe prudent son with unattending ears.\n\"My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,\nThe gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd;\nNeptune and Jove on thee conferr'd the skill\nSwift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.\nTo guide thy conduct little precept needs;\nBut slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.\nFear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;\nCompare those rivals' judgment and thy own:\nIt is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,\nAnd to be swift is less than to be wise.\n'Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes\nThe dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;\nBy art the pilot, through the boiling deep\nAnd howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;\nAnd 'tis the artist wins the glorious course;\nNot those who trust in chariots and in horse.\nIn vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,\nAnd short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive:\nWhile with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,\nThe knowing racer to his end proceeds;\nFix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,\nHis hand unerring steers the steady horse,\nAnd now contracts, or now extends the rein,\nObserving still the foremost on the plain.\nMark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;\nYon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;\nOf some once stately oak the last remains,\nOr hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:\nInclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;\nAnd round, a circle for the wheeling car.\n(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;\nOr then, as now, the limit of a race.)\nBear close to this, and warily proceed,\nA little bending to the left-hand steed;\nBut urge the right, and give him all the reins;\nWhile thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,\nAnd turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,\nThe wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.\nYet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)\nClear of the stony heap direct the course;\nLest through incaution failing, thou mayst be\nA joy to others, a reproach to me.\nSo shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,\nAnd leave unskilful swiftness far behind:\nThough thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed\nWhich bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;\nOr the famed race, through all the regions known,\nThat whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon.\"\nThus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage\nConcludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.\nNext bold Meriones was seen to rise,\nThe last, but not least ardent for the prize.\nThey mount their seats; the lots their place dispose\n(Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).\nYoung Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;\nAnd next the brother of the king of men:\nThy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;\nAnd, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.\nThey stand in order, an impatient train:\nPelides points the barrier on the plain,\nAnd sends before old Ph\u0153nix to the place,\nTo mark the racers, and to judge the race.\nAt once the coursers from the barrier bound;\nThe lifted scourges all at once resound;\nTheir heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;\nAnd up the champaign thunder from the shore:\nThick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,\nAnd the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;\nLoose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,\nFloat in their speed, and dance upon the wind:\nThe smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,\nNow seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.\nWhile hot for fame, and conquest all their care,\n(Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)\nErect with ardour, poised upon the rein,\nThey pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.\nNow (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)\nAt the near prize each gathers all his soul,\nEach burns with double hope, with double pain,\nTears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.\nFirst flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;\nWith those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:\nClose on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,\nAnd seem just mounting on his car behind;\nFull on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,\nAnd, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.\nThen had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;\nBut angry Ph\u0153bus to Tydides flies,\nStrikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain\nHis matchless horses' labour on the plain.\nRage fills his eye with anguish, to survey\nSnatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.\nThe fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,\nSprings to her knight, and gives the scourge again,\nAnd fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke\nShe breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:\nNo more their way the startled horses held;\nThe car reversed came rattling on the field;\nShot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,\nProne on the dust the unhappy master fell;\nHis batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;\nNose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:\nGrief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:\nBefore him far the glad Tydides flies;\nMinerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,\nAnd crowns him victor of the labour'd race.\nThe next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;\nWhile thus young Nestor animates his steeds:\n\"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;\nNot that we hope to match Tydides' horse,\nSince great Minerva wings their rapid way,\nAnd gives their lord the honours of the day;\nBut reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo\nYour swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?\nThrough your neglect, if lagging on the plain\nThe last ignoble gift be all we gain,\nNo more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,\nThe old man's fury rises, and ye die.\nHaste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,\nPresents the occasion, could we use it right.\"\nThus he. The coursers at their master's threat\nWith quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.\nAnd now Antilochus with nice survey\nObserves the compass of the hollow way.\n'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,\nFast by the road a precipice was worn:\nHere, where but one could pass, to shun the throng\nThe Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.\nClose up the venturous youth resolves to keep,\nStill edging near, and bears him toward the steep.\nAtrides, trembling, casts his eye below,\nAnd wonders at the rashness of his foe.\n\"Hold, stay your steeds\u2014What madness thus to ride\nThis narrow way! take larger field (he cried),\nOr both must fall.\"\u2014Atrides cried in vain;\nHe flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.\nFar as an able arm the disk can send,\nWhen youthful rivals their full force extend,\nSo far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew\nBefore the king: he, cautious, backward drew\nHis horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears\nThe rattling ruin of the clashing cars,\nThe floundering coursers rolling on the plain,\nAnd conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.\nBut thus upbraids his rival as he flies:\n\"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!\nGo, but expect not I'll the prize resign;\nAdd perjury to fraud, and make it thine\u2014\"\nThen to his steeds with all his force he cries,\n\"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!\nYour rivals, destitute of youthful force,\nWith fainting knees shall labour in the course,\nAnd yield the glory yours.\"\u2014The steeds obey;\nAlready at their heels they wing their way,\nAnd seem already to retrieve the day.\nMeantime the Grecians in a ring beheld\nThe coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.\nThe first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;\nHigh on a rising ground, above the ring,\nThe monarch sat: from whence with sure survey\nHe well observed the chief who led the way,\nAnd heard from far his animating cries,\nAnd saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;\nOn whose broad front a blaze of shining white,\nLike the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.\nHe saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:\n\"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?\nOr can ye, all, another chief survey,\nAnd other steeds than lately led the way?\nThose, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,\nLie sure disabled in the middle field:\nFor, since the goal they doubled, round the plain\nI search to find them, but I search in vain.\nPerchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,\nAnd, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,\nShot from the chariot; while his coursers stray\nWith frantic fury from the destined way.\nRise then some other, and inform my sight,\nFor these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;\nYet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,\nThe great \u00c6tolian chief, renown'd in war.\"\n\"Old man! (O\u00efleus rashly thus replies)\nThy tongue too hastily confers the prize;\nOf those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,\nNor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.\nEumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,\nStill, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:\nI well discern him, as he shakes the rein,\nAnd hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain.\"\nThus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:\n\"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!\nContentious prince, of all the Greeks beside\nThe last in merit, as the first in pride!\nTo vile reproach what answer can we make?\nA goblet or a tripod let us stake,\nAnd be the king the judge. The most unwise\nWill learn their rashness, when they pay the price.\"\nHe said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,\nStern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn\nTo fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son\nAwful amidst them rose, and thus begun:\n\"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;\nMuch would ye blame, should others thus offend:\nAnd lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.\"\nNo sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,\nDrives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.\nHigh o'er his head the circling lash he wields:\nHis bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:\nHis car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,\nBright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,\nRefulgent through the cloud: no eye could find\nThe track his flying wheels had left behind:\nAnd the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace\nSo swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.\nNow victor at the goal Tydides stands,\nQuits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;\nFrom the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;\nThe well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:\nWith joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,\nThe tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:\nThese to the ships his train triumphant leads,\nThe chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.\nYoung Nestor follows (who by art, not force,\nO'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.\nBehind, Atrides urged the race, more near\nThan to the courser in his swift career\nThe following car, just touching with his heel\nAnd brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:\nSuch, and so narrow now the space between\nThe rivals, late so distant on the green;\nSo soon swift \u00c6the her lost ground regain'd,\nOne length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.\nMerion pursued, at greater distance still,",
