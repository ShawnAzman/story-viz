The priest being refused, and insolently\ndismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who\ninflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and\nencourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the\nrefusal of Chryse\u00efs. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,\nenters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;\nhowever, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on\nBrise\u00efs in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his\nforces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she\nsupplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her\nson, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit,\nincenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are\nreconciled by the address of Vulcan.\nThe time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine\nduring the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes,\nand twelve for Jupiter's stay with the \u00c6thiopians, at whose return\nThetis prefers her petition.

would'st thou know\nWhy angry Ph\u0153bus bends his fatal bow?\nFirst give thy faith, and plight a prince's word\nOf sure protection, by thy power and sword:\nFor I must speak what wisdom would conceal,\nAnd truths, invidious to the great, reveal,\nBold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,\nInstruct a monarch where his error lies;\nFor though we deem the short-lived fury past,\n'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.\"\nTo whom Pelides:\u2014\"From thy inmost soul\nSpeak what thou know'st, and speak without control.\nE'en by that god I swear who rules the day,\nTo whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.\nAnd whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare;\nLong as Achilles breathes this vital air,\nNo daring Greek, of all the numerous band,\nAgainst his priest shall lift an impious hand;\nNot e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,\nThe king of kings, shall touch that sacred head.\"\nEncouraged thus, the blameless man replies:\n\"Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,\nBut he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,\nApollo's vengeance for his injured priest.\nNor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,\nBut plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,\nTill the great king, without a ransom paid,\nTo her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.[54]\nPerhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,\nThe priest may pardon, and the god may spare.\"\nThe prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown\nThe monarch started from his shining throne;\nBlack choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,\nAnd from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire:\n\"Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,\nProphet of plagues, for ever boding ill!\nStill must that tongue some wounding message bring,\nAnd still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?\nFor this are Ph\u0153bus' oracles explored,\nTo teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?\nFor this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,\nIs heaven offended, and a priest profaned;\nBecause my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,\nAnd heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?\nA maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,\nSkill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace;\nNot half so dear were Clyt\u00e6mnestra's charms,\nWhen first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.\nYet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;\nOur cares are only for the public weal:\nLet me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,\nAnd suffer, rather than my people fall.\nThe prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,\nSo dearly valued, and so justly mine.\nBut since for common good I yield the fair,\nMy private loss let grateful Greece repair;\nNor unrewarded let your prince complain,\nThat he alone has fought and bled in vain.\"\n\"Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),\nFond of the power, but fonder of the prize!\nWould'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,\nThe due reward of many a well-fought field?\nThe spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,\nWe share with justice, as with toil we gain;\nBut to resume whate'er thy avarice craves\n(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.\nYet if our chief for plunder only fight,\nThe spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,\nWhene'er, by Jove's decree, our conquering powers\nShall humble to the dust her lofty towers.\"\nThen thus the king: \"Shall I my prize resign\nWith tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?\nGreat as thou art, and like a god in fight,\nThink not to rob me of a soldier's right.\nAt thy demand shall I restore the maid?\nFirst let the just equivalent be paid;\nSuch as a king might ask; and let it be\nA treasure worthy her, and worthy me.\nOr grant me this, or with a monarch's claim\nThis hand shall seize some other captive dame.\nThe mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;[55]\nUlysses' spoils, or even thy own, be mine.\nThe man who suffers, loudly may complain;\nAnd rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.\nBut this when time requires.\u2014It now remains\nWe launch a bark to plough the watery plains,\nAnd waft the sacrifice to Chrysa's shores,\nWith chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.\nSoon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,\nAnd some deputed prince the charge attend:\nThis Creta's king, or Ajax shall fulfil,\nOr wise Ulysses see perform'd our will;\nOr, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,\nAchilles' self conduct her o'er the main;\nLet fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,\nThe god propitiate, and the pest assuage.\"\n[Illustration: ] MARS\nAt this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:\n\"O tyrant, arm'd with insolence and pride!\nInglorious slave to interest, ever join'd\nWith fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!\nWhat generous Greek, obedient to thy word,\nShall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?\nWhat cause have I to war at thy decree?\nThe distant Trojans never injured me;\nTo Phthia's realms no hostile troops they led:\nSafe in her vales my warlike coursers fed;\nFar hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,\nAnd walls of rocks, secure my native reign,\nWhose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,\nRich in her fruits, and in her martial race.\nHither we sail'd, a voluntary throng,\nTo avenge a private, not a public wrong:\nWhat else to Troy the assembled nations draws,\nBut thine, ungrateful, and thy brother's cause?\nIs this the pay our blood and toils deserve;\nDisgraced and injured by the man we serve?\nAnd darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,\nDue to the deeds of many a dreadful day?\nA prize as small, O tyrant! match'd with thine,\nAs thy own actions if compared to mine.\nThine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,\nThough mine the sweat and danger of the day.\nSome trivial present to my ships I bear:\nOr barren praises pay the wounds of war.\nBut know, proud monarch, I'm thy slave no more;\nMy fleet shall waft me to Thessalia's shore:\nLeft by Achilles on the Trojan plain,\nWhat spoils, what conquests, shall Atrides gain?\"\nTo this the king: \"Fly, mighty warrior! fly;\nThy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.\nThere want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,\nAnd Jove himself shall guard a monarch's right.\nOf all the kings (the god's distinguish'd care)\nTo power superior none such hatred bear:\nStrife and debate thy restless soul employ,\nAnd wars and horrors are thy savage joy,\nIf thou hast strength, 'twas Heaven that strength bestow'd;\nFor know, vain man! thy valour is from God.\nHaste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away;\nRule thy own realms with arbitrary sway;\nI heed thee not, but prize at equal rate\nThy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.\nGo, threat thy earth-born Myrmidons:\u2014but here[56]\n'Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.\nKnow, if the god the beauteous dame demand,\nMy bark shall waft her to her native land;\nBut then prepare, imperious prince!

(he said)\nIll fits a chief who mighty nations guides,\nDirects in council, and in war presides;\nTo whom its safety a whole people owes,\nTo waste long nights in indolent repose.\nMonarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear,\nThou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.\nIn just array draw forth the embattled train,\nAnd lead the Grecians to the dusty plain;\nE'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy\nThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.\nFor now no more the gods with fate contend,\nAt Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.\nDestruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,\nAnd nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.\nThis hear observant, and the gods obey!'\nThe vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.\nNow, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,\nUnite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.\nBut first, with caution, try what yet they dare,\nWorn with nine years of unsuccessful war.\nTo move the troops to measure back the main,\nBe mine; and yours the province to detain.\"\nHe spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,\n(Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd,)\n\"Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,\nNor doubt the vision of the powers divine;\nSent by great Jove to him who rules the host,\nForbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!\nThen let us haste, obey the god's alarms,\nAnd join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms.\"\nThus spoke the sage: the kings without delay\nDissolve the council, and their chief obey:\nThe sceptred rulers lead; the following host,\nPour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.\nAs from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees\nClustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,\nRolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,\nWith deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;\nDusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,\nAnd o'er the vale descends the living cloud.[81]\nSo, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train\nSpreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:\nAlong the region runs a deafening sound;\nBeneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.\nFame flies before the messenger of Jove,\nAnd shining soars, and claps her wings above.\nNine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud[82]\nThe monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.\nSoon as the throngs in order ranged appear,\nAnd fainter murmurs died upon the ear,\nThe king of kings his awful figure raised:\nHigh in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;\nThe golden sceptre, of celestial flame,\nBy Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.\nTo Pelops he the immortal gift resign'd;\nThe immortal gift great Pelops left behind,\nIn Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,\nTo rich Thyestes next the prize descends;\nAnd now the mark of Agamemnon's reign,\nSubjects all Argos, and controls the main.[83]\nOn this bright sceptre now the king reclined,\nAnd artful thus pronounced the speech design'd:\n\"Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader's care,\nHeroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!\nOf partial Jove with justice I complain,\nAnd heavenly oracles believed in vain\nA safe return was promised to our toils,\nRenown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.\nNow shameful flight alone can save the host,\nOur blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.\nSo Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!\nAt whose command whole empires rise or fall:\nHe shakes the feeble props of human trust,\nAnd towns and armies humbles to the dust.\nWhat shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,\nOh, lasting shame in every future age!\nOnce great in arms, the common scorn we grow,\nRepulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.\nSo small their number, that if wars were ceased,\nAnd Greece triumphant held a general feast,\nAll rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine\nMust want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.[84]\nBut other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,\nAnd Troy prevails by armies not her own.\nNow nine long years of mighty Jove are run,\nSince first the labours of this war begun:\nOur cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,\nAnd scarce insure the wretched power to fly.\nHaste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!\nOur weeping wives, our tender children call:\nLove, duty, safety, summon us away,\n'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey.\nOur shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,\nSafe and inglorious, to our native shore.\nFly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,\nAnd dream no more of heaven-defended Troy.\"\nHis deep design unknown, the hosts approve\nAtrides' speech.

by whom the mighty fall,\nWho bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!\nLet the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;\nAnd whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:\nWhile we from interdicted fields retire,\nNor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire.\"\nHer words allay the impetuous warrior's heat,\nThe god of arms and martial maid retreat;\nRemoved from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds\nThey sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.\nMeantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,\nAnd some bold chieftain every leader slew:\nFirst Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,\nHis death ennobled by Atrides' hand:\nAs he to flight his wheeling car address'd,\nThe speedy javelin drove from back to breast.\nIn dust the mighty Halizonian lay,\nHis arms resound, the spirit wings its way.\nThy fate was next, O Ph\u00e6stus! doom'd to feel\nThe great Idomeneus' protended steel;\nWhom Borus sent (his son and only joy)\nFrom fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.\nThe Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,\nAnd pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;\nBack from the car he tumbles to the ground,\nAnd everlasting shades his eyes surround.\nThen died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,\nIn woods and wilds to wound the savage race;\nDiana taught him all her sylvan arts,\nTo bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:\nBut vainly here Diana's arts he tries,\nThe fatal lance arrests him as he flies;\nFrom Menelaus' arm the weapon sent,\nThrough his broad back and heaving bosom went:\nDown sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\nHis brazen armour rings against the ground.\nNext artful Phereclus untimely fell;\nBold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.\nThy father's skill, O Phereclus! was thine,\nThe graceful fabric and the fair design;\nFor loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart\nTo him the shipwright's and the builder's art.\nBeneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,\nThe fatal cause of all his country's woes;\nBut he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,\nNor saw his country's peril, nor his own.\nThe hapless artist, while confused he fled,\nThe spear of Merion mingled with the dead.\nThrough his right hip, with forceful fury cast,\nBetween the bladder and the bone it pass'd;\nProne on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,\nAnd death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.\nFrom Meges' force the swift Pedaeus fled,\nAntenor's offspring from a foreign bed,\nWhose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,\nNursed the young stranger with a mother's care.\nHow vain those cares! when Meges in the rear\nFull in his nape infix'd the fatal spear;\nSwift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,\nAnd the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.\nThen died Hypsenor, generous and divine,\nSprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line,\nWho near adored Scamander made abode,\nPriest of the stream, and honoured as a god.\nOn him, amidst the flying numbers found,\nEurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;\nOn his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,\nThence glancing downwards, lopp'd his holy hand,\nWhich stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.\nDown sunk the priest: the purple hand of death\nClosed his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.\nThus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.\nIn every quarter fierce Tydides raged;\nAmid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,\nRapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain;\nNow here, now there, he darts from place to place,\nPours on the rear, or lightens in their face.\nThus from high hills the torrents swift and strong\nDeluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,\nThrough ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,\nO'erwhelm's the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;\nThe yellow harvests of the ripen'd year,\nAnd flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear![144]",

bed;\nNot thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,\nIn rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might.\"\nHector obedient heard: and, with a bound,\nLeap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;\nThrough all his host inspiring force he flies,\nAnd bids the thunder of the battle rise.\nWith rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,\nAnd turn the tide of conflict on the foe:\nFierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;\nAll Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;\nSome god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,\nShot down avenging from the vault of stars.\nThen thus aloud: \"Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!\nAnd you whom distant nations send to war!\nBe mindful of the strength your fathers bore;\nBe still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.\nOne hour demands me in the Trojan wall,\nTo bid our altars flame, and victims fall:\nNor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,\nAnd reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.\"\nThis said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;\nThe shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,\nHis neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;\nAnd as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.\nNow paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),[167]\nWhere daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son\nBetween both armies met: the chiefs from far\nObserved each other, and had mark'd for war.\nNear as they drew, Tydides thus began:\n\"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?\nOur eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,\nWhere fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;\nYet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,\nAnd meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.\nUnhappy they, and born of luckless sires,\nWho tempt our fury when Minerva fires!\nBut if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,\nKnow with immortals we no more contend.\nNot long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,\nThat daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.\nBacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,\nWith brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:\nTheir consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,\nWith curling vines and twisted ivy bound;\nWhile Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,\nAnd Thetis' arms received the trembling god.\nNor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;\n(The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)\nDeprived of sight by their avenging doom,\nCheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,\nThen sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,\nA wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!\nI brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth\nSustain thy life, and human be thy birth,\nBold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,\nApproach, and enter the dark gates of death.\"\n\"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,\n(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?\nLike leaves on trees the race of man is found,\nNow green in youth, now withering on the ground;\nAnother race the following spring supplies;\nThey fall successive, and successive rise:\nSo generations in their course decay;\nSo flourish these, when those are pass'd away.\nBut if thou still persist to search my birth,\nThen hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.\n\"A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,\n(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)\n\u00c6olian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,\nIn ancient time the happy wall possess'd,\nThen call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;\nGreat Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,\nWho o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,\nLoved for that valour which preserves mankind.\nThen mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,\nWhose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.\nWith direful jealousy the monarch raged,\nAnd the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.\nFor him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,\nAnd strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:\nIn vain she tempted the relentless youth,\nEndued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.\nFired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,\nAnd begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:\nIncensed he heard, resolving on his fate;\nBut hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:\nTo Lycia the devoted youth he sent,\nWith tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.[168]\nNow bless'd by every power who guards the good,\nThe chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:\nThere Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,\nNine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.\nBut when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,\nThe faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:\nThe fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,\nThe deathful secret to the king reveal'd.\nFirst, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;\nA mingled monster of no mortal kind!\nBehind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;\nA goat's rough body bore a lion's head;\nHer pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;\nHer gaping throat emits infernal fire.\n\"This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,\nAnd trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)\nThen met in arms the Solym\u00e6an crew,[169]\n(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;\nNext the bold Amazons' whole force defied;\nAnd conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.\n\"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,\nAt his return, a treacherous ambush rose,\nWith levell'd spears along the winding shore:\nThere fell they breathless, and return'd no more.\n\"At length the monarch, with repentant grief,\nConfess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;\nHis daughter gave, the stranger to detain,\nWith half the honours of his ample reign:\nThe Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,\nWith woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.\nThere long the chief his happy lot possess'd,\nWith two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;\n(Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love\nCrown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)\nBut when at last, distracted in his mind,\nForsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,\nWide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,\nA long, forlorn, uncomfortable way![170]\nWoes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:\nHis beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;\nHis eldest born by raging Mars was slain,\nIn combat on the Solymaean plain.\nHippolochus survived: from him I came,\nThe honour'd author of my birth and name;\nBy his decree I sought the Trojan town;\nBy his instructions learn to win renown,\nTo stand the first in worth as in command,\nTo add new honours to my native land,\nBefore my eyes my mighty sires to place,\nAnd emulate the glories of our race.\"\nHe spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;\nIn earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,\nThen friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:\n\"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!\nThus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,\nNor stain the sacred friendship of our race.\nKnow, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;\n\u0152neus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:\nOur ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,\nWhere twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.\nThe parting heroes mutual presents left;\nA golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;\n\u0152neus a belt of matchless work bestowed,\nThat rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.\n(This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored\nAmong my treasures, still adorns my board:\nFor Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall\nBeheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)\nMindful of this, in friendship let us join;\nIf heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,\nMy guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.\nEnough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,\nIn the full harvest of yon ample field;\nEnough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;\nBut thou and Diomed be foes no more.\nNow change we arms, and prove to either host\nWe guard the friendship of the line we boast.\"\nThus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,\nTheir hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;\nBrave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,\n(Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)\nFor Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,\nFor which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)\nHe gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,[171]\nA hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.\nMeantime the guardian of the Trojan state,\nGreat Hector, enter'd at the Sc\u00e6an gate.[172]\nBeneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,\nThe Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids\nAround him flock'd, all press'd with pious care\nFor husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.\nHe bids the train in long procession go,\nAnd seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.\nAnd now to Priam's stately courts he came,\nRais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;\nO'er these a range of marble structure runs,\nThe rich pavilions of his fifty sons,\nIn fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,[173]\nOpposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.\nTwelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,\nOf equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.\nHither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen\nOf royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.\n(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face\nSurpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)\nLong in a strict embrace she held her son,\nAnd press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:\n\"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls\nMy son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;\nCom'st thou to supplicate the almighty power\nWith lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?\nStay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,\nIn Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,\nAnd pay due vows to all the gods around.\nThen with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,\nAnd draw new spirits from the generous bowl;\nSpent as thou art with long laborious fight,\nThe brave defender of thy country's right.\"\n\"Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)\nInflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,\nUnnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.\nLet chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice\nTo sprinkle to the gods, its better use.\nBy me that holy office were profaned;\nIll fits it me, with human gore distain'd,\nTo the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,\nOr offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.\nYou, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,\nAnd burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.\nThe largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,\nMost prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\nBefore the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altar led.\nSo may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare;\nAnd far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\nWho mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.\nBe this, O mother, your religious care:\nI go to rouse soft Paris to the war;\nIf yet not lost to all the sense of shame,\nThe recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.\nOh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,\nThat pest of Troy, that ruin of our race![174]\nDeep to the dark abyss might he descend,\nTroy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end.\"\nThis heard, she gave command: and summon'd came\nEach noble matron and illustrious dame.\nThe Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,\nWhere treasured odours breathed a costly scent.\nThere lay the vestures of no vulgar art,\nSidonian maids embroider'd every part,\nWhom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,\nWith Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.\nHere, as the queen revolved with careful eyes\nThe various textures and the various dyes,\nShe chose a veil that shone superior far,\nAnd glow'd refulgent as the morning star.\nHerself with this the long procession leads;\nThe train majestically slow proceeds.\nSoon as to Ilion's topmost tower they come,\nAnd awful reach the high Palladian dome,\nAntenor's consort, fair Theano, waits\nAs Pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates.\nWith hands uplifted and imploring eyes,\nThey fill the dome with supplicating cries.\nThe priestess then the shining veil displays,\nPlaced on Minerva's knees, and thus she prays:\n\"Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,\nTroy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid!\nBreak thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall\nProne on the dust before the Trojan wall!\nSo twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,\nShall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.\nBut thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,\nOurselves, our infants, and our city spare!\"\nSo pray'd the priestess in her holy fane;\nSo vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.\nWhile these appear before the power with prayers,\nHector to Paris' lofty dome repairs.[175]\nHimself the mansion raised, from every part\nAssembling architects of matchless art.\nNear Priam's court and Hector's palace stands\nThe pompous structure, and the town commands.\nA spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,\nOf full ten cubits was the lance's length,\nThe steely point with golden ringlets join'd,\nBefore him brandish'd, at each motion shined\nThus entering, in the glittering rooms he found\nHis brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,\nHis eyes delighting with their splendid show,\nBrightening the shield, and polishing the bow.\nBeside him Helen with her virgins stands,\nGuides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.\nHim thus inactive, with an ardent look\nThe prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.\n\"Thy hate to Troy, is this the time to show?\n(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country's foe!)\nParis and Greece against us both conspire,\nThy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.\nFor thee great Ilion's guardian heroes fall,\nTill heaps of dead alone defend her wall,\nFor thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,\nAnd wasteful war in all its fury burns.\nUngrateful man! deserves not this thy care,\nOur troops to hearten, and our toils to share?\nRise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,\nAnd all the Phrygian glories at an end.\"\n\"Brother, 'tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)\nThy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:\nYet charge my absence less, O generous chief!\nOn hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief:\nHere, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,\nAnd mourn'd, in secret, his and Ilion's fate.\n'Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms,\nAnd beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.\nConquest to-day my happier sword may bless,\n'Tis man's to fight, but heaven's to give success.\nBut while I arm, contain thy ardent mind;\nOr go, and Paris shall not lag behind.\"\n[Illustration: ] HECTOR CHIDING PARIS\nHe said, nor answer'd Priam's warlike son;\nWhen Helen thus with lowly grace begun:\n\"Oh, generous brother! (if the guilty dame\nThat caused these woes deserve a sister's name!)\nWould heaven, ere all these dreadful deeds were done,\nThe day that show'd me to the golden sun\nHad seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear\nThe fatal infant to the fowls of air?\nWhy sunk I not beneath the whelming tide,\nAnd midst the roarings of the waters died?\nHeaven fill'd up all my ills, and I accursed\nBore all, and Paris of those ills the worst.\nHelen at least a braver spouse might claim,\nWarm'd with some virtue, some regard of fame!\nNow tired with toils, thy fainting limbs recline,\nWith toils, sustain'd for Paris' sake and mine\nThe gods have link'd our miserable doom,\nOur present woe, and infamy to come:\nWide shall it spread, and last through ages long,\nExample sad! and theme of future song.\"\nThe chief replied: \"This time forbids to rest;\nThe Trojan bands, by hostile fury press'd,\nDemand their Hector, and his arm require;\nThe combat urges, and my soul's on fire.\nUrge thou thy knight to march where glory calls,\nAnd timely join me, ere I leave the walls.\nEre yet I mingle in the direful fray,\nMy wife, my infant, claim a moment's stay;\nThis day (perhaps the last that sees me here)\nDemands a parting word, a tender tear:\nThis day, some god who hates our Trojan land\nMay vanquish Hector by a Grecian hand.\"\nHe said, and pass'd with sad presaging heart\nTo seek his spouse, his soul's far dearer part;\nAt home he sought her, but he sought in vain;\nShe, with one maid of all her menial train,\nHad hence retired; and with her second joy,\nThe young Astyanax, the hope of Troy,\nPensive she stood on Ilion's towery height,\nBeheld the war, and sicken'd at the sight;\nThere her sad eyes in vain her lord explore,\nOr weep the wounds her bleeding country bore.\nBut he who found not whom his soul desired,\nWhose virtue charm'd him as her beauty fired,\nStood in the gates, and ask'd \"what way she bent\nHer parting step? If to the fane she went,\nWhere late the mourning matrons made resort;\nOr sought her sisters in the Trojan court?\"\n\"Not to the court, (replied the attendant train,)\nNor mix'd with matrons to Minerva's fane:\nTo Ilion's steepy tower she bent her way,\nTo mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.\nTroy fled, she heard, before the Grecian sword;\nShe heard, and trembled for her absent lord:\nDistracted with surprise, she seem'd to fly,\nFear on her cheek, and sorrow in her eye.\nThe nurse attended with her infant boy,\nThe young Astyanax, the hope of Troy.\"\nHector this heard, return'd without delay;\nSwift through the town he trod his former way,\nThrough streets of palaces, and walks of state;\nAnd met the mourner at the Sc\u00e6an gate.\nWith haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair.\nHis blameless wife, A\u00ebtion's wealthy heir\n(Cilician Thebe great A\u00ebtion sway'd,\nAnd Hippoplacus' wide extended shade):\nThe nurse stood near, in whose embraces press'd,\nHis only hope hung smiling at her breast,\nWhom each soft charm and early grace adorn,\nFair as the new-born star that gilds the morn.\nTo this loved infant Hector gave the name\nScamandrius, from Scamander's honour'd stream;\nAstyanax the Trojans call'd the boy,\nFrom his great father, the defence of Troy.\nSilent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign'd\nTo tender passions all his mighty mind;\nHis beauteous princess cast a mournful look,\nHung on his hand, and then dejected spoke;\nHer bosom laboured with a boding sigh,\nAnd the big tear stood trembling in her eye.\n[Illustration: ] THE MEETING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE\n\"Too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run?\nAh, too forgetful of thy wife and son!\nAnd think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,\nA widow I, a helpless orphan he?\nFor sure such courage length of life denies,\nAnd thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.\nGreece in her single heroes strove in vain;\nNow hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain.\nO grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his doom,\nAll I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!\nSo shall my days in one sad tenor run,\nAnd end with sorrows as they first begun.\nNo parent now remains my griefs to share,\nNo father's aid, no mother's tender care.\nThe fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,\nLaid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!\nHis fate compassion in the victor bred;\nStern as he was, he yet revered the dead,\nHis radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,\nAnd laid him decent on the funeral pile;\nThen raised a mountain where his bones were burn'd,\nThe mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn'd,\nJove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow\nA barren shade, and in his honour grow.\n\"By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;\nIn one sad day beheld the gates of hell;\nWhile the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed,\nAmid their fields the hapless heroes bled!\nMy mother lived to wear the victor's bands,\nThe queen of Hippoplacia's sylvan lands:\nRedeem'd too late, she scarce beheld again\nHer pleasing empire and her native plain,\nWhen ah! oppress'd by life-consuming woe,\nShe fell a victim to Diana's bow.\n\"Yet while my Hector still survives, I see\nMy father, mother, brethren, all, in thee:\nAlas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all\nOnce more will perish, if my Hector fall,\nThy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:\nOh, prove a husband's and a father's care!\nThat quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy,\nWhere yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy;\nThou, from this tower defend the important post;\nThere Agamemnon points his dreadful host,\nThat pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,\nAnd there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.\nThrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,\nOr led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.\nLet others in the field their arms employ,\nBut stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy.\"\nThe chief replied: \"That post shall be my care,\nNot that alone, but all the works of war.\nHow would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd,\nAnd Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground\nAttaint the lustre of my former name,\nShould Hector basely quit the field of fame?\nMy early youth was bred to martial pains,\nMy soul impels me to the embattled plains!\nLet me be foremost to defend the throne,\nAnd guard my father's glories, and my own.\n\"Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates!\n(How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)\nThe day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend,\nAnd see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.\nAnd yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,\nMy mother's death, the ruin of my kind,\nNot Priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore,\nNot all my brothers gasping on the shore;\nAs thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread:\nI see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!\nIn Argive looms our battles to design,\nAnd woes, of which so large a part was thine!\nTo bear the victor's hard commands, or bring\nThe weight of waters from Hyperia's spring.\nThere while you groan beneath the load of life,\nThey cry, 'Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'\nSome haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,\nImbitters all thy woes, by naming me.\nThe thoughts of glory past, and present shame,\nA thousand griefs shall waken at the name!\nMay I lie cold before that dreadful day,\nPress'd with a load of monumental clay!\nThy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,\nShall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.\"\nThus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy\nStretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.\nThe babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,\nScared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.\nWith secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,\nAnd Hector hasted to relieve his child,\nThe glittering terrors from his brows unbound,\nAnd placed the beaming helmet on the ground;\nThen kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,\nThus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:\n\"O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,\nAnd all ye deathless powers! protect my son!\nGrant him, like me, to purchase just renown,\nTo guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,\nAgainst his country's foes the war to wage,\nAnd rise the Hector of the future age!\nSo when triumphant from successful toils\nOf heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,\nWhole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,\nAnd say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame:'\nWhile pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,\nHis mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.\"\nHe spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,\nRestored the pleasing burden to her arms;\nSoft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,\nHush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.\nThe troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,\nShe mingled with a smile a tender tear.\nThe soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,\nAnd dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:\n\"Andromache! my soul's far better part,\nWhy with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?\nNo hostile hand can antedate my doom,\nTill fate condemns me to the silent tomb.\nFix'd is the term to all the race of earth;\nAnd such the hard condition of our birth:\nNo force can then resist, no flight can save,\nAll sink alike, the fearful and the brave.\nNo more\u2014but hasten to thy tasks at home,\nThere guide the spindle, and direct the loom:\nMe glory summons to the martial scene,\nThe field of combat is the sphere for men.\nWhere heroes war, the foremost place I claim,\nThe first in danger as the first in fame.\"\nThus having said, the glorious chief resumes\nHis towery helmet, black with shading plumes.\nHis princess parts with a prophetic sigh,\nUnwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye\nThat stream'd at every look; then, moving slow,\nSought her own palace, and indulged her woe.\nThere, while her tears deplored the godlike man,",

Apollo, seeing her\ndescend from Olympus, joins her near the Sc\u00e6an gate. They agree to put\noff the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge\nthe Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the\nchallenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after\nseveral attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a\ncouncil, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which\nParis will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam\nsends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning\nthe dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the\nfunerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,\nerect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with\ntowers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his\njealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both\narmies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans\nwith thunder, and other signs of his wrath.\nThe three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax,\nthe next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the\nfuneral rites of the slain and one more in building the\nfortification before the ships. So that somewhat about three days\nis employed in this book. The scene lies wholly in the field.",

O scandal of your race,\nWhose coward souls your manly form disgrace,\nHow great the shame, when every age shall know\nThat not a Grecian met this noble foe!\nGo then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,\nA heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!\nBe what ye seem, unanimated clay,\nMyself will dare the danger of the day;\n'Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,\nBut in the hands of God is victory.\"\nThese words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,\nHis manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.\nThat day, Atrides! a superior hand\nHad stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;\nBut all at once, thy fury to compose,\nThe kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;\nEven he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd\nThy daring hand, and this advice address'd:\n\"Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,\nAnd tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?\nGrieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;\nGreat Hector's arm is mightier far than thine:\nEven fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,\nAnd trembling met this dreadful son of war.\nSit thou secure, amidst thy social band;\nGreece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.\nThe mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,\nThough bold and burning with desire of fame,\nContent the doubtful honour might forego,\nSo great the danger, and so brave the foe.\"\nHe said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;\nHe stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,\nNo longer bent to rush on certain harms;\nHis joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.\nHe from whose lips divine persuasion flows,\nGrave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;\nThus to the kings he spoke: \"What grief, what shame\nAttend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!\nHow shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn\nTheir sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!\nWhat tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,\nO Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!\nOnce with what joy the generous prince would hear\nOf every chief who fought this glorious war,\nParticipate their fame, and pleased inquire\nEach name, each action, and each hero's sire!\nGods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,\nAnd trembling all before one hostile hand;\nHow would he lift his aged arms on high,\nLament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!\nOh! would to all the immortal powers above,\nMinerva, Ph\u0153bus, and almighty Jove!\nYears might again roll back, my youth renew,\nAnd give this arm the spring which once it knew\nWhen fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,\nI led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,\nAnd with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,\nWhere Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.[179]\nThere Ereuthalion braved us in the field,\nProud Areithous' dreadful arms to wield;\nGreat Areithous, known from shore to shore\nBy the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;\nNo lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,\nBut broke, with this, the battle of the foe.\nHim not by manly force Lycurgus slew,\nWhose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,\nDeep in a winding way his breast assailed,\nNor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.\nSupine he fell: those arms which Mars before\nHad given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:\nBut when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,\nTo Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.\nFurious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,\nAnd dared the trial of the strongest hands;\nNor could the strongest hands his fury stay:\nAll saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway\nTill I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,\nAnd, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.\nI fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd:\nProne fell the giant o'er a length of ground.\nWhat then I was, O were your Nestor now!\nNot Hector's self should want an equal foe.\nBut, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,\nThe flower of Greece, the examples of our host,\nSprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,\nCan you stand trembling, and desert the day?\"\nHis warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;\nAnd nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,\nUp-started fierce: but far before the rest\nThe king of men advanced his dauntless breast:\nThen bold Tydides, great in arms, appear'd;\nAnd next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear'd;\nO\u00efleus follow'd; Idomen was there,[180]\nAnd Merion, dreadful as the god of war:\nWith these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,\nAnd wise Ulysses closed the daring band.\nAll these, alike inspired with noble rage,\nDemand the fight.

By heaven inspired,\nLeap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.\nThis from the right to left the herald bears,\nHeld out in order to the Grecian peers;\nEach to his rival yields the mark unknown,\nTill godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;\nSurveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,\nThen casts before him, and with transport cries:\n\"Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;\nBe mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.\nNow while my brightest arms my limbs invest,\nTo Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:\nBut pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,\nAnd deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.\nSaid I in secret? No, your vows declare\nIn such a voice as fills the earth and air,\nLives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?\nAjax, in all the toils of battle bred!\nFrom warlike Salamis I drew my birth,\nAnd, born to combats, fear no force on earth.\"\nHe said. The troops with elevated eyes,\nImplore the god whose thunder rends the skies:\n\"O father of mankind, superior lord!\nOn lofty Ida's holy hill adored:\nWho in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,\nSupreme of gods! unbounded and alone:\nGrant thou, that Telamon may bear away\nThe praise and conquest of this doubtful day;\nOr, if illustrious Hector be thy care,\nThat both may claim it, and that both may share.\"\nNow Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;\nSheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:\nHe moves to combat with majestic pace;\nSo stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,[182]\nWhen Jove to punish faithless men prepares,\nAnd gives whole nations to the waste of wars,\nThus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;\nGrimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:[183]\nHis massy javelin quivering in his hand,\nHe stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.\nThrough every Argive heart new transport ran;\nAll Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:\nEven Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,\nFelt his great heart suspended in his breast:\n'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;\nHimself had challenged, and the foe drew near.\nStern Telamon behind his ample shield,\nAs from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.\nHuge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,\nOf tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,\n(The work of Tychius, who in Hyl\u00e8 dwell'd\nAnd in all arts of armoury excell'd,)\nThis Ajax bore before his manly breast,\nAnd, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:\n\"Hector! approach my arm, and singly know\nWhat strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.\nAchilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,\nNot void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:\nLet him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,\nIndulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;\nWhole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,\nAnd sends thee one, a sample of her host,\nSuch as I am, I come to prove thy might;\nNo more\u2014be sudden, and begin the fight.\"\n\"O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!\n(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)\nMe, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,\nNew to the field, and trembling at the fight?\nThou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,\nTo combat born, and bred amidst alarms:\nI know to shift my ground, remount the car,\nTurn, charge, and answer every call of war;\nTo right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,\nAnd bear thick battle on my sounding shield/\nBut open be our fight, and bold each blow;\nI steal no conquest from a noble foe.\"\nHe said, and rising, high above the field\nWhirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.\nFull on the brass descending from above\nThrough six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,\nTill in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;\nThrough Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,\nHis corslet enters, and his garment rends,\nAnd glancing downwards, near his flank descends.\nThe wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low\nBeneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.\nFrom their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,\nThen close impetuous, and the charge renew;\nFierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,\nOr foaming boars, the terror of the wood.\nAt Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;\nThe blunted point against the buckler bends;\nBut Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,\nDrove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;\nIt reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!\nSpouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.\nYet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,\nIn his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,\nBlack, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;\nFull on the brazen boss the stone descends;\nThe hollow brass resounded with the shock:\nThen Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,\nApplied each nerve, and swinging round on high,\nWith force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;\nThe huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:\nHis slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;\nGreat Hector falls extended on the field,\nHis bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:\nNor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might\nConfirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.\nAnd now both heroes their broad falchions drew\nIn flaming circles round their heads they flew;\nBut then by heralds' voice the word was given.\nThe sacred ministers of earth and heaven:\nDivine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,\nAnd sage Id\u00e6us on the part of Troy,\nBetween the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;\nAnd first Id\u00e6us' awful voice was heard:\n[Illustration: ] HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS\n\"Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,\nBoth dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.\nTo either host your matchless worth is known,\nEach sounds your praise, and war is all your own.\nBut now the Night extends her awful shade;\nThe goddess parts you; be the night obey'd.\"[184]\nTo whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:\n\"O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.\nLet him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,\nLet him demand the sanction of the night;\nIf first he ask'd it, I content obey,\nAnd cease the strife when Hector shows the way.\"\n\"O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin'd)\nWhom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,\nWith strength of body, and with worth of mind!\nNow martial law commands us to forbear;\nHereafter we shall meet in glorious war,\nSome future day shall lengthen out the strife,\nAnd let the gods decide of death or life!\nSince, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,\nAnd heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.\nReturn, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,\nAnd joy the nations whom thy arm defends;\nAs I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,\nWho wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.\nBut let us, on this memorable day,\nExchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,\n'Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;\nAnd each brave foe was in his soul a friend.'\"\nWith that, a sword with stars of silver graced,\nThe baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,\nHe gave the Greek.

His friend obey'd with haste,\nThrough intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;\nThe chiefs descending from their car he found:\nThe panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.\nThe warriors standing on the breezy shore,\nTo dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,\nHere paused a moment, while the gentle gale\nConvey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;\nThen to consult on farther methods went,\nAnd took their seats beneath the shady tent.\nThe draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,\nArsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:\n(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,\nGreece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)\nA table first with azure feet she placed;\nWhose ample orb a brazen charger graced;\nHoney new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,\nAnd wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,\nNext her white hand an antique goblet brings,\nA goblet sacred to the Pylian kings\nFrom eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,\nTwo feet support it, and four handles hold;\nOn each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,\nIn sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:\nA massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,\nWhen the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.\nTemper'd in this, the nymph of form divine\nPours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;\nWith goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,\nAnd last with flour the smiling surface strows:\nThis for the wounded prince the dame prepares:\nThe cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:\nSalubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,\nAnd pleasing conference beguiles the day.\nMeantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,\nUnheard approached, and stood before the tent.\nOld Nestor, rising then, the hero led\nTo his high seat: the chief refused and said:\n\"'Tis now no season for these kind delays;\nThe great Achilles with impatience stays.\nTo great Achilles this respect I owe;\nWho asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,\nWas borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?\nWith grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.\nThis to report, my hasty course I bend;\nThou know'st the fiery temper of my friend.\"\n\"Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin'd)\nExcite compassion in Achilles' mind?\nSeeks he the sorrows of our host to know?\nThis is not half the story of our woe.\nTell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,\nOur bravest heroes in the navy groan,\nUlysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,\nAnd stern Eurypylus, already bleed.\nBut, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!\nAchilles heeds not, but derides our pain:\nEven till the flames consume our fleet he stays,\nAnd waits the rising of the fatal blaze.\nChief after chief the raging foe destroys;\nCalm he looks on, and every death enjoys.\nNow the slow course of all-impairing time\nUnstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;\nOh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,\nWhen this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,\nThe bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,\nAnd stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!\nThen from my fury fled the trembling swains,\nAnd ours was all the plunder of the plains:\nFifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,\nAs many goats, as many lowing kine:\nAnd thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,\nAll teeming females, and of generous breeds.\nThese, as my first essay of arms, I won;\nOld Neleus gloried in his conquering son.\nThus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,\nAnd shares were parted to each Pylian lord.\nThe state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,\nWhen the proud Elians first commenced the war:\nFor Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;\nOf twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!\nOppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,\nMy sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.\n(That large reprisal he might justly claim,\nFor prize defrauded, and insulted fame,\nWhen Elis' monarch, at the public course,\nDetain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)\nThe rest the people shared; myself survey'd\nThe just partition, and due victims paid.\nThree days were past, when Elis rose to war,\nWith many a courser, and with many a car;\nThe sons of Actor at their army's head\n(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.\nHigh on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,\nOur utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:\nNot far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:\nThe stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.\nPallas, descending in the shades of night,\nAlarms the Pylians and commands the fight.\nEach burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,\nMyself the foremost; but my sire denied;\nFear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;\nAnd stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.\nMy sire denied in vain: on foot I fled\nAmidst our chariots; for the goddess led.\n\"Along fair Arene's delightful plain\nSoft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:\nThere, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,\nAnd sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.\nThence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,\nTo great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.\nThere first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;\nAn untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;\nA bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain\nTo the blue monarch of the watery main.\nIn arms we slept, beside the winding flood,\nWhile round the town the fierce Epeians stood.\nSoon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,\nFlamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.\nBright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;\nThe nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.\nThe first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;\nKing Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:\n(She that all simples' healing virtues knew,\nAnd every herb that drinks the morning dew:)\nI seized his car, the van of battle led;\nThe Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.\nThe foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,\nFierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:\nFull fifty captive chariots graced my train;\nTwo chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.\nThen Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds\nThe youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.\nO'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,\nCollecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,\nThrough wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,\nWhere o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;\nTill Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.\nEven there the hindmost of the rear I slay,\nAnd the same arm that led concludes the day;\nThen back to Pyle triumphant take my way.\nThere to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,\nAs first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.\nSuch then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;\nSo proved my valour for my country's good.\n\"Achilles with unactive fury glows,\nAnd gives to passion what to Greece he owes.\nHow shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade\nHer hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!\nO friend!

be brave.'\nMenoetius thus: 'Though great Achilles shine\nIn strength superior, and of race divine,\nYet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;\nLet thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'\nThus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:\nWords now forgot, though now of vast import.\nAh!

shall Greece yet stand?\nResists she yet the raging Hector's hand?\nOr are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,\nAnd this the period of our wars and fame?\"\nEurypylus replies: \"No more, my friend;\nGreece is no more! this day her glories end;\nEven to the ships victorious Troy pursues,\nHer force increasing as her toil renews.\nThose chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,\nLie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.\nBut, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,\nLead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;\nWith lukewarm water wash the gore away;\nWith healing balms the raging smart allay,\nSuch as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,\nOnce taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.\nOf two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands\nThis hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;\nAnd great Machaon, wounded in his tent,\nNow wants that succour which so oft he lent.\"\nTo him the chief: \"What then remains to do?\nThe event of things the gods alone can view.\nCharged by Achilles' great command I fly,\nAnd bear with haste the Pylian king's reply:\nBut thy distress this instant claims relief.\"\nHe said, and in his arms upheld the chief.",

Across the warrior's way,\nRent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;\nIn modern ages not the strongest swain\nCould heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:\nHe poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,\nIt flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;\nFull on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,\nThe ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.\nAs skilful divers from some airy steep\nHeadlong descend, and shoot into the deep,\nSo falls Epicles; then in groans expires,\nAnd murmuring to the shades the soul retires.\nWhile to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,\nFrom Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;\nThe bearded shaft the destined passage found,\nAnd on his naked arm inflicts a wound.\nThe chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast\nMight stop the progress of his warlike host,\nConceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height\nRetired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.\nDivine Sarpedon with regret beheld\nDisabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;\nHis beating breast with generous ardour glows,\nHe springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.\nAlcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;\nDeep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;\nThen from the yawning wound with fury tore\nThe spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:\nDown sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\nHis brazen armour rings against the ground.\nSwift to the battlement the victor flies,\nTugs with full force, and every nerve applies:\nIt shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;\nThe rolling ruins smoke along the field.\nA mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;\nAnd, like a deluge, rushes in the war.\nAt once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,\nAnd Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;\nFix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,\nAnd through his buckler drove the trembling wood;\nBut Jove was present in the dire debate,\nTo shield his offspring, and avert his fate.\nThe prince gave back, not meditating flight,\nBut urging vengeance, and severer fight;\nThen raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,\nHis fainting squadrons to new fury warms.\n\"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?\nYour former fame and ancient virtue lost!\nThe breach lies open, but your chief in vain\nAttempts alone the guarded pass to gain:\nUnite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:\nThe force of powerful union conquers all.\"\nThis just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;\nThey join, they thicken, and the assault renew:\nUnmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,\nAnd fix'd support the weight of all the war;\nNor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,\nNor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.\nAs on the confines of adjoining grounds,\nTwo stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;\nThey tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,\nOne foot, one inch, of the contended field;\nThus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;\nNor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.\nTheir manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,\nLoud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;\nThe copious slaughter covers all the shore,\nAnd the high ramparts drip with human gore.\nAs when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,\nFrom side to side the trembling balance nods,\n(While some laborious matron, just and poor,\nWith nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)\nTill poised aloft, the resting beam suspends\nEach equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:[227]\nSo stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,\nWith fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.\nFierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,\nAnd fires his host with loud repeated cries.\n\"Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,\nHaste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!\"\nThey hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,\nRaise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:\nAround the works a wood of glittering spears\nShoots up, and all the rising host appears.\nA ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,\nPointed above, and rough and gross below:\nNot two strong men the enormous weight could raise,\nSuch men as live in these degenerate days:\nYet this, as easy as a swain could bear\nThe snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air;\nFor Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load\nThe unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.\nThus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,\nOf massy substance, and stupendous frame;\nWith iron bars and brazen hinges strong,\nOn lofty beams of solid timber hung:\nThen thundering through the planks with forceful sway,\nDrives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,\nThe folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door\nLeap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.\nNow rushing in, the furious chief appears,\nGloomy as night![228] and shakes two shining spears:\nA dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,\nAnd from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.\nHe moves a god, resistless in his course,\nAnd seems a match for more than mortal force.\nThen pouring after, through the gaping space,\nA tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;\nThe Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;\nThe shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.",

the fated time, the appointed shore:\nHark! the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!\nImpetuous Hector thunders at the wall;\nThe hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall.\"\nThese words the Grecians' fainting hearts inspire,\nAnd listening armies catch the godlike fire.\nFix'd at his post was each bold Ajax found,\nWith well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:\nSo close their order, so disposed their fight,\nAs Pallas' self might view with fix'd delight;\nOr had the god of war inclined his eyes,\nThe god of war had own'd a just surprise.\nA chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,\nDescending Hector and his battle wait.\nAn iron scene gleams dreadful o'er the fields,\nArmour in armour lock'd, and shields in shields,\nSpears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,\nHelms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.\nThe floating plumes unnumber'd wave above,\nAs when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;\nAnd levell'd at the skies with pointing rays,\nTheir brandish'd lances at each motion blaze.\nThus breathing death, in terrible array,\nThe close compacted legions urged their way:\nFierce they drove on, impatient to destroy;\nTroy charged the first, and Hector first of Troy.\nAs from some mountain's craggy forehead torn,\nA rock's round fragment flies, with fury borne,\n(Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,)\nPrecipitate the ponderous mass descends:\nFrom steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds;\nAt every shock the crackling wood resounds;\nStill gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain,\nWhirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:\nThere stops\u2014so Hector. Their whole force he proved,[230]\nResistless when he raged, and, when he stopp'd, unmoved.\nOn him the war is bent, the darts are shed,\nAnd all their falchions wave around his head:\nRepulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires;\nBut with repeated shouts his army fires.\n\"Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way\nThrough yon square body, and that black array:\nStand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,\nStrong as they seem, embattled like a tower;\nFor he that Juno's heavenly bosom warms,\nThe first of gods, this day inspires our arms.\"\nHe said; and roused the soul in every breast:\nUrged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,\nForth march'd Deiphobus; but, marching, held\nBefore his wary steps his ample shield.\nBold Merion aim'd a stroke (nor aim'd it wide);\nThe glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;\nBut pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,\nThe point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.\nThe Trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear,\nOn the raised orb to distance bore the spear.\nThe Greek, retreating, mourn'd his frustrate blow,\nAnd cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;\nThen to the ships with surly speed he went,\nTo seek a surer javelin in his tent.\nMeanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,\nThe tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.\nBy Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,\nThe son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.\nEre yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,\nIn fair Pedaeus' verdant pastures bred,\nThe youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms,\nAnd blest in bright Medesicaste's arms:\n(This nymph, the fruit of Priam's ravish'd joy,\nAllied the warrior to the house of Troy:)\nTo Troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came,\nAnd match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame:\nWith Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne,\nHe lived, beloved and honour'd as his own.\nHim Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:\nHe groans beneath the Telamonian spear.\nAs from some far-seen mountain's airy crown,\nSubdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,\nAnd soils its verdant tresses on the ground;\nSo falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.\nThen Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,\nFrom Hector's hand a shining javelin fled:\nHe saw, and shunn'd the death; the forceful dart\nSung on, and pierced Amphimachus's heart,\nCteatus' son, of Neptune's forceful line;\nVain was his courage, and his race divine!\nProstrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,\nAnd his broad buckler thunders on the ground.\nTo seize his beamy helm the victor flies,\nAnd just had fastened on the dazzling prize,\nWhen Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung;\nFull on the shield's round boss the weapon rung;\nHe felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel,\nSecure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel.\nRepulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain\nThe spoils contested, and bear off the slain.\nBetween the leaders of the Athenian line,\n(Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)\nDeplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;\nImbrius remains the fierce Ajaces' prize.\nAs two grim lions bear across the lawn,\nSnatch'd from devouring hounds, a slaughter'd fawn.\nIn their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,\nAnd sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;\nSo these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead\nStrips his bright arms; O\u00efleus lops his head:\nToss'd like a ball, and whirl'd in air away,\nAt Hector's feet the gory visage lay.\nThe god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,\nAnd pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,\nInspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,\nAnd breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.\nSwift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,\nHe finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,\nHis pensive brow the generous care express'd\nWith which a wounded soldier touch'd his breast,\nWhom in the chance of war a javelin tore,\nAnd his sad comrades from the battle bore;\nHim to the surgeons of the camp he sent:\nThat office paid, he issued from his tent\nFierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,\nIn Thoas' voice, Andr\u00e6mon's valiant son,\nWho ruled where Calydon's white rocks arise,\nAnd Pleuron's chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:\n\"Where's now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,\nOf Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?\"\nTo whom the king: \"On Greece no blame be thrown;\nArms are her trade, and war is all her own.\nHer hardy heroes from the well-fought plains\nNor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:\n'Tis heaven, alas! and Jove's all-powerful doom,\nThat far, far distant from our native home\nWills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!\nOnce foremost in the fight, still prone to lend\nOr arms or counsels, now perform thy best,\nAnd what thou canst not singly, urge the rest.\"\nThus he: and thus the god whose force can make\nThe solid globe's eternal basis shake:\n\"Ah! never may he see his native land,\nBut feed the vultures on this hateful strand,\nWho seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,\nNor dares to combat on this signal day!\nFor this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,\nAnd urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.\nTogether let us battle on the plain;\nTwo, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:\nNot vain the weakest, if their force unite;\nBut ours, the bravest have confess'd in fight.\"\nThis said, he rushes where the combat burns;\nSwift to his tent the Cretan king returns:\nFrom thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,\nAnd clad in arms that lighten'd all the strand,\nFierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,\nLike lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,\nWhich to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,\nOr terrifies the offending world with wars;\nIn streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,\nFrom pole to pole the trail of glory flies:\nThus his bright armour o'er the dazzled throng\nGleam'd dreadful, as the monarch flash'd along.\nHim, near his tent, Meriones attends;\nWhom thus he questions: \"Ever best of friends!\nO say, in every art of battle skill'd,\nWhat holds thy courage from so brave a field?\nOn some important message art thou bound,\nOr bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?\nInglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,\nAnd glows with prospects of th' approaching day.\"\n\"O prince! (Meriones replies) whose care\nLeads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;\nThis speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;\nThe rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield.\"\nTo whom the Cretan: \"Enter, and receive\nThe wonted weapons; those my tent can give;\nSpears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)\nThat shed a lustre round the illumined wall,\nThough I, disdainful of the distant war,\nNor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,\nYet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;\nAnd thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.\nEnter, and see on heaps the helmets roll'd,\nAnd high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold.\"\n\"Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;\nWe too can boast of no ignoble spoils:\nBut those my ship contains; whence distant far,\nI fight conspicuous in the van of war,\nWhat need I more? If any Greek there be\nWho knows not Merion, I appeal to thee.\"\nTo this, Idomeneus: \"The fields of fight\nHave proved thy valour, and unconquer'd might:\nAnd were some ambush for the foes design'd,\nEven there thy courage would not lag behind:\nIn that sharp service, singled from the rest,\nThe fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.\nNo force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;\nHe shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:\nA dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;\nAgainst his bosom beats his quivering heart;\nTerror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;\nWith chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,\nAnd looks a bloodless image of despair!\nNot so the brave\u2014still dauntless, still the same,\nUnchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:\nComposed his thought, determined is his eye,\nAnd fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:\nIf aught disturb the tenour of his breast,\n'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.\n\"In such assays thy blameless worth is known,\nAnd every art of dangerous war thy own.\nBy chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,\nThose wounds were glorious all, and all before;\nSuch as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight\nT'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.\nBut why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,\nStand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?\nGo\u2014from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,\nAnd to their owners send them nobly back.\"\nSwift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear\nAnd, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.",

what I judge the best,\nSee, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,\nAnd war's whole fury burns around thy head.\nBehold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,\nHow many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!\nWhat troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!\nAnd what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!\nHere cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings\nConvoked to council, weigh the sum of things.\nWhether (the gods succeeding our desires)\nTo yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;\nOr quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,\nContented with the conquest of the day.\nI fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,\nPay the large debt of last revolving sun;\nAchilles, great Achilles, yet remains\nOn yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!\"\nThe counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,\nLeap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;\nSwift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.\n\"To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,\nAnd here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;\nWhere yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,\nAnd hasten back to end the doubtful day.\"\nThis said, the towering chief prepares to go,\nShakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,\nAnd seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.\nThrough all his host, inspiring force, he flies,\nAnd bids anew the martial thunder rise.\nTo Panthus' son, at Hector's high command\nHaste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:\nBut round the battlements, and round the plain,\nFor many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain;",

for his fate was near,\nDue to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:\nYet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,\nAnd gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!\nNow all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes\nBurn at each foe, and single every prize;\nStill at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,\nHe points his ardour, and exerts his might.\nThe Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,\nOn all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:\nSo some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,[241]\nBy winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,\nUnmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,\nAnd sees the watery mountains break below.\nGirt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall\nLike fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:\nBursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,\nAnd, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;\nWhite are the decks with foam; the winds aloud\nHowl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:\nPale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;\nAnd instant death on every wave appears.\nSo pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,\nThe chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.\nAs when a lion, rushing from his den,\nAmidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,\n(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,\nAt large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)\nLeaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;\nThe trembling herdsman far to distance flies;\nSome lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)\nHe singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.\nThus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew\nAll Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:\nMycenian Periphes, a mighty name,\nIn wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;\nThe minister of stern Eurystheus' ire\nAgainst Alcides, Copreus was his sire:\nThe son redeem'd the honours of the race,\nA son as generous as the sire was base;\nO'er all his country's youth conspicuous far\nIn every virtue, or of peace or war:\nBut doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!\nAgainst the margin of his ample shield\nHe struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;\nSupine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.\nOn the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,\nAnd plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.\nHis circling friends, who strove to guard too late\nThe unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.\nChased from the foremost line, the Grecian train\nNow man the next, receding toward the main:\nWedged in one body at the tents they stand,\nWall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.\nNow manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;\nNow fear itself confines them to the fight:\nMan courage breathes in man; but Nestor most\n(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)\nExhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;\nAnd by their parents, by themselves implores.\n\"Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame\nWith mutual honour, and with mutual shame!\nThink of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care\nYour wives, your infants, and your parents share:\nThink of each living father's reverend head;\nThink of each ancestor with glory dead;\nAbsent, by me they speak, by me they sue,\nThey ask their safety, and their fame, from you:\nThe gods their fates on this one action lay,\nAnd all are lost, if you desert the day.\"\nHe spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;\nMinerva seconds what the sage inspires.\nThe mist of darkness Jove around them threw\nShe clear'd, restoring all the war to view;\nA sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain,\nAnd show'd the shores, the navy, and the main:\nHector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,\nThe scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,\nFirst of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes,\nHis port majestic, and his ample size:\nA ponderous mace with studs of iron crown'd,\nFull twenty cubits long, he swings around;\nNor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands\nBut looks a moving tower above the bands;\nHigh on the decks with vast gigantic stride,\nThe godlike hero stalks from side to side.\nSo when a horseman from the watery mead\n(Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed)\nDrives four fair coursers, practised to obey,\nTo some great city through the public way;\nSafe in his art, as side by side they run,\nHe shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;\nAnd now to this, and now to that he flies;\nAdmiring numbers follow with their eyes.\nFrom ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew,\nNo less the wonder of the warring crew.\nAs furious, Hector thunder'd threats aloud,\nAnd rush'd enraged before the Trojan crowd;\nThen swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores\nLay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores;\nSo the strong eagle from his airy height,\nWho marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight,\nStoops down impetuous, while they light for food,\nAnd, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.\nJove leads him on with his almighty hand,\nAnd breathes fierce spirits in his following band.\nThe warring nations meet, the battle roars,\nThick beats the combat on the sounding prores.\nThou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,\nNo force could tame them, and no toil could tire;\nAs if new vigour from new fights they won,\nAnd the long battle was but then begun.\nGreece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war,\nSecure of death, confiding in despair:\nTroy in proud hopes already view'd the main\nBright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:\nLike strength is felt from hope, and from despair,\nAnd each contends, as his were all the war.\n'Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand\nFirst seized a ship on that contested strand;\nThe same which dead Protesila\u00fcs bore,[242]\nThe first that touch'd the unhappy Trojan shore:\nFor this in arms the warring nations stood,\nAnd bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.\nNo room to poise the lance or bend the bow;\nBut hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:\nWounded, they wound; and seek each other's hearts\nWith falchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts.\nThe falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,\nSwords flash in air, or glitter on the ground;\nWith streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,\nAnd slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.\nStill raging, Hector with his ample hand\nGrasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:\n[Illustration: ] AJAX DEFENDING THE GREEK SHIPS\n\"Haste, bring the flames! that toil of ten long years\nIs finished; and the day desired appears!\nThis happy day with acclamations greet,\nBright with destruction of yon hostile fleet.\nThe coward-counsels of a timorous throng\nOf reverend dotards check'd our glory long:\nToo long Jove lull'd us with lethargic charms,\nBut now in peals of thunder calls to arms:\nIn this great day he crowns our full desires,\nWakes all our force, and seconds all our fires.\"\nHe spoke\u2014the warriors at his fierce command\nPour a new deluge on the Grecian band.\nEven Ajax paused, (so thick the javelins fly,)\nStepp'd back, and doubted or to live or die.\nYet, where the oars are placed, he stands to wait\nWhat chief approaching dares attempt his fate:\nEven to the last his naval charge defends,\nNow shakes his spear, now lifts, and now protends;\nEven yet, the Greeks with piercing shouts inspires,\nAmidst attacks, and deaths, and darts, and fires.\n\"O friends! O heroes! names for ever dear,\nOnce sons of Mars, and thunderbolts of war!\nAh! yet be mindful of your old renown,\nYour great forefathers' virtues and your own.\nWhat aids expect you in this utmost strait?\nWhat bulwarks rising between you and fate?\nNo aids, no bulwarks your retreat attend,\nNo friends to help, no city to defend.\nThis spot is all you have, to lose or keep;\nThere stand the Trojans, and here rolls the deep.\n'Tis hostile ground you tread; your native lands\nFar, far from hence: your fates are in your hands.\"\nRaging he spoke; nor further wastes his breath,",

desist, nor tempt an equal blow:\nTo me the spoils my prowess won, resign:\nDepart with life, and leave the glory mine.\"\nThe Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd\nWith generous anguish, and in scorn return'd:\n\"Laugh'st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,\nWhen mortals boast of prowess not their own?\nNot thus the lion glories in his might,\nNor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,\nNor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)\nMan only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.\nBut far the vainest of the boastful kind,\nThese sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.\nYet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel\nThis boaster's brother, Hyperenor, fell;\nAgainst our arm which rashly he defied,\nVain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.\nThese eyes beheld him on the dust expire,\nNo more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.\nPresumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,\nGo, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;\nOr, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\"\nUnmoved, Euphorbus thus: \"That action known,\nCome, for my brother's blood repay thy own.\nHis weeping father claims thy destined head,\nAnd spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.\nOn these thy conquer'd spoils I shall bestow,\nTo soothe a consort's and a parent's woe.\nNo longer then defer the glorious strife,\nLet heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.\"\nSwift as the word the missile lance he flings;\nThe well-aim'd weapon on the buckler rings,\nBut blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.\nOn Jove the father great Atrides calls,\nNor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,\nIt pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;\nWide through the neck appears the grisly wound,\nProne sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.\nThe shining circlets of his golden hair,\nWhich even the Graces might be proud to wear,\nInstarr'd with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,\nWith dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.\nAs the young olive, in some sylvan scene,\nCrown'd by fresh fountains with eternal green,\nLifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,\nAnd plays and dances to the gentle air;\nWhen lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades\nThe tender plant, and withers all its shades;\nIt lies uprooted from its genial bed,\nA lovely ruin now defaced and dead:\nThus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,\nWhile the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.\nProud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,\nAffrighted Troy the towering victor flies:\nFlies, as before some mountain lion's ire\nThe village curs and trembling swains retire,\nWhen o'er the slaughter'd bull they hear him roar,\nAnd see his jaws distil with smoking gore:\nAll pale with fear, at distance scatter'd round,\nThey shout incessant, and the vales resound.\nMeanwhile Apollo view'd with envious eyes,\nAnd urged great Hector to dispute the prize;\n(In Mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care\nThe rough Ciconians learn'd the trade of war;)[247]\n\"Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase\nAchilles' coursers, of ethereal race;\nThey stoop not, these, to mortal man's command,\nOr stoop to none but great Achilles' hand.\nToo long amused with a pursuit so vain,\nTurn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;\nBy Sparta slain! for ever now suppress'd\nThe fire which burn'd in that undaunted breast!\"\nThus having spoke, Apollo wing'd his flight,\nAnd mix'd with mortals in the toils of fight:\nHis words infix'd unutterable care\nDeep in great Hector's soul: through all the war\nHe darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view'd\nThe breathless hero in his blood imbued,\n(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)\nAnd in the victor's hands the shining prey.\nSheath'd in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,\nAnd sends his voice in thunder to the skies:\nFierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,\nIt flew, and fired the nations as it went.\nAtrides from the voice the storm divined,\nAnd thus explored his own unconquer'd mind:\n\"Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,\nSlain in my cause, and for my honour slain!\nDesert the arms, the relics, of my friend?\nOr singly, Hector and his troops attend?\nSure where such partial favour heaven bestow'd,\nTo brave the hero were to brave the god:\nForgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;\n'Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.\nYet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,\nDid but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:\nStill would we turn, still battle on the plains,\nAnd give Achilles all that yet remains\nOf his and our Patroclus\u2014\" This, no more\nThe time allow'd: Troy thicken'd on the shore.",

I desert my train?\n'Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;\nI joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,\nAnd hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.\nBut Jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd,\nThe strong he withers, and confounds the bold;\nNow crowns with fame the mighty man, and now\nStrikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!\nCome, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,\nAnd thou be witness, if I fear to-day;\nIf yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,\nOr yet their hero dare defend the dead.\"\nThen turning to the martial hosts, he cries:\n\"Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!\nBe men, my friends, in action as in name,\nAnd yet be mindful of your ancient fame.\nHector in proud Achilles' arms shall shine,\nTorn from his friend, by right of conquest mine.\"\nHe strode along the field, as thus he said:\n(The sable plumage nodded o'er his head:)\nSwift through the spacious plain he sent a look;\nOne instant saw, one instant overtook\nThe distant band, that on the sandy shore\nThe radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.\nThere his own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd;\nHis train to Troy convey'd the massy load.\nNow blazing in the immortal arms he stands;\nThe work and present of celestial hands;\nBy aged Peleus to Achilles given,\nAs first to Peleus by the court of heaven:\nHis father's arms not long Achilles wears,\nForbid by fate to reach his father's years.\nHim, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,\nThe god whose thunder rends the troubled air\nBeheld with pity; as apart he sat,\nAnd, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate.\nHe shook the sacred honours of his head;\nOlympus trembled, and the godhead said;\n\"Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!\nA moment's glory; and what fates attend!\nIn heavenly panoply divinely bright\nThou stand'st, and armies tremble at thy sight,\nAs at Achilles' self! beneath thy dart\nLies slain the great Achilles' dearer part.\nThou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,\nWhich once the greatest of mankind had worn.\nYet live! I give thee one illustrious day,\nA blaze of glory ere thou fad'st away.\nFor ah! no more Andromache shall come\nWith joyful tears to welcome Hector home;\nNo more officious, with endearing charms,\nFrom thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides' arms!\"\nThen with his sable brow he gave the nod\nThat seals his word; the sanction of the god.\nThe stubborn arms (by Jove's command disposed)\nConform'd spontaneous, and around him closed:\nFill'd with the god, enlarged his members grew,\nThrough all his veins a sudden vigour flew,\nThe blood in brisker tides began to roll,\nAnd Mars himself came rushing on his soul.\nExhorting loud through all the field he strode,\nAnd look'd, and moved, Achilles, or a god.\nNow Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,\nNow Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;\nThe great Thersilochus like fury found,\nAsteropaeus kindled at the sound,\nAnd Ennomus, in augury renown'd.\n\"Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber'd bands\nOf neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!\n'Twas not for state we summon'd you so far,\nTo boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:\nYe came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,\nTo save our present, and our future race.\nFor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,\nAnd glean the relics of exhausted Troy.\nNow then, to conquer or to die prepare;\nTo die or conquer are the terms of war.\nWhatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,\nWhoe'er shall drag him to the Trojan train,\nWith Hector's self shall equal honours claim;\nWith Hector part the spoil, and share the fame.\"\nFired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,\nThey join, they thicken, they protend their spears;\nFull on the Greeks they drive in firm array,\nAnd each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:\nVain hope! what numbers shall the field o'erspread,\nWhat victims perish round the mighty dead!\nGreat Ajax mark'd the growing storm from far,\nAnd thus bespoke his brother of the war:\n\"Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;\nAnd all our wars and glories at an end!\n'Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,\nCondemn'd to vultures on the Trojan plain;\nWe too must yield: the same sad fate must fall\nOn thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.\nSee what a tempest direful Hector spreads,\nAnd lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!\nCall on our Greeks, if any hear the call,\nThe bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all.\"\nThe warrior raised his voice, and wide around\nThe field re-echoed the distressful sound.\n\"O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given\nThe rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!\nWhom with due honours both Atrides grace:\nYe guides and guardians of our Argive race!\nAll, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,\nAll, whom I see not through this cloud of war;\nCome all! let generous rage your arms employ,\nAnd save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy.\"",

in life's first bloom he fell,\nSent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.\nOnce more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies;\nThe Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,\nShunn'd the descending death; which hissing on,\nStretch'd in the dust the great Iphytus' son,\nSchedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind\nThe boldest warrior and the noblest mind:\nIn little Panope, for strength renown'd,\nHe held his seat, and ruled the realms around.\nPlunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,\nAnd deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;\nIn clanging arms the hero fell and all\nThe fields resounded with his weighty fall.\nPhorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,\nThe Telamonian lance his belly rends;\nThe hollow armour burst before the stroke,\nAnd through the wound the rushing entrails broke:\nIn strong convulsions panting on the sands\nHe lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.\nStruck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:\nThe shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.\nAnd now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,\nFled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;\nGreece, in her native fortitude elate,\nWith Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:\nBut Ph\u0153bus urged \u00c6neas to the fight;\nHe seem'd like aged Periphas to sight:\n(A herald in Anchises' love grown old,\nRevered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)\nThus he\u2014\"What methods yet, O chief! remain,\nTo save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?\nThere have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,\nBy valour, numbers, and by arts of war,\nHave forced the powers to spare a sinking state,\nAnd gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:\nBut you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares\nHis partial favour, and assists your wars,\nYour shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,\nAnd force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.\"\n\u00c6neas through the form assumed descries\nThe power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries:\n\"Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,\nWe seek our ramparts, and desert the day.\nA god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,\nAnd tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms.\"\nHe spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:\nThe bold example all his hosts pursue.\nThen, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,\nIn vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;\nWho view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,\nSwift to revenge it sent his angry lance;\nThe whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,\nDescends, and pants in Apisaon's breast;\nFrom rich Paeonia's vales the warrior came,\nNext thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.\nAsteropeus with grief beheld the slain,\nAnd rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain:\nIndissolubly firm, around the dead,\nRank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,\nAnd hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,\nA brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.\nGreat Ajax eyes them with incessant care,\nAnd in an orb contracts the crowded war,\nClose in their ranks commands to fight or fall,\nAnd stands the centre and the soul of all:\nFix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;\nA sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:\nOn heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,\nAnd, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.\nGreece, in close order, and collected might,\nYet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;\nFierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,\nAnd now it rises, now it sinks by turns.\nIn one thick darkness all the fight was lost;\nThe sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host\nSeem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes,\nAnd all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.\nSuch o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,\nThe rest in sunshine fought, and open light;\nUnclouded there, the aerial azure spread,\nNo vapour rested on the mountain's head,\nThe golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,\nAnd all the broad expansion flamed with day.\nDispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,\nAnd here and there their scatter'd arrows light:\nBut death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,\nThere burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.\nMeanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,\n(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,\nAnd skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,\nWhen from the ships he sent the Pylian band.\nThe youthful brothers thus for fame contend,\nNor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;\nIn thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,\nGlorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.\nBut round the corse the heroes pant for breath,\nAnd thick and heavy grows the work of death:\nO'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,\nTheir knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er;\nDrops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,\nAnd carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.\nAs when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,\nStrain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,\nThe brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er\nThe extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:\nSo tugging round the corse both armies stood;\nThe mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;\nWhile Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,\nNow to the ships to force it, now to Troy.\nNot Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,\nNor he whose anger sets the world in arms,\nCould blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd;\nSuch, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.",

The chief of Troy descried,\nAnd call'd \u00c6neas fighting near his side.\n\"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,\nAchilles' car, deserted of its lord!\nThe glorious steeds our ready arms invite,\nScarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.\nCan such opponents stand when we assail?\nUnite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.\"\nThe son of Venus to the counsel yields;\nThen o'er their backs they spread their solid shields:\nWith brass refulgent the broad surface shined,\nAnd thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.\nThem Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;\nEach hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:\nIn vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,\nIn vain advance! not fated to return.\nUnmov'd, Automedon attends the fight,\nImplores the Eternal, and collects his might.\nThen turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:\n\"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!\nFull on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,\nFor hard the fight, determined is the foe;\n'Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,\nWar knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.\"\nThen through the field he sends his voice aloud,\nAnd calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,\nWith great Atrides. \"Hither turn, (he said,)\nTurn where distress demands immediate aid;\nThe dead, encircled by his friends, forego,\nAnd save the living from a fiercer foe.\nUnhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage\nThe force of Hector, and \u00c6neas' rage:\nYet mighty as they are, my force to prove\nIs only mine: the event belongs to Jove.\"\nHe spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,\nWhich pass'd the shield of Aretus the young:\nIt pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,\nThen in the lower belly struck the dart.\nAs when a ponderous axe, descending full,\nCleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:[249]\nStruck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,\nThen tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:\nThus fell the youth; the air his soul received,\nAnd the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.\nNow at Automedon the Trojan foe\nDischarged his lance; the meditated blow,\nStooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,\nAnd hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;\nDeep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear\nIn long vibrations spent its fury there.\nWith clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,\nBut each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;\nNor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,\nBut left their slain companion in his blood:\nHis arms Automedon divests, and cries,\n\"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:\nThus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,\nPoor as it is, some offering to thy shade.\"\nSo looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,\nAll grim with rage, and horrible with gore;\nHigh on the chariot at one bound he sprung,\nAnd o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.\nAnd now Minerva from the realms of air\nDescends impetuous, and renews the war;\nFor, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,\nThe lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.\nAs when high Jove denouncing future woe,\nO'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,\n(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,\nOr from the rage of man, destructive war,)\nThe drooping cattle dread the impending skies,\nAnd from his half-till'd field the labourer flies:\nIn such a form the goddess round her drew\nA livid cloud, and to the battle flew.\nAssuming Ph\u0153nix' shape on earth she falls,\nAnd in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:\n\"And lies Achilles' friend, beloved by all,\nA prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?\nWhat shame 'o Greece for future times to tell,\nTo thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!\"\n\"O chief, O father! (Atreus' son replies)\nO full of days! by long experience wise!\nWhat more desires my soul, than here unmoved\nTo guard the body of the man I loved?\nAh, would Minerva send me strength to rear\nThis wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!\nBut Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,\nAnd Jove's own glories blaze around his head!\"\nPleased to be first of all the powers address'd,\nShe breathes new vigour in her hero's breast,\nAnd fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,\nDesire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.\nSo burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o'er),\nRepulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;\n(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings\nUntamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.\nFired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,\nAnd sent his soul with every lance he threw.\nThere stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,\nA\u00ebtion's son, and Podes was his name:\nWith riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd,\nBy Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;\nThrough his broad belt the spear a passage found,\nAnd, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.\nSudden at Hector's side Apollo stood,\nLike Phaenops, Asius' son, appear'd the god;\n(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign\nIn fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)\n\"Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!\nWhat Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?\nDost thou at length to Menelaus yield,\nA chief once thought no terror of the field?\nYet singly, now, the long-disputed prize\nHe bears victorious, while our army flies:\nBy the same arm illustrious Podes bled;\nThe friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!\"\nThis heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,\nRage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.\nBut now the Eternal shook his sable shield,\nThat shaded Ide and all the subject field\nBeneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud\nInvolved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud;\nThe affrighted hills from their foundations nod,\nAnd blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:\nAt one regard of his all-seeing eye\nThe vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.\nThen trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;\nFor as the brave B\u0153otian turn'd his head\nTo face the foe, Polydamas drew near,\nAnd razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear:\nBy Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,\nPierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,\nGrasps his once formidable lance in vain.\nAs Hector follow'd, Idomen address'd\nThe flaming javelin to his manly breast;\nThe brittle point before his corslet yields;\nExulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:\nHigh on his chariots the Cretan stood,\nThe son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.\nBut erring from its aim, the impetuous spear\nStruck to the dust the squire and charioteer\nOf martial Merion: Coeranus his name,\nWho left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.\nOn foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,\nHad graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,\nBut the brave squire the ready coursers brought,\nAnd with his life his master's safety bought.\nBetween his cheek and ear the weapon went,\nThe teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.\nProne from the seat he tumbles to the plain;\nHis dying hand forgets the falling rein:\nThis Merion reaches, bending from the car,\nAnd urges to desert the hopeless war:\nIdomeneus consents; the lash applies;\nAnd the swift chariot to the navy flies.\nNot Ajax less the will of heaven descried,\nAnd conquest shifting to the Trojan side,\nTurn'd by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,\nTo Atreus's seed, the godlike Telamon:\n\"Alas! who sees not Jove's almighty hand\nTransfers the glory to the Trojan band?\nWhether the weak or strong discharge the dart,\nHe guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:\nNot so our spears; incessant though they rain,\nHe suffers every lance to fall in vain.\nDeserted of the god, yet let us try\nWhat human strength and prudence can supply;\nIf yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,\nMay glad the fleets that hope not our return,\nWho tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,\nAnd still hear Hector thundering at their gates.\nSome hero too must be despatch'd to bear\nThe mournful message to Pelides' ear;\nFor sure he knows not, distant on the shore,\nHis friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.\nBut such a chief I spy not through the host:\nThe men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost\nIn general darkness\u2014Lord of earth and air!\nOh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:\nDispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;\nGive me to see, and Ajax asks no more:\nIf Greece must perish, we thy will obey,\nBut let us perish in the face of day!\"\nWith tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer\nThe god relenting clear'd the clouded air;\nForth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;\nThe blaze of armour flash'd against the day.\n\"Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;\nIf yet Antilochus survives the fight,\nLet him to great Achilles' ear convey\nThe fatal news\"\u2014Atrides hastes away.\nSo turns the lion from the nightly fold,\nThough high in courage, and with hunger bold,\nLong gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,\nStiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;\nThe darts fly round him from a hundred hands,\nAnd the red terrors of the blazing brands:\nTill late, reluctant, at the dawn of day\nSour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,\nSo moved Atrides from his dangerous place\nWith weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;\nThe foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain,\nAnd much admonish'd, much adjured his train:\n\"O guard these relics to your charge consign'd,\nAnd bear the merits of the dead in mind;\nHow skill'd he was in each obliging art;\nThe mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:\nHe was, alas! but fate decreed his end,\nIn death a hero, as in life a friend!\"\nSo parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,\nAnd round on all sides sent his piercing view.\nAs the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye\nOf all that wings the mid a\u00ebrial sky,\nThe sacred eagle, from his walks above\nLooks down, and sees the distant thicket move;\nThen stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,\nSnatches his life amid the clouds of air.\nNot with less quickness, his exerted sight\nPass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight:\nTill on the left the chief he sought, he found,\nCheering his men, and spreading deaths around:\nTo him the king: \"Beloved of Jove! draw near,\nFor sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear;\nThy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn!\nHow Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.\nThis is not all: Patroclus, on the shore\nNow pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.\nFly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell\nThe sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:\nHe too may haste the naked corse to gain:\nThe arms are Hector's, who despoil'd the slain.\"\nThe youthful warrior heard with silent woe,\nFrom his fair eyes the tears began to flow:\nBig with the mighty grief, he strove to say\nWhat sorrow dictates, but no word found way.\nTo brave Laodocus his arms he flung,\nWho, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;\nThen ran the mournful message to impart,\nWith tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.\nSwift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands\n(Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands;\nBut bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;\nHimself returns to his Patroclus slain.\n\"Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);\nBut hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid:\nThough fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,\nUnarm'd, he fights not with the Trojan foe.\n'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,\n'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,\nAnd save ourselves, while with impetuous hate\nTroy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.\"\n\"'Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,\nWith Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear;\nMyself, and my bold brother will sustain\nThe shock of Hector and his charging train:\nNor fear we armies, fighting side by side;\nWhat Troy can dare, we have already tried,\nHave tried it, and have stood.\" The hero said.\nHigh from the ground the warriors heave the dead.\nA general clamour rises at the sight:\nLoud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.\nNot fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,\nWith rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,\nVoracious hounds, that many a length before\nTheir furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;\nBut if the savage turns his glaring eye,\nThey howl aloof, and round the forest fly.\nThus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,\nWave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:\nBut Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,\nAll pale they tremble and forsake the field.\nWhile thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,\nBehind them rages all the storm of war:\nConfusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng\nOf men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:\nLess fierce the winds with rising flames conspire\nTo whelm some city under waves of fire;\nNow sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,\nNow crack the blazing temples of the gods;\nThe rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,\nAnd sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.\nThe heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load:\nAs when two mules, along the rugged road,\nFrom the steep mountain with exerted strength\nDrag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length;\nInly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,\nThe enormous timber lumbering down the hill:\nSo these\u2014Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,\nAnd breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.\nThus when a river swell'd with sudden rains\nSpreads his broad waters o'er the level plains,\nSome interposing hill the stream divides,\nAnd breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.\nStill close they follow, close the rear engage;\n\u00c6neas storms, and Hector foams with rage:\nWhile Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,\nWedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,\nThat shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung\nHigh on poised pinions, threats their callow young.\nSo from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,\nSuch the wild terror, and the mingled cry:\nWithin, without the trench, and all the way,\nStrow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;\nSuch horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds\nThe work of death, and still the battle bleeds.\n[Illustration: ] VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM",

another dragg'd a dead;\nNow here, now there, the carcases they tore:\nFate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.\nAnd the whole war came out, and met the eye;\nAnd each bold figure seem'd to live or die.\nA field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,[256]\nThe third time labour'd by the sweating hind;\nThe shining shares full many ploughmen guide,\nAnd turn their crooked yokes on every side.\nStill as at either end they wheel around,\nThe master meets them with his goblet crown'd;\nThe hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,\nThen back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:\nBehind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;\nAnd sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.\nAnother field rose high with waving grain;\nWith bended sickles stand the reaper train:\nHere stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,\nSheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.\nWith sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;\nThe gatherers follow, and collect in bands;\nAnd last the children, in whose arms are borne\n(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.\nThe rustic monarch of the field descries,\nWith silent glee, the heaps around him rise.\nA ready banquet on the turf is laid,\nBeneath an ample oak's expanded shade.\nThe victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;\nThe reaper's due repast, the woman's care.\nNext, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,\nBent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;\nA deeper dye the dangling clusters show,\nAnd curl'd on silver props, in order glow:\nA darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;\nAnd pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.\nTo this, one pathway gently winding leads,\nWhere march a train with baskets on their heads,\n(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear\nThe purple product of the autumnal year.\nTo these a youth awakes the warbling strings,\nWhose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;\nIn measured dance behind him move the train,\nTune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.\nHere herds of oxen march, erect and bold,\nRear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,\nAnd speed to meadows on whose sounding shores\nA rapid torrent through the rushes roars:\nFour golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,\nAnd nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.\nTwo lions rushing from the wood appear'd;\nAnd seized a bull, the master of the herd:\nHe roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;\nThey tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.\nThe dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,\nDread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.\nNext this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads\nDeep through fair forests, and a length of meads,\nAnd stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;\nAnd fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.\nA figured dance succeeds; such once was seen\nIn lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,\nForm'd by Daedalean art; a comely band\nOf youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.\nThe maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;\nThe youths all graceful in the glossy vest:\nOf those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;\nOf these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,\nThat glittering gay, from silver belts depend.\nNow all at once they rise, at once descend,\nWith well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,\nConfusedly regular, the moving maze:\nNow forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,\nAnd undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:\nSo whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,\nAnd, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.\nThe gazing multitudes admire around:\nTwo active tumblers in the centre bound;\nNow high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:\nAnd general songs the sprightly revel end.\nThus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd\nWith his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:\nIn living silver seem'd the waves to roll,\nAnd beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.\nThis done, whate'er a warrior's use requires\nHe forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,\nThe greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd\nWith various sculpture, and the golden crest.\nAt Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:\nShe, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,\nSwift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,",

thou greatest power above,\nAll-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!\nAnd mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,\nAnd ye, fell furies of the realms of night,\nWho rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare\nFor perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!\nThe black-eyed maid inviolate removes,\nPure and unconscious of my manly loves.\nIf this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,\nAnd levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!\"\nWith that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;\nThe bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;\nThe sacred herald rolls the victim slain\n(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.\nThen thus Achilles: \"Hear, ye Greeks! and know\nWhate'er we feel, 'tis Jove inflicts the woe;\nNot else Atrides could our rage inflame,\nNor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.\n'Twas Jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,\nThat doom'd our strife, and doom'd the Greeks to fall.\nGo then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;\nAchilles waits ye, and expects the fight.\"\nThe speedy council at his word adjourn'd:\nTo their black vessels all the Greeks return'd.",

Such the lion's rage,\nWho viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,\nThough all in arms the peopled city rise,\nStalks careless on, with unregarding pride;\nTill at the length, by some brave youth defied,\nTo his bold spear the savage turns alone,\nHe murmurs fury with a hollow groan;\nHe grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,\nLash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;\nHe calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,\nResolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.\nSo fierce Achilles on \u00c6neas flies;\nSo stands \u00c6neas, and his force defies.\nEre yet the stern encounter join'd, begun\nThe seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:\n\"Why comes \u00c6neas through the ranks so far?\nSeeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,\nIn hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,\nAnd prove his merits to the throne of Troy?\nGrant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,\nThe partial monarch may refuse the prize;\nSons he has many; those thy pride may quell:\nAnd 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,\nOr, in reward of thy victorious hand,\nHas Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,\nAn ample forest, or a fair domain,\nOf hills for vines, and arable for grain?\nEven this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.\nBut can Achilles be so soon forgot?\nOnce (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear,\nAnd then the great \u00c6neas seem'd to fear:\nWith hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,\nNor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.\nHer lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;\nThose, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:\nIn Grecian chains her captive race were cast;\n'Tis true, the great \u00c6neas fled too fast.\nDefrauded of my conquest once before,\nWhat then I lost, the gods this day restore.\nGo; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\"\nTo this Anchises' son: \"Such words employ\nTo one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;\nSuch we disdain; the best may be defied\nWith mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;\nUnworthy the high race from which we came\nProclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame:\nEach from illustrious fathers draws his line;\nEach goddess-born; half human, half divine.\nThetis' this day, or Venus' offspring dies,\nAnd tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:\nFor when two heroes, thus derived, contend,\n'Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.",

The natives were content to till\nThe shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.[264]\nFrom Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,\nThe richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;\nThree thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,\nThree thousand foals beside their mothers fed.\nBoreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,\nConceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,\nWith voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,\nAnd coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:\nHence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,\nSwift as their mother mares, and father wind.\nThese lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,\nNor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;\nAnd when along the level seas they flew,[265]\nScarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.\nSuch Erichthonius was: from him there came\nThe sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.\nThree sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,\nIlus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:\nThe matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,\nWhom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,\nTo bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,\nThe grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).\nThe two remaining sons the line divide:\nFirst rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;\nFrom him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,\nAnd Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;\nClytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;\nAnd Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.\nFrom great Assaracus sprang Capys, he\nBegat Anchises, and Anchises me.\nSuch is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,\nBut Jove alone endues the soul with worth:\nHe, source of power and might! with boundless sway,\nAll human courage gives, or takes away.\nLong in the field of words we may contend,\nReproach is infinite, and knows no end,\nArm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;\nSo voluble a weapon is the tongue;\nWounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,\nFor every man has equal strength to rail:\nWomen alone, when in the streets they jar,\nPerhaps excel us in this wordy war;\nLike us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,\nAnd vent their anger impotent and loud.\nCease then\u2014Our business in the field of fight\nIs not to question, but to prove our might.\nTo all those insults thou hast offer'd here,\nReceive this answer: 'tis my flying spear.\"\nHe spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,\nFix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.\nFar on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held\n(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,\nThat trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear\nSaw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.\nHis fears were vain; impenetrable charms\nSecured the temper of the ethereal arms.\nThrough two strong plates the point its passage held,\nBut stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.\nFive plates of various metal, various mould,\nComposed the shield; of brass each outward fold,\nOf tin each inward, and the middle gold:\nThere stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,\nThe forceful spear of great Achilles flew,\nAnd pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,\nWhere the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:\nThrough the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,\nAnd the slight covering of expanded hides.\n\u00c6neas his contracted body bends,\nAnd o'er him high the riven targe extends,\nSees, through its parting plates, the upper air,\nAnd at his back perceives the quivering spear:\nA fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;\nAnd swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.\nAchilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,\nDraws his broad blade, and at \u00c6neas flies:\n\u00c6neas rousing as the foe came on,\nWith force collected, heaves a mighty stone:\nA mass enormous! which in modern days\nNo two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.\nBut ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground\nSaw the distress, and moved the powers around:\n\"Lo! on the brink of fate \u00c6neas stands,\nAn instant victim to Achilles' hands;\nBy Ph\u0153bus urged; but Ph\u0153bus has bestow'd\nHis aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.\nAnd can ye see this righteous chief atone\nWith guiltless blood for vices not his own?\nTo all the gods his constant vows were paid;\nSure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.\nFate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign\nThe future father of the Dardan line:[266]\nThe first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,\nAnd still his love descends on all the race:\nFor Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,\nAt length are odious to the all-seeing mind;\nOn great \u00c6neas shall devolve the reign,\nAnd sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.\"\nThe great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies\nThe imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:\n\"Good as he is, to immolate or spare\nThe Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;\nPallas and I, by all that gods can bind,\nHave sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;\nNot even an instant to protract their fate,\nOr save one member of the sinking state;\nTill her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,\nAnd even her crumbling ruins are no more.\"\nThe king of ocean to the fight descends,\nThrough all the whistling darts his course he bends,\nSwift interposed between the warrior flies,\nAnd casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.[267]\nFrom great \u00c6neas' shield the spear he drew,\nAnd at his master's feet the weapon threw.\nThat done, with force divine he snatch'd on high\nThe Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,\nSmooth-gliding without step, above the heads\nOf warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:\nTill at the battle's utmost verge they light,\nWhere the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.\nThe godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)\nWith words like these the panting chief address'd:\n\"What power, O prince! with force inferior far,\nUrged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?\nHenceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,\nDefrauding fate of all thy fame to come.\nBut when the day decreed (for come it must)\nShall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,\nLet then the furies of that arm be known,\nSecure no Grecian force transcends thy own.\"\nWith that, he left him wondering as he lay,\nThen from Achilles chased the mist away:\nSudden, returning with a stream of light,\nThe scene of war came rushing on his sight.\nThen thus, amazed; \"What wonders strike my mind!\nMy spear, that parted on the wings of wind,\nLaid here before me! and the Dardan lord,\nThat fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!\nI thought alone with mortals to contend,\nBut powers celestial sure this foe defend.\nGreat as he is, our arms he scarce will try,\nContent for once, with all his gods, to fly.\nNow then let others bleed.\" This said, aloud\nHe vents his fury and inflames the crowd:\n\"O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)\nJoin battle, man to man, and arms to arms!\n'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,\nTo mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:\nNo god can singly such a host engage,\nNot Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.\nBut whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,\nWhate'er of active force, or acting fire;\nWhate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;\nAll, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.\nThrough yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,\nAnd thin the squadrons with my single spear.\"\nHe said: nor less elate with martial joy,\nThe godlike Hector warm'd the troops of Troy:\n\"Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;\nNor dread the vaunts of Peleus' haughty son.\nDeeds must decide our fate. E'en these with words\nInsult the brave, who tremble at their swords:\nThe weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,\nBut shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.\nNor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,\nNot though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;\nThat fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,\nAnd brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand.\"\nThus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;\nA wood of lances rises round his head,\nClamours on clamours tempest all the air,\nThey join, they throng, they thicken to the war.\nBut Ph\u0153bus warns him from high heaven to shun\nThe single fight with Thetis' godlike son;\nMore safe to combat in the mingled band,\nNor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.\nHe hears, obedient to the god of light,\nAnd, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.",

the man on whom black fates attend;\nThe man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!\nNo more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear\nTurn from each other in the walks of war.\"\u2014\nThen with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:\n\"Come, and receive thy fate!\" He spake no more.\nHector, undaunted, thus: \"Such words employ\nTo one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:\nSuch we could give, defying and defied,\nMean intercourse of obloquy and pride!\nI know thy force to mine superior far;\nBut heaven alone confers success in war:\nMean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,\nAnd give it entrance in a braver heart.\"\nThen parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath\nFar from Achilles wafts the winged death:\nThe bidden dart again to Hector flies,\nAnd at the feet of its great master lies.\nAchilles closes with his hated foe,\nHis heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:\nBut present to his aid, Apollo shrouds\nThe favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.\nThrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,\nThrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;\nThe spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.\nHe foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:\n\"Wretch!

no prayer, no moving art,\nE'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!\nWhile yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,\nThe ruthless falchion oped his tender side;\nThe panting liver pours a flood of gore\nThat drowns his bosom till he pants no more.\nThrough Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:\nThe warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.\nThy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,\nDeep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;\nWarm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,\nThe purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.\nThen brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung\nWhere the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;\nHe dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,\nAnd stood all impotent, expecting fate:\nFull on his neck the falling falchion sped,\nFrom his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head:\nForth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,\nAnd, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.\nRhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,\n(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)\nSucceeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;\nProne from his car the thundering chief descends.\nThe squire, who saw expiring on the ground\nHis prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;\nHis back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored,\nAnd stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.\nAs when a flame the winding valley fills,\nAnd runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;\nThen o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,\nFires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,\nThis way and that, the spreading torrent roars:\nSo sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;\nAround him wide, immense destruction pours\nAnd earth is deluged with the sanguine showers,\nAs with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,\nAnd thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor;\nWhen round and round, with never-wearied pain,\nThe trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:\nSo the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,\nTread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,\nDash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,\nBlack, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:\nThe spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;\nAnd thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.\nHigh o'er the scene of death Achilles stood,\nAll grim with dust, all horrible in blood:",

'tis my doom to die!\nIf ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,\nAh! think not me too much of Hector's kind!\nNot the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,\nWith his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death.\"\nThese words, attended with a shower of tears,\nThe youth address'd to unrelenting ears:\n\"Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):\nPatroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:\nIn vain a single Trojan sues for grace;\nBut least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.\nDie then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?\nThe great, the good Patroclus is no more!\nHe, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,\nAnd thou, dost thou bewail mortality?\nSeest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,\nSprung from a hero, from a goddess born?\nThe day shall come (which nothing can avert)\nWhen by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,\nBy night, or day, by force, or by design,\nImpending death and certain fate are mine!\nDie then,\"\u2014He said; and as the word he spoke,\nThe fainting stripling sank before the stroke:\nHis hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,\nWhile all his trembling frame confess'd his fear:\nSudden, Achilles his broad sword display'd,\nAnd buried in his neck the reeking blade.\nProne fell the youth; and panting on the land,\nThe gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.\nThe victor to the stream the carcase gave,\nAnd thus insults him, floating on the wave:\n\"Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround\nThy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:\nThere no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,\nBut swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,\nWhose every wave some watery monster brings,\nTo feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.\nSo perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!\nSuch ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.\nWhat boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream,\nHis earthly honours, and immortal name?\nIn vain your immolated bulls are slain,\nYour living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!\nThus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;\nThus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:\nThus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade,\nAnd the short absence of Achilles paid.\"",

Unhappy is the sire\nWhose son encounters our resistless ire.\"\n\"O son of Peleus! what avails to trace\n(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?\nFrom rich Paeonia's valleys I command,\nArm'd with protended spears, my native band;\nNow shines the tenth bright morning since I came\nIn aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:\nAxius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,\nAnd wide around the floated region fills,\nBegot my sire, whose spear much glory won:\nNow lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!\"\nThreatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;\nAt once Asteropeus discharged each lance,\n(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)\nOne struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;\nOne razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood\nSpun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.\nLike lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:\nIts erring fury hiss'd along the skies;\nDeep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,\nEven to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.\nThen from his side the sword Pelides drew,\nAnd on his foe with double fury flew.\nThe foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood;\nRepulsive of his might the weapon stood:\nThe fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;\nBent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;\nHis belly open'd with a ghastly wound,\nThe reeking entrails pour upon the ground.\nBeneath the hero's feet he panting lies,\nAnd his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;\nWhile the proud victor thus triumphing said,\nHis radiant armour tearing from the dead:\n\"So ends thy glory!

(for the gods are thine)\nIn valour matchless, and in force divine!\nIf Jove have given thee every Trojan head,\n'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.\nSee! my choked streams no more their course can keep,\nNor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.\nTurn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;\nContent, thy slaughters could amaze a god.\"\nIn human form, confess'd before his eyes,\nThe river thus; and thus the chief replies:\n\"O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;\nBut not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,\nNot till within her towers the perjured train\nShall pant, and tremble at our arms again;\nNot till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,\nOr stain this lance, or see Achilles fall.\"\nHe said; and drove with fury on the foe.\nThen to the godhead of the silver bow\nThe yellow flood began: \"O son of Jove!\nWas not the mandate of the sire above\nFull and express, that Ph\u0153bus should employ\nHis sacred arrows in defence of Troy,\nAnd make her conquer, till Hyperion's fall\nIn awful darkness hide the face of all?\"\nHe spoke in vain\u2014The chief without dismay\nPloughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.\nThen rising in his rage above the shores,\nFrom all his deep the bellowing river roars,\nHuge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,\nAnd round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.\nWhile all before, the billows ranged on high,\n(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.\nNow bursting on his head with thundering sound,\nThe falling deluge whelms the hero round:\nHis loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;\nHis feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,\nSliddering, and staggering.

The large trunk display'd\nBridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd\nOn this his weight, and raised upon his hand,\nLeap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.\nThen blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:\nThe god pursues, a huger billow throws,\nAnd bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy\nThe man whose fury is the fate of Troy.\nHe like the warlike eagle speeds his pace\n(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);\nFar as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;\nAt every bound his clanging armour rings:\nNow here, now there, he turns on every side,\nAnd winds his course before the following tide;\nThe waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,\nAnd gather fast, and murmur at his heels.\nSo when a peasant to his garden brings\nSoft rills of water from the bubbling springs,\nAnd calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,\nAnd feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:\nSoon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,\nAnd marks the future current with his spade,\nSwift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,\nLouder and louder purl the falling rills;\nBefore him scattering, they prevent his pains,\nAnd shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.\nStill flies Achilles, but before his eyes\nStill swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:\nNot all his speed escapes the rapid floods;\nThe first of men, but not a match for gods.\nOft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,\nAnd bravely try if all the powers were foes;\nSo oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,\nBeats on his back, or bursts upon his head.\nYet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,\nAnd still indignant bounds above the waves.\nTired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;\nWash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;\nWhen thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)\nForth bursts the hero with an angry groan:\n\"Is there no god Achilles to befriend,\nNo power to avert his miserable end?\nPrevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,[271]\nAnd make my future life the sport of fate.\nOf all heaven's oracles believed in vain,\nBut most of Thetis must her son complain;\nBy Ph\u0153bus' darts she prophesied my fall,\nIn glorious arms before the Trojan wall.\nOh! had I died in fields of battle warm,\nStretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!\nMight Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,\nAnd my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.\nAh no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,\nOh how unworthy of the brave and great!\nLike some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,\nCrossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,\nAn unregarded carcase to the sea.\"\nNeptune and Pallas haste to his relief,\nAnd thus in human form address'd the chief:\nThe power of ocean first: \"Forbear thy fear,\nO son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!\nBehold! from Jove descending to thy aid,\nPropitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.\nStay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave\n'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.\nBut thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!\nNor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,\nTill Troy receive her flying sons, till all\nHer routed squadrons pant behind their wall:\nHector alone shall stand his fatal chance,\nAnd Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.\nThine is the glory doom'd.\" Thus spake the gods:\nThen swift ascended to the bright abodes.\nStung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,\nHe springs impetuous, and invades the field:\nO'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;\nHeaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,\nFloating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold\nAnd turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.\nHigh o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,\nHe wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.\nNot a whole river stops the hero's course,\nWhile Pallas fills him with immortal force.\nWith equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,\nAnd lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.\nThen thus to Simois! \"Haste, my brother flood;\nAnd check this mortal that controls a god;\nOur bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,\nAnd Ilion tumble from her towery height.\nCall then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,\nFrom all thy fountains swell thy watery store,\nWith broken rocks, and with a load of dead,\nCharge the black surge, and pour it on his head.\nMark how resistless through the floods he goes,\nAnd boldly bids the warring gods be foes!\nBut nor that force, nor form divine to sight,\nShall aught avail him, if our rage unite:\nWhelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,\nThat blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;\nAnd deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,\nImmersed remain this terror of the world.\nSuch ponderous ruin shall confound the place,",

With feeble pace,\nAnd settled sorrow on his aged face,\nFast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;\nAnd thus descending, on the guards he calls:\n\"You to whose care our city-gates belong,\nSet wide your portals to the flying throng:\nFor lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;\nHe comes, and desolation marks his way!\nBut when within the walls our troops take breath,\nLock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.\"\nThus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung\nThe opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.\nPh\u0153bus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;\nStruck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,\nOn heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,\nAnd gladsome see their last escape from fate.\nThither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,\nHoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:\nAnd gasping, panting, fainting, labour on\nWith heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.\nEnraged Achilles follows with his spear;\nWild with revenge, insatiable of war.\nThen had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,\nAnd Troy inglorious to her walls retired;\nBut he, the god who darts ethereal flame,\nShot down to save her, and redeem her fame:\nTo young Agenor force divine he gave;\n(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)\nIn aid of him, beside the beech he sate,\nAnd wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.\nWhen now the generous youth Achilles spies,\nThick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.\n(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)\nHe stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;\n\"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!\nLike others fly, and be like others slain?\nVain hope! to shun him by the self-same road\nYon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.\nNo: with the common heap I scorn to fall\u2014\nWhat if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,\nWhile I decline to yonder path, that leads\nTo Ida's forests and surrounding shades?\nSo may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,\nFrom my tired body wash the dirt and blood,\nAs soon as night her dusky veil extends,\nReturn in safety to my Trojan friends.\nWhat if?\u2014But wherefore all this vain debate?\nStand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?\nEven now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,\nThe fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:\nSuch is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,\nAnd such his valour, that who stands must die.\nHowe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,\nHere, and in public view, to meet my fate.\nYet sure he too is mortal; he may feel\n(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.\nOne only soul informs that dreadful frame:\nAnd Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame.\"\nHe said, and stood, collected, in his might;\nAnd all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.\nSo from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,\nRoused from his thicket by a storm of darts:\nUntaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds\nOf shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;\nThough struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;\nAnd the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:\nOn their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;\nAnd tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.\nNot less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir\nConfronts Achilles, and awaits the war,\nDisdainful of retreat: high held before,\nHis shield (a broad circumference) he bore;\nThen graceful as he stood, in act to throw\nThe lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:\n\"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!\nAnd hopes this day to sink the Trojan name\nBeneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;\nA thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.\nParents and children our just arms employ,\nAnd strong and many are the sons of Troy.\nGreat as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore\nThese Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.\"\nHe said: with matchless force the javelin flung\nSmote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung\nBeneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms\nHe stands impassive in the ethereal arms.\nThen fiercely rushing on the daring foe,\nHis lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:\nBut, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds\nThe god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.\nSafe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,\nDismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.\nMeanwhile the god, to cover their escape,\nAssumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,\nFlies from the furious chief in this disguise;\nThe furious chief still follows where he flies.\nNow o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,\nNow urge the course where swift Scamander glides:\nThe god, now distant scarce a stride before,\nTempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;\nWhile all the flying troops their speed employ,\nAnd pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:\nNo stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,\nWho 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.\n'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;\nAnd sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.\nPale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:",

Then let my foe\nDraw near, but first his certain fortune know;\nSecure this hand shall his whole frame confound,\nMash all his bones, and all his body pound:\nSo let his friends be nigh, a needful train,\nTo heave the batter'd carcase off the plain.\"\nThe giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze\nThe host beheld him, silent with amaze!\n'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire\nTo meet his might, and emulate thy sire,\nThe great Mecistheus; who in days of yore\nIn Theban games the noblest trophy bore,\n(The games ordain'd dead OEdipus to grace,)\nAnd singly vanquish the Cadmean race.\nHim great Tydides urges to contend,\nWarm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;\nOfficious with the cincture girds him round;\nAnd to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.\nAmid the circle now each champion stands,\nAnd poises high in air his iron hands;\nWith clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,\nTheir crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,\nAnd painful sweat from all their members flows.\nAt length Epeus dealt a weighty blow\nFull on the cheek of his unwary foe;\nBeneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway\nDown dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.\nAs a large fish, when winds and waters roar,\nBy some huge billow dash'd against the shore,\nLies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,\nThe bleeding hero pants upon the ground.\nTo rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,\nScornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;\nWhose arms support him, reeling through the throng,\nAnd dragging his disabled legs along;\nNodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er;\nHis mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;[292]\nWrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;\nHis friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.\nThe third bold game Achilles next demands,\nAnd calls the wrestlers to the level sands:\nA massy tripod for the victor lies,\nOf twice six oxen its reputed price;\nAnd next, the loser's spirits to restore,\nA female captive, valued but at four.\nScarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose\nWhen tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.\nAmid the ring each nervous rival stands,\nEmbracing rigid with implicit hands.\nClose lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:\nBelow, their planted feet at distance fix'd;\nLike two strong rafters which the builder forms,\nProof to the wintry winds and howling storms,\nTheir tops connected, but at wider space\nFix'd on the centre stands their solid base.\nNow to the grasp each manly body bends;\nThe humid sweat from every pore descends;\nTheir bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs\nSwell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.\nNor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,\nO'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;\nNor could the strength of Ajax overthrow\nThe watchful caution of his artful foe.\nWhile the long strife even tired the lookers on,\nThus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:\n\"Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:\nProve we our force, and Jove the rest decree.\"\nHe said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground\nWith matchless strength; that time Ulysses found\nThe strength to evade, and where the nerves combine\nHis ankle struck: the giant fell supine;\nUlysses, following, on his bosom lies;\nShouts of applause run rattling through the skies.\nAjax to lift Ulysses next essays;\nHe barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:\nHis knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;\nAnd grappling close, they tumbled side by side.\nDefiled with honourable dust they roll,\nStill breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:\nAgain they rage, again to combat rise;\nWhen great Achilles thus divides the prize:\n\"Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;\nNor weary out your generous strength in vain.\nYe both have won: let others who excel,\nNow prove that prowess you have proved so well.\"\nThe hero's words the willing chiefs obey,\nFrom their tired bodies wipe the dust away,\nAnd, clothed anew, the following games survey.\nAnd now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace\nThe youths contending in the rapid race:\nA silver urn that full six measures held,\nBy none in weight or workmanship excell'd:\nSidonian artists taught the frame to shine,\nElaborate, with artifice divine;\nWhence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,\nAnd gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:\nFrom him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd\nThe glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,\nTo brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:\nNow, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,\nIt stands the prize of swiftness in the race.\nA well-fed ox was for the second placed;\nAnd half a talent must content the last.\nAchilles rising then bespoke the train:\n\"Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,\nStand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain.\"\nThe hero said, and starting from his place,\nOilean Ajax rises to the race;\nUlysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd\nHis youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.\nRanged in a line the ready racers stand;\nPelides points the barrier with his hand;\nAll start at once; O\u00efleus led the race;\nThe next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;\nBehind him, diligently close, he sped,\nAs closely following as the running thread\nThe spindle follows, and displays the charms\nOf the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:\nGraceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,\nAnd treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;\nHis glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:\nThe admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:\nTo him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,\nAnd send their souls before him as he flies.\nNow three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,\nThe panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:\n\"Assist, O goddess!\" thus in thought he pray'd!\nAnd present at his thought descends the maid.\nBuoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,\nAnd feels a pinion lifting every limb.\nAll fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,\nUnhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain\n(O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore\nWas clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.\n(The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,\nWhere late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)\nBesmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,\nObscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;\nThe well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,\nAnd left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.\nThen, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,\nThe baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:\n\"Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;\nA mortal I, a goddess was my foe;\nShe urged her favourite on the rapid way,\nAnd Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day.\"\nThus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;\nA burst of laughter echoed through the shore.\nAntilochus, more humorous than the rest,\nTakes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:\n\"Why with our wiser elders should we strive?\nThe gods still love them, and they always thrive.\nYe see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:\nHe to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;\n(A green old age unconscious of decays,\nThat proves the hero born in better days!)\nBehold his vigour in this active race!\nAchilles only boasts a swifter pace:\nFor who can match Achilles? He who can,\nMust yet be more than hero, more than man.\"\nThe effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,\n\"Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.\nNor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;\nReceive a talent of the purest gold.\"\nThe youth departs content. The host admire\nThe son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.\nNext these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;\nCast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:\nArms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,\nAnd great Patroclus in short triumph bore.\n\"Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)\nWhoever dares deserve so rich a prize,\nNow grace the lists before our army's sight,\nAnd sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.\nWho first the jointed armour shall explore,\nAnd stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,\nThe sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old,\n(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)\nShall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side:\nThese arms in common let the chiefs divide:\nFor each brave champion, when the combat ends,\nA sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.\"\nFierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son,\nAnd the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.\nClad in refulgent steel, on either hand,\nThe dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;\nLouring they meet, tremendous to the sight;\nEach Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.\nOpposed in arms not long they idly stood,\nBut thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.\nA furious pass the spear of Ajax made\nThrough the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.\nNot thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above\nThe buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.\nBut Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,\nBade share the honours, and surcease the strife.\nYet still the victor's due Tydides gains,\nWith him the sword and studded belt remains.\nThen hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground,\nA mass of iron (an enormous round),\nWhose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,\nRude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.\nThis mighty quoit A\u00ebtion wont to rear,\nAnd from his whirling arm dismiss in air;\nThe giant by Achilles slain, he stow'd\nAmong his spoils this memorable load.\nFor this, he bids those nervous artists vie,\nThat teach the disk to sound along the sky.\n\"Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;\nWho farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;\nIf he be one enrich'd with large domain\nOf downs for flocks, and arable for grain,\nSmall stock of iron needs that man provide;\nHis hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied\nFrom hence; nor ask the neighbouring city's aid\nFor ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.\"\nStern Polyp\u0153tes stepp'd before the throng,\nAnd great Leonteus, more than mortal strong;\nWhose force with rival forces to oppose,\nUprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.\nEach stood in order: first Epeus threw;\nHigh o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.\nLeonteus next a little space surpass'd;\nAnd third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.\nO'er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung\nFrom Polyp\u0153tes' arm the discus sung:\nFar as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,\nThat distant falls among the grazing cows,\nSo past them all the rapid circle flies:\nHis friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,\nWith force conjoin'd heave off the weighty prize.\nThose, who in skilful archery contend,\nHe next invites the twanging bow to bend;\nAnd twice ten axes casts amidst the round,\nTen double-edged, and ten that singly wound\nThe mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,\nThe hero fixes in the sandy shore;\nTo the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,\nThe trembling mark at which their arrows fly.\n\"Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear\nThese two-edged axes, terrible in war;\nThe single, he whose shaft divides the cord.\"\nHe said: experienced Merion took the word;\nAnd skilful Teucer: in the helm they threw\nTheir lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.\nSwift from the string the sounding arrow flies;\nBut flies unbless'd! No grateful sacrifice,\nNo firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow\nTo Ph\u0153bus, patron of the shaft and bow.\nFor this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,\nErr'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:\nAdown the mainmast fell the parted string,\nAnd the free bird to heaven displays her wing:\nSea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,\nAnd Merion eager meditates the wound:\nHe takes the bow, directs the shaft above,\nAnd following with his eye the soaring dove,\nImplores the god to speed it through the skies,\nWith vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice,\nThe dove, in airy circles as she wheels,\nAmid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;\nQuite through and through the point its passage found,\nAnd at his feet fell bloody to the ground.\nThe wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,\nWith flagging wings alighted on the mast,\nA moment hung, and spread her pinions there,\nThen sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.\nFrom the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,\nAnd to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.\nTo close the funeral games, Achilles last\nA massy spear amid the circle placed,\nAnd ample charger of unsullied frame,\nWith flowers high-wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame.\nFor these he bids the heroes prove their art,\nWhose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.\nHere too great Merion hopes the noble prize;\nNor here disdain'd the king of men to rise.\nWith joy Pelides saw the honour paid,\nRose to the monarch, and respectful said:\n\"Thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,\nO king of nations! all thy Greeks proclaim;\nIn every martial game thy worth attest,\nAnd know thee both their greatest and their best.\nTake then the prize, but let brave Merion bear\nThis beamy javelin in thy brother's war.\"\nPleased from the hero's lips his praise to hear,\nThe king to Merion gives the brazen spear:\nBut, set apart for sacred use, commands\nThe glittering charger to Talthybius' hands.",

(thus the vision said:)\nNow dost thou sleep, when Hector is restored?\nNor fear the Grecian foes, or Grecian lord?\nThy presence here should stern Atrides see,\nThy still surviving sons may sue for thee;\nMay offer all thy treasures yet contain,\nTo spare thy age; and offer all in vain.\"\nWaked with the word the trembling sire arose,\nAnd raised his friend: the god before him goes:\nHe joins the mules, directs them with his hand,\nAnd moves in silence through the hostile land.\nWhen now to Xanthus' yellow stream they drove,\n(Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove,)\nThe winged deity forsook their view,\nAnd in a moment to Olympus flew.\nNow shed Aurora round her saffron ray,\nSprang through the gates of light, and gave the day:\nCharged with the mournful load, to Ilion go\nThe sage and king, majestically slow.\nCassandra first beholds, from Ilion's spire,\nThe sad procession of her hoary sire;\nThen, as the pensive pomp advanced more near,\n(Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,)\nA shower of tears o'erflows her beauteous eyes,\nAlarming thus all Ilion with her cries:\n\"Turn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,\nYe wretched daughters, and ye sons of Troy!\nIf e'er ye rush'd in crowds, with vast delight,\nTo hail your hero glorious from the fight,\nNow meet him dead, and let your sorrows flow;\nYour common triumph, and your common woe.\"\nIn thronging crowds they issue to the plains;\nNor man nor woman in the walls remains;\nIn every face the self-same grief is shown;\nAnd Troy sends forth one universal groan.\nAt Sc\u00e6a's gates they meet the mourning wain,\nHang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.\nThe wife and mother, frantic with despair,\nKiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter'd hair:\nThus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay;\nAnd there had sigh'd and sorrow'd out the day;\nBut godlike Priam from the chariot rose:\n\"Forbear (he cried) this violence of woes;\nFirst to the palace let the car proceed,\nThen pour your boundless sorrows o'er the dead.\"\nThe waves of people at his word divide,\nSlow rolls the chariot through the following tide;\nEven to the palace the sad pomp they wait:\nThey weep, and place him on the bed of state.\nA melancholy choir attend around,\nWith plaintive sighs, and music's solemn sound:\nAlternately they sing, alternate flow\nThe obedient tears, melodious in their woe.\nWhile deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,\nAnd nature speaks at every pause of art.\nFirst to the corse the weeping consort flew;\nAround his neck her milk-white arms she threw,\n\"And oh, my Hector! Oh, my lord!
