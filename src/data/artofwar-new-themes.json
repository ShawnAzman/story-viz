If\nyou lay siege to a town, you will exhaust your strength.\n3. Again, if the campaign is protracted, the resources of the State\nwill not be equal to the strain.\n4. Now, when your weapons are dulled, your ardour damped, your strength\nexhausted and your treasure spent, other chieftains will spring up to\ntake advantage of your extremity. Then no man, however wise, will be\nable to avert the consequences that must ensue.\n5. Thus, though we have heard of stupid haste in war, cleverness has\nnever been seen associated with long delays.\n[This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of\nthe commentators. Ts'ao Kung, Li Ch'uan, Meng Shih, Tu Yu, Tu Mu and\nMei Yao-ch'en have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally\nstupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. Ho\nShih says: \"Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure\nof energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but\nthey bring calamity in their train.\" Wang Hsi evades the difficulty by\nremarking: \"Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being\nexpended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true\ncleverness insures against the occurrence of such calamities.\" Chang Yu\nsays: \"So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable\nto clever dilatoriness.\" Now Sun Tz\u016d says nothing whatever, except\npossibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than\ningenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much\nmore guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious,\ntardiness can never be anything but foolish\u2014if only because it means\nimpoverishment to the nation. In considering the point raised here by\nSun Tz\u016d, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur\nto the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome\nagainst that of Hannibals's isolated army, because it seemed to him\nthat the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a\nstrange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics\nwould have proved successful in the long run. Their reversal it is\ntrue, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption\nin their favour.]",

This is called hobbling the army.\n[Li Ch'uan adds the comment: \"It is like tying together the legs of a\nthoroughbred, so that it is unable to gallop.\" One would naturally\nthink of \"the ruler\" in this passage as being at home, and trying to\ndirect the movements of his army from a distance. But the commentators\nunderstand just the reverse, and quote the saying of T'ai Kung: \"A\nkingdom should not be governed from without, and army should not be\ndirected from within.\" Of course it is true that, during an engagement,\nor when in close touch with the enemy, the general should not be in the\nthick of his own troops, but a little distance apart. Otherwise, he\nwill be liable to misjudge the position as a whole, and give wrong\norders.]\n14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same way as he\nadministers a kingdom, being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in\nan army. This causes restlessness in the soldier's minds.\n[Ts'ao Kung's note is, freely translated: \"The military sphere and the\ncivil sphere are wholly distinct; you can't handle an army in kid\ngloves.\" And Chang Yu says: \"Humanity and justice are the principles on\nwhich to govern a state, but not an army; opportunism and flexibility,\non the other hand, are military rather than civil virtues to assimilate\nthe governing of an army\"\u2014to that of a State, understood.]\n15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without discrimination,\n[That is, he is not careful to use the right man in the right place.]\nthrough ignorance of the military principle of adaptation to\ncircumstances. This shakes the confidence of the soldiers.\n[I follow Mei Yao-ch'en here. The other commentators refer not to the\nruler, as in \u00a7\u00a7 13, 14, but to the officers he employs. Thus Tu Yu\nsays: \"If a general is ignorant of the principle of adaptability, he\nmust not be entrusted with a position of authority.\" Tu Mu quotes: \"The\nskilful employer of men will employ the wise man, the brave man, the\ncovetous man, and the stupid man. For the wise man delights in\nestablishing his merit, the brave man likes to show his courage in\naction, the covetous man is quick at seizing advantages, and the stupid\nman has no fear of death.\"]\n16.

Chang Yu expounds the\nsaying more satisfactorily: \"By applying the art of war, it is possible\nwith a lesser force to defeat a greater, and _vice versa_. The secret\nlies in an eye for locality, and in not letting the right moment slip.\nThus Wu Tz\u016d says: 'With a superior force, make for easy ground; with an\ninferior one, make for difficult ground.'\"]\n(3) He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout\nall its ranks.\n(4) He will win who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy\nunprepared.\n(5) He will win who has military capacity and is not interfered with by\nthe sovereign.\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz\u016d as saying: \"It is the sovereign's function to\ngive broad instructions, but to decide on battle it is the function of\nthe general.\" It is needless to dilate on the military disasters which\nhave been caused by undue interference with operations in the field on\nthe part of the home government.

To see victory only when it is within the ken of the common herd is\nnot the acme of excellence.\n[As Ts'ao Kung remarks, \"the thing is to see the plant before it has\ngerminated,\" to foresee the event before the action has begun. Li\nCh'uan alludes to the story of Han Hsin who, when about to attack the\nvastly superior army of Chao, which was strongly entrenched in the city\nof Ch'eng-an, said to his officers: \"Gentlemen, we are going to\nannihilate the enemy, and shall meet again at dinner.\" The officers\nhardly took his words seriously, and gave a very dubious assent. But\nHan Hsin had already worked out in his mind the details of a clever\nstratagem, whereby, as he foresaw, he was able to capture the city and\ninflict a crushing defeat on his adversary.\"]\n9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and conquer and\nthe whole Empire says, \"Well done!\"\n[True excellence being, as Tu Mu says: \"To plan secretly, to move\nsurreptitiously, to foil the enemy's intentions and balk his schemes,\nso that at last the day may be won without shedding a drop of blood.\"\nSun Tz\u016d reserves his approbation for things that\n\"the world's coarse thumb\nAnd finger fail to plumb.\"\n10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;\n[\"Autumn hair\" is explained as the fur of a hare, which is finest in\nautumn, when it begins to grow afresh. The phrase is a very common one\nin Chinese writers.]\nto see sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to hear the noise of\nthunder is no sign of a quick ear.\n[Ho Shih gives as real instances of strength, sharp sight and quick\nhearing: Wu Huo, who could lift a tripod weighing 250 stone; Li Chu,\nwho at a distance of a hundred paces could see objects no bigger than a\nmustard seed; and Shih K'uang, a blind musician who could hear the\nfootsteps of a mosquito.]\n11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who not only wins,\nbut excels in winning with ease.\n[The last half is literally \"one who, conquering, excels in easy\nconquering.\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \"He who only sees the obvious, wins\nhis battles with difficulty; he who looks below the surface of things,\nwins with ease.\"]\n12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for wisdom nor\ncredit for courage.\n[Tu Mu explains this very well: \"Inasmuch as his victories are gained\nover circumstances that have not come to light, the world as large\nknows nothing of them, and he wins no reputation for wisdom; inasmuch\nas the hostile state submits before there has been any bloodshed, he\nreceives no credit for courage.\"]",

In respect of military method, we have, firstly, Measurement;\nsecondly, Estimation of quantity; thirdly, Calculation; fourthly,\nBalancing of chances; fifthly, Victory.\n18. Measurement owes its existence to Earth; Estimation of quantity to\nMeasurement; Calculation to Estimation of quantity; Balancing of\nchances to Calculation; and Victory to Balancing of chances.\n[It is not easy to distinguish the four terms very clearly in the\nChinese. The first seems to be surveying and measurement of the ground,\nwhich enable us to form an estimate of the enemy's strength, and to\nmake calculations based on the data thus obtained; we are thus led to a\ngeneral weighing-up, or comparison of the enemy's chances with our own;\nif the latter turn the scale, then victory ensues. The chief difficulty\nlies in third term, which in the Chinese some commentators take as a\ncalculation of _numbers_, thereby making it nearly synonymous with the\nsecond term. Perhaps the second term should be thought of as a\nconsideration of the enemy's general position or condition, while the\nthird term is the estimate of his numerical strength. On the other\nhand, Tu Mu says: \"The question of relative strength having been\nsettled, we can bring the varied resources of cunning into play.\" Ho\nShih seconds this interpretation, but weakens it.

Chia Lin: \"In presence of the enemy, your\ntroops should be arrayed in normal fashion, but in order to secure\nvictory abnormal man\u0153uvers must be employed.\" Mei Yao-ch'en: \"_Ch'i_ is\nactive, _cheng_ is passive; passivity means waiting for an opportunity,\nactivity brings the victory itself.\" Ho Shih: \"We must cause the enemy\nto regard our straightforward attack as one that is secretly designed,\nand vice versa; thus _cheng_ may also be _ch'i_, and _ch'i_ may also be\n_cheng_.\" He instances the famous exploit of Han Hsin, who when\nmarching ostensibly against Lin-chin (now Chao-i in Shensi), suddenly\nthrew a large force across the Yellow River in wooden tubs, utterly\ndisconcerting his opponent. [Ch'ien Han Shu, ch. 3.] Here, we are told,\nthe march on Lin-chin was _cheng_, and the surprise man\u0153uver was\n_ch'i_.\" Chang Yu gives the following summary of opinions on the words:\n\"Military writers do not agree with regard to the meaning of _ch'i_ and\n_cheng_. Wei Liao Tz\u016d [4th cent. B.C.] says: 'Direct warfare favours\nfrontal attacks, indirect warfare attacks from the rear.' Ts'ao Kung\nsays: 'Going straight out to join battle is a direct operation;\nappearing on the enemy's rear is an indirect man\u0153uver.' Li Wei-kung\n[6th and 7th cent. A.D.] says: 'In war, to march straight ahead is\n_cheng_; turning movements, on the other hand, are _ch'i_.' These\nwriters simply regard _cheng_ as _cheng_, and _ch'i_ as _ch'i_; they do\nnot note that the two are mutually interchangeable and run into each\nother like the two sides of a circle [see infra, \u00a7 11]. A comment on\nthe T'ang Emperor T'ai Tsung goes to the root of the matter: 'A _ch'i_\nman\u0153uver may be _cheng_, if we make the enemy look upon it as _cheng_;\nthen our real attack will be _ch'i_, and vice versa. The whole secret\nlies in confusing the enemy, so that he cannot fathom our real\nintent.'\" To put it perhaps a little more clearly: any attack or other\noperation is _cheng_, on which the enemy has had his attention fixed;\nwhereas that is _ch'i_,\" which takes him by surprise or comes from an\nunexpected quarter. If the enemy perceives a movement which is meant to\nbe _ch'i_,\" it immediately becomes _cheng_.\"]",

Sun Pin said: \"The\nCh'i State has a reputation for cowardice, and therefore our adversary\ndespises us.

P'ang Chuan pursued them hotly, saying to\nhimself: \"I knew these men of Ch'i were cowards: their numbers have\nalready fallen away by more than half.\" In his retreat, Sun Pin came to\na narrow defile, which he calculated that his pursuers would reach\nafter dark. Here he had a tree stripped of its bark, and inscribed upon\nit the words: \"Under this tree shall P'ang Chuan die.\" Then, as night\nbegan to fall, he placed a strong body of archers in ambush near by,\nwith orders to shoot directly if they saw a light. Later on, P'ang\nChuan arrived at the spot, and noticing the tree, struck a light in\norder to read what was written on it. His body was immediately riddled\nby a volley of arrows, and his whole army thrown into confusion.

This unexpected proceeding had the\nintended effect; for Ssu-ma I, suspecting an ambush, actually drew off\nhis army and retreated.

We can form a single united body, while the enemy must split up\ninto fractions. Hence there will be a whole pitted against separate\nparts of a whole, which means that we shall be many to the enemy's few.\n15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force with a superior\none, our opponents will be in dire straits.\n16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made known; for then\nthe enemy will have to prepare against a possible attack at several\ndifferent points;\n[Sheridan once explained the reason of General Grant's victories by\nsaying that \"while his opponents were kept fully employed wondering\nwhat he was going to do, _he_ was thinking most of what he was going to\ndo himself.\"]\nand his forces being thus distributed in many directions, the numbers\nwe shall have to face at any given point will be proportionately few.\n17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will weaken his rear;\nshould he strengthen his rear, he will weaken his van; should he\nstrengthen his left, he will weaken his right; should he strengthen his\nright, he will weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements everywhere,\nhe will everywhere be weak.\n[In Frederick the Great's _Instructions to his Generals_ we read: \"A\ndefensive war is apt to betray us into too frequent detachment. Those\ngenerals who have had but little experience attempt to protect every\npoint, while those who are better acquainted with their profession,\nhaving only the capital object in view, guard against a decisive blow,\nand acquiesce in small misfortunes to avoid greater.\"]\n18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare against possible\nattacks; numerical strength, from compelling our adversary to make\nthese preparations against us.\n[The highest generalship, in Col. Henderson's words, is \"to compel the\nenemy to disperse his army, and then to concentrate superior force\nagainst each fraction in turn.\"]\n19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming battle, we may\nconcentrate from the greatest distances in order to fight.\n[What Sun Tz\u016d evidently has in mind is that nice calculation of\ndistances and that masterly employment of strategy which enable a\ngeneral to divide his army for the purpose of a long and rapid march,\nand afterwards to effect a junction at precisely the right spot and the\nright hour in order to confront the enemy in overwhelming strength.\nAmong many such successful junctions which military history records,\none of the most dramatic and decisive was the appearance of Blucher\njust at the critical moment on the field of Waterloo.]\n20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left wing will be\nimpotent to succour the right, the right equally impotent to succour the\nleft, the van unable to relieve the rear, or the rear to support the\nvan. How much more so if the furthest portions of the army are anything\nunder a hundred _li_ apart, and even the nearest are separated by\nseveral _li_!\n[The Chinese of this last sentence is a little lacking in precision,\nbut the mental picture we are required to draw is probably that of an\narmy advancing towards a given rendezvous in separate columns, each of\nwhich has orders to be there on a fixed date. If the general allows the\nvarious detachments to proceed at haphazard, without precise\ninstructions as to the time and place of meeting, the enemy will be\nable to annihilate the army in detail. Chang Yu's note may be worth\nquoting here: \"If we do not know the place where our opponents mean to\nconcentrate or the day on which they will join battle, our unity will\nbe forfeited through our preparations for defence, and the positions we\nhold will be insecure. Suddenly happening upon a powerful foe, we shall\nbe brought to battle in a flurried condition, and no mutual support\nwill be possible between wings, vanguard or rear, especially if there\nis any great distance between the foremost and hindmost divisions of\nthe army.\"]",

The Ch'in general was overjoyed, and attributed his\nadversary's tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the\nHan State, and thus not actually part of Chao territory.

I submit my own rendering\nwithout much enthusiasm, being convinced that there is some deep-seated\ncorruption in the text. On the whole, it is clear that Sun Tz\u016d does not\napprove of a lengthy march being undertaken without supplies. Cf.\ninfra, \u00a7 11.]\n7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-coats, and make\nforced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual\ndistance at a stretch,\n[The ordinary day's march, according to Tu Mu, was 30 _li_; but on one\noccasion, when pursuing Liu Pei, Ts'ao Ts'ao is said to have covered\nthe incredible distance of 300 _li_ within twenty-four hours.]\ndoing a hundred _li_ in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all\nyour three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.\n8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind,\nand on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its\ndestination.\n[The moral is, as Ts'ao Kung and others point out: Don't march a\nhundred _li_ to gain a tactical advantage, either with or without\nimpedimenta. Man\u0153uvers of this description should be confined to short\ndistances. Stonewall Jackson said: \"The hardships of forced marches are\noften more painful than the dangers of battle.\" He did not often call\nupon his troops for extraordinary exertions. It was only when he\nintended a surprise, or when a rapid retreat was imperative, that he\nsacrificed everything for speed. [1] ]\n9. If you march fifty _li_ in order to outman\u0153uver the enemy, you will\nlose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will\nreach the goal.\n[Literally, \"the leader of the first division will be _torn away_.\"]\n10. If you march thirty _li_ with the same object, two-thirds of your\narmy will arrive.\n[In the _T'ung Tien_ is added: \"From this we may know the difficulty of\nman\u0153uvering.\"]\n11. We may take it then that an army without its baggage-train is lost;\nwithout provisions it is lost; without bases of supply it is lost.\n[I think Sun Tz\u016d meant \"stores accumulated in d\u00e9p\u00f4ts.\" But Tu Yu says\n\"fodder and the like,\" Chang Yu says \"Goods in general,\" and Wang Hsi\nsays \"fuel, salt, foodstuffs, etc.\"]",

            "text": "23. The Book of Army Management says:\n[It is perhaps significant that none of the earlier commentators give\nus any information about this work. Mei Yao- Ch'en calls it \"an ancient\nmilitary classic,\" and Wang Hsi, \"an old book on war.\" Considering the\nenormous amount of fighting that had gone on for centuries before Sun\nTz\u016d's time between the various kingdoms and principalities of China, it\nis not in itself improbable that a collection of military maxims should\nhave been made and written down at some earlier period.]\nOn the field of battle,\n[Implied, though not actually in the Chinese.]\nthe spoken word does not carry far enough: hence the institution of\ngongs and drums. Nor can ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence\nthe institution of banners and flags.\n24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means whereby the ears and\neyes of the host may be focussed on one particular point.\n[Chang Yu says: \"If sight and hearing converge simultaneously on the\nsame object, the evolutions of as many as a million soldiers will be\nlike those of a single man.\"!]\n25. The host thus forming a single united body, is it impossible either\nfor the brave to advance alone, or for the cowardly to retreat alone.\n[Chuang Yu quotes a saying: \"Equally guilty are those who advance\nagainst orders and those who retreat against orders.\" Tu Mu tells a\nstory in this connection of Wu Ch'i, when he was fighting against the\nCh'in State. Before the battle had begun, one of his soldiers, a man of\nmatchless daring, sallied forth by himself, captured two heads from the\nenemy, and returned to camp. Wu Ch'i had the man instantly executed,\nwhereupon an officer ventured to remonstrate, saying: \"This man was a\ngood soldier, and ought not to have been beheaded.\" Wu Ch'i replied: \"I\nfully believe he was a good soldier, but I had him beheaded because he\nacted without orders.\"]\nThis is the art of handling large masses of men.\n26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-fires and drums,\nand in fighting by day, of flags and banners, as a means of influencing\nthe ears and eyes of your army.\n[Ch'en Hao alludes to Li Kuang-pi's night ride to Ho-yang at the head\nof 500 mounted men; they made such an imposing display with torches,\nthat though the rebel leader Shih Ssu-ming had a large army, he did not\ndare to dispute their passage.]",

A whole army may be robbed of its spirit;\n[\"In war,\" says Chang Yu, \"if a spirit of anger can be made to pervade\nall ranks of an army at one and the same time, its onset will be\nirresistible. Now the spirit of the enemy's soldiers will be keenest\nwhen they have newly arrived on the scene, and it is therefore our cue\nnot to fight at once, but to wait until their ardor and enthusiasm have\nworn off, and then strike. It is in this way that they may be robbed of\ntheir keen spirit.\" Li Ch'uan and others tell an anecdote (to be found\nin the _Tso Chuan_, year 10, \u00a7 1) of Ts'ao Kuei, a protege of Duke\nChuang of Lu. The latter State was attacked by Ch'i, and the duke was\nabout to join battle at Ch'ang-cho, after the first roll of the enemy's\ndrums, when Ts'ao said: \"Not just yet.\" Only after their drums had\nbeaten for the third time, did he give the word for attack. Then they\nfought, and the men of Ch'i were utterly defeated. Questioned\nafterwards by the Duke as to the meaning of his delay, Ts'ao Kuei\nreplied: \"In battle, a courageous spirit is everything. Now the first\nroll of the drum tends to create this spirit, but with the second it is\nalready on the wane, and after the third it is gone altogether. I\nattacked when their spirit was gone and ours was at its height.

            "text": "ng of the Chinese for the title of\nthis chapter, says it refers to the deliberations in the temple\nselected by the general for his temporary use, or as we should say, in\nhis tent. See. \u00a7 26.]\n1. Sun Tz\u016d said: The art of war is of vital importance to the State.\n2. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to\nruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be\nneglected.\n3. The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be\ntaken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine\nthe conditions obtaining in the field.\n4. These are: (1) The Moral Law; (2) Heaven; (3) Earth; (4) The\nCommander; (5) Method and discipline.\n[It appears from what follows that Sun Tz\u016d means by \"Moral Law\" a\nprinciple of harmony, not unlike the Tao of Lao Tz\u016d in its moral\naspect. One might be tempted to render it by \"morale,\" were it not\nconsidered as an attribute of the _ruler_ in \u00a7 13.]\n5, 6. _The Moral Law_ causes the people to be in complete accord with\ntheir ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives,\nundismayed by any danger.\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz\u016d as saying: \"Without constant practice, the\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\"]\n7. _Heaven_ signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.\n[The commentators, I think, make an unnecessary mystery of two words\nhere. Meng Shih refers to \"the hard and the soft, waxing and waning\" of\nHeaven. Wang Hsi, however, may be right in saying that what is meant is\n\"the general economy of Heaven,\" including the five elements, the four\nseasons, wind and clouds, and other phenomena.]\n8. _Earth_ comprises distances, great and small; danger and security;\nopen ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.\n9. _The Commander_ stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity,\nbenevolence, courage and strictness.\n[The five cardinal virtues of the Chinese are (1) humanity or\nbenevolence; (2) uprightness of mind; (3) self-respect, self-control,\nor \"proper feeling;\" (4) wisdom; (5) sincerity or good faith. Here\n\"wisdom\" and \"sincerity\" are put before \"humanity or benevolence,\" and\nthe two military virtues of \"courage\" and \"strictness\" substituted for\n\"uprightness of mind\" and \"self-respect, self-control, or 'proper\nfeeling.'\"]\n10. By _Method and discipline_ are to be understood the marshalling of\nthe army in its proper subdivisions, the gradations of rank among the\nofficers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the\narmy, and the control of military expenditure.\n11. These five heads should be familiar to every general: he who knows\nthem will be victorious; he who knows them not will fail.\n12. Therefore, in your deliberations, when seeking to determine the\nmilitary conditions, let them be made the basis of a comparison, in\nthis wise:\u2014\n13. (1) Which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the Moral law?\n[I.e., \"is in harmony with his subjects.\" Cf. \u00a7 5.]\n(2) Which of the two generals has most ability?\n(3) With whom lie the advantages derived from Heaven and Earth?\n[See \u00a7\u00a7 7, 8]\n(4) On which side is discipline most rigorously enforced?\n[Tu Mu alludes to the remarkable story of Ts'ao Ts'ao (A.D. 155-220),\nwho was such a strict disciplinarian that once, in accordance with his\nown severe regulations against injury to standing crops, he condemned\nhimself to death for having allowed his horse to shy into a field of\ncorn! However, in lieu of losing his head, he was persuaded to satisfy\nhis sense of justice by cutting off his hair. Ts'ao Ts'ao's own comment\non the present passage is characteristically curt: \"when you lay down a\nlaw, see that it is not disobeyed; if it is disobeyed the offender must\nbe put to death.\"]\n(5) Which army is the stronger?\n[Morally as well as physically. As Mei Yao-ch'en puts it, freely\nrendered, \"_esprit de corps_ and 'big battalions.'\"]\n(6) On which side are officers and men more highly trained?\n[Tu Yu quotes Wang Tz\u016d as saying: \"Without constant practice, the\nofficers will be nervous and undecided when mustering for battle;\nwithout constant practice, the general will be wavering and irresolute\nwhen the crisis is at hand.\"]\n(7) In which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and\npunishment?\n[On which side is there the most absolute certainty that merit will be\nproperly rewarded and misdeeds summarily punished?]\n14. By means of these seven considerations I can forecast victory or\ndefeat.\n15. The general that hearkens to my counsel and acts upon it, will\nconquer:\u2014let such a one be retained in command! The general that\nhearkens not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat:\u2014let\nsuch a one be dismissed!\n[The form of this paragraph reminds us that Sun Tz\u016d's treatise was\ncomposed expressly for the benefit of his patron Ho Lu, king of the Wu\nState.]\n16. While heeding the profit of my counsel, avail yourself also of any\nhelpful circumstances over and beyond the ordinary rules.\n17. According as circumstances are favourable, one should modify one's\nplans.\n[Sun Tz\u016d, as a practical soldier, will have none of the \"bookish\ntheoric.\" He cautions us here not to pin our faith to abstract\nprinciples; \"for,\" as Chang Yu puts it, \"while the main laws of\nstrategy can be stated clearly enough for the benefit of all and\nsundry, you must be guided by the actions of the enemy in attempting to\nsecure a favourable position in actual warfare.\" On the eve of the\nbattle of Waterloo, Lord Uxbridge, commanding the cavalry, went to the\nDuke of Wellington in order to learn what his plans and calculations\nwere for the morrow, because, as he explained, he might suddenly find\nhimself Commander-in-chief and would be unable to frame new plans in a\ncritical moment. The Duke listened quietly and then said: \"Who will\nattack the first tomorrow\u2014I or Bonaparte?\" \"Bonaparte,\" replied Lord\nUxbridge. \"Well,\" continued the Duke, \"Bonaparte has not given me any\nidea of his projects; and as my plans will depend upon his, how can you\nexpect me to tell you what mine are?\" [1] ]\n18. All warfare is based on deception.\n[The truth of this pithy and profound saying will be admitted by every\nsoldier. Col. Henderson tells us that Wellington, great in so many\nmilitary qualities, was especially distinguished by \"the extraordinary\nskill with which he concealed his movements and deceived both friend\nand foe.\"]\n19. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our\nforces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy\nbelieve we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are\nnear.\n20. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.\n[All commentators, except Chang Yu, say, \"When he is in disorder, crush\nhim.\" It is more natural to suppose that Sun Tz\u016d is still illustrating\nthe uses of deception in war.]\n21. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in\nsuperior strength, evade him.\n22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him.\nPretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.\n[Wang Tz\u016d, quoted by Tu Yu, says that the good tactician plays with his\nadversary as a cat plays with a mouse, first feigning weakness and\nimmobility, and then suddenly pouncing upon him.]\n23. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest.\n[This is probably the meaning though Mei Yao-ch'en has the note: \"while\nwe are taking our ease, wait for the enemy to tire himself out.\" The\n_Yu Lan_ has \"Lure him on and tire him out.\"]\nIf his forces are united, separate them.\n[Less plausible is the interpretation favoured by most of the\ncommentators: \"If sovereign and subject are in accord, put division\nbetween them.\"]\n24. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not\nexpected.\n25. These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged\nbeforehand.\n26. Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his\ntemple ere the battle is fought.\n[Chang Yu tells us that in ancient times it was customary for a temple\nto be set apart for the use of a general who was about to take the\nfield, in order that he might there elaborate his plan of campaign.]\nThe general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand.\nThus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to\ndefeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this\npoint that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.\n[1] \"Words on Wellington,\" by Sir. W. Fraser.",

After crossing a river, you should get far away from it.\n[\"In order to tempt the enemy to cross after you,\" according to Ts'ao\nKung, and also, says Chang Yu, \"in order not to be impeded in your\nevolutions.\" The _T'ung Tien_ reads, \"If _the enemy_ crosses a river,\"\netc. But in view of the next sentence, this is almost certainly an\ninterpolation.]\n4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward march, do not\nadvance to meet it in mid-stream. It will be best to let half the army\nget across, and then deliver your attack.\n[Li Ch'uan alludes to the great victory won by Han Hsin over Lung Chu\nat the Wei River. Turning to the _Ch'ien Han Shu_, ch. 34, fol. 6\nverso, we find the battle described as follows: \"The two armies were\ndrawn up on opposite sides of the river. In the night, Han Hsin ordered\nhis men to take some ten thousand sacks filled with sand and construct\na dam higher up. Then, leading half his army across, he attacked Lung\nChu; but after a time, pretending to have failed in his attempt, he\nhastily withdrew to the other bank. Lung Chu was much elated by this\nunlooked-for success, and exclaiming: \"I felt sure that Han Hsin was\nreally a coward!\" he pursued him and began crossing the river in his\nturn. Han Hsin now sent a party to cut open the sandbags, thus\nreleasing a great volume of water, which swept down and prevented the\ngreater portion of Lung Chu's army from getting across. He then turned\nupon the force which had been cut off, and annihilated it, Lung Chu\nhimself being amongst the slain. The rest of the army, on the further\nbank, also scattered and fled in all directions.]\n5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet the invader\nnear a river which he has to cross.\n[For fear of preventing his crossing.]\n6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and facing the sun.\n[See _supra_, \u00a7 2. The repetition of these words in connection with\nwater is very awkward. Chang Yu has the note: \"Said either of troops\nmarshalled on the river-bank, or of boats anchored in the stream itself;\nin either case it is essential to be higher than the enemy and facing\nthe sun.\" The other commentators are not at all explicit.]\nDo not move up-stream to meet the enemy.\n[Tu Mu says: \"As water flows downwards, we must not pitch our camp on\nthe lower reaches of a river, for fear the enemy should open the\nsluices and sweep us away in a flood. Chu-ko Wu-hou has remarked that\n'in river warfare we must not advance against the stream,' which is as\nmuch as to say that our fleet must not be anchored below that of the\nenemy, for then they would be able to take advantage of the current and\nmake short work of us.\" There is also the danger, noted by other\ncommentators, that the enemy may throw poison on the water to be\ncarried down to us.]\nSo much for river warfare.",

            "text": "about to advance.\n[\"As though they stood in great fear of us,\" says Tu Mu. \"Their object\nis to make us contemptuous and careless, after which they will attack\nus.\" Chang Yu alludes to the story of T'ien Tan of the Ch'i-mo against\nthe Yen forces, led by Ch'i Chieh. In ch. 82 of the _Shih Chi_ we read:\n\"T'ien Tan openly said: 'My only fear is that the Yen army may cut off\nthe noses of their Ch'i prisoners and place them in the front rank to\nfight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.' The other\nside being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion;\nbut those within the city were enraged at seeing their\nfellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should\nfall into the enemy's hands, were nerved to defend themselves more\nobstinately than ever. Once again T'ien Tan sent back converted spies\nwho reported these words to the enemy: \"What I dread most is that the\nmen of Yen may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by\ninflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become\nfaint-hearted.' Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and\nburned the corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of Chi-mo,\nwitnessing the outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were\nall impatient to go out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold.\nT'ien Tan knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise.\nBut instead of a sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and\nordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the\nranks were filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served\nout all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The\nregular soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were\nmanned with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys\nwere dispatched to the enemy's camp to arrange terms of surrender,\nwhereupon the Yen army began shouting for joy. T'ien Tan also collected\n20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the wealthy citizens\nof Chi-mo to send it to the Yen general with the prayer that, when the\ntown capitulated, he would not allow their homes to be plundered or\ntheir women to be maltreated. Ch'i Chieh, in high good humor, granted\ntheir prayer; but his army now became increasingly slack and careless.\nMeanwhile, T'ien Tan got together a thousand oxen, decked them with\npieces of red silk, painted their bodies, dragon-like, with colored\nstripes, and fastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased\nrushes on their tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the\nrushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had\npierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked\nwarriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the\nenemy's camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for\ntheir tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their\nbodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom\nthey came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had crept up\nwith gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on the enemy. At\nthe same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself, all those\nthat remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums\nand hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed\nby the uproar. Terror-stricken, the Yen army fled in disorder, hotly\npursued by the men of Ch'i, who succeeded in slaying their general Ch'i\nChien\u2026. The result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some\nseventy cities which had belonged to the Ch'i State.\"]\nViolent language and driving forward as if to the attack are signs that\nhe will retreat.\n25. When the light chariots come out first and take up a position on\nthe wings, it is a sign that the enemy is forming for battle.\n26. Peace proposals unaccompanied by a sworn covenant indicate a plot.\n[The reading here is uncertain. Li Ch'uan indicates \"a treaty confirmed\nby oaths and hostages.\" Wang Hsi and Chang Yu, on the other hand,\nsimply say \"without reason,\" \"on a frivolous pretext.\"]\n27. When there is much running about\n[Every man hastening to his proper place under his own regimental\nbanner.]\nand the soldiers fall into rank, it means that the critical moment has\ncome.\n28. When some are seen advancing and some retreating, it is a lure.\n29. When the soldiers stand leaning on their spears, they are faint\nfrom want of food.\n30. If those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves,\nthe army is suffering from thirst.\n[As Tu Mu remarks: \"One may know the condition of a whole army from the\nbehavior of a single man.\"]\n31. If the enemy sees an advantage to be gained and makes no effort to\nsecure it, the soldiers are exhausted.\n32. If birds gather on any spot, it is unoccupied.\n[A useful fact to bear in mind when, for instance, as Ch'en Hao says,\nthe enemy has secretly abandoned his camp.]\nClamour by night betokens nervousness.\n33. If there is disturbance in the camp, the general's authority is\nweak. If the banners and flags are shifted about, sedition is afoot. If\nthe officers are angry, it means that the men are weary.\n[Tu Mu understands the sentence differently: \"If all the officers of an\narmy are angry with their general, it means that they are broken with\nfatigue\" owing to the exertions which he has demanded from them.]\n34. When an army feeds its horses with grain and kills its cattle for\nfood,\n[In the ordinary course of things, the men would be fed on grain and\nthe horses chiefly on grass.]\nand when the men do not hang their cooking-pots over the camp-fires,\nshowing that they will not return to their tents, you may know that\nthey are determined to fight to the death.\n[I may quote here the illustrative passage from the _Hou Han Shu_, ch.\n71, given in abbreviated form by the _P'ei Wen Yun Fu:_ \"The rebel Wang\nKuo of Liang was besieging the town of Ch'en- ts'ang, and Huang-fu\nSung, who was in supreme command, and Tung Cho were sent out against\nhim. The latter pressed for hasty measures, but Sung turned a deaf ear\nto his counsel. At last the rebels were utterly worn out, and began to\nthrow down their weapons of their own accord. Sung was not advancing to\nthe attack, but Cho said: 'It is a principle of war not to pursue\ndesperate men and not to press a retreating host.' Sung answered: 'That\ndoes not apply here. What I am about to attack is a jaded army, not a\nretreating host; with disciplined troops I am falling on a disorganized\nmultitude, not a band of desperate men.' Thereupon he advances to the\nattack unsupported by his colleague, and routed the enemy, Wang Kuo\nbeing slain.\"]\n35. The sight of men whispering together in small knots or speaking in\nsubdued tones points to disaffection amongst the rank and file.\n36. Too frequent rewards signify that the enemy is at the end of his\nresources;\n[Because, when an army is hard pressed, as Tu Mu says, there is always\na fear of mutiny, and lavish rewards are given to keep the men in good\ntemper.]\ntoo many punishments betray a condition of dire distress.\n[Because in such case discipline becomes relaxed, and unwonted severity\nis necessary to keep the men to their duty.]",

            "text": "37. To begin by bluster, but afterwards to take fright at the enemy's\nnumbers, shows a supreme lack of intelligence.\n[I follow the interpretation of Ts'ao Kung, also adopted by Li Ch'uan,\nTu Mu, and Chang Yu. Another possible meaning set forth by Tu Yu, Chia\nLin, Mei Tao-ch'en and Wang Hsi, is: \"The general who is first\ntyrannical towards his men, and then in terror lest they should mutiny,\netc.\" This would connect the sentence with what went before about\nrewards and punishments.]\n38. When envoys are sent with compliments in their mouths, it is a sign\nthat the enemy wishes for a truce.\n[Tu Mu says: \"If the enemy open friendly relations be sending hostages,\nit is a sign that they are anxious for an armistice, either because\ntheir strength is exhausted or for some other reason.\" But it hardly\nneeds a Sun Tz\u016d to draw such an obvious inference.]\n39. If the enemy's troops march up angrily and remain facing ours for a\nlong time without either joining battle or taking themselves off again,\nthe situation is one that demands great vigilance and circumspection.\n[Ts'ao Kung says a man\u0153uver of this sort may be only a ruse to gain\ntime for an unexpected flank attack or the laying of an ambush.]\n40. If our troops are no more in number than the enemy, that is amply\nsufficient; it only means that no direct attack can be made.\n[Literally, \"no martial advance.\" That is to say, _cheng_ tactics and\nfrontal attacks must be eschewed, and stratagem resorted to instead.]\nWhat we can do is simply to concentrate all our available strength,\nkeep a close watch on the enemy, and obtain reinforcements.\n[This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in\nsqueezing very good sense out of it. I follow Li Ch'uan, who appears to\noffer the simplest explanation: \"Only the side that gets more men will\nwin.\" Fortunately we have Chang Yu to expound its meaning to us in\nlanguage which is lucidity itself: \"When the numbers are even, and no\nfavourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough\nto deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst\nour sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and\nkeeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory. But\nwe must avoid borrowing foreign soldiers to help us.\" He then quotes\nfrom Wei Liao Tz\u016d, ch. 3: \"The nominal strength of mercenary troops may\nbe 100,000, but their real value will be not more than half that\nfigure.\"]\n41. He who exercises no forethought but makes light of his opponents is\nsure to be captured by them.\n[Ch'en Hao, quoting from the _Tso Chuan_, says: \"If bees and scorpions\ncarry poison, how much more will a hostile state! Even a puny opponent,\nthen, should not be treated with contempt.\"]\n42. If soldiers are punished before they have grown attached to you,\nthey will not prove submissive; and, unless submissive, then will be\npractically useless. If, when the soldiers have become attached to you,\npunishments are not enforced, they will still be useless.\n43. Therefore soldiers must be treated in the first instance with\nhumanity, but kept under control by means of iron discipline.\n[Yen Tz\u016d [B.C. 493] said of Ssu-ma Jang-chu: \"His civil virtues\nendeared him to the people; his martial prowess kept his enemies in\nawe.\" Cf. Wu Tz\u016d, ch. 4 init.: \"The ideal commander unites culture with\na warlike temper; the profession of arms requires a combination of\nhardness and tenderness.\"]\nThis is a certain road to victory.\n44. If in training soldiers commands are habitually enforced, the army\nwill be well-disciplined; if not, its discipline will be bad.\n45. If a general shows confidence in his men but always insists on his\norders being obeyed,\n[Tu Mu says: \"A general ought in time of peace to show kindly\nconfidence in his men and also make his authority respected, so that\nwhen they come to face the enemy, orders may be executed and discipline\nmaintained, because they all trust and look up to him.\" What Sun Tz\u016d\nhas said in \u00a7 44, however, would lead one rather to expect something\nlike this: \"If a general is always confident that his orders will be\ncarried out,\" etc.\"]\nthe gain will be mutual.\n[Chang Yu says: \"The general has confidence in the men under his\ncommand, and the men are docile, having confidence in him. Thus the\ngain is mutual.\" He quotes a pregnant sentence from Wei Liao Tz\u016d, ch.\n4: \"The art of giving orders is not to try to rectify minor blunders\nand not to be swayed by petty doubts.\" Vacillation and fussiness are\nthe surest means of sapping the confidence of an army.]\n[1] \"Aids to Scouting,\" p. 26.",

Huang Shih-kung of the Ch'in dynasty, who is said\nto have been the patron of Chang Liang and to have written the _San\nLueh_, has these words attributed to him: \"The responsibility of\nsetting an army in motion must devolve on the general alone; if advance\nand retreat are controlled from the Palace, brilliant results will\nhardly be achieved. Hence the god-like ruler and the enlightened\nmonarch are content to play a humble part in furthering their country's\ncause [lit., kneel down to push the chariot wheel].\" This means that\n\"in matters lying outside the zenana, the decision of the military\ncommander must be absolute.\" Chang Yu also quote the saying: \"Decrees\nfrom the Son of Heaven do not penetrate the walls of a camp.\"]\n24. The general who advances without coveting fame and retreats without\nfearing disgrace,\n[It was Wellington, I think, who said that the hardest thing of all for\na soldier is to retreat.]\nwhose only thought is to protect his country and do good service for\nhis sovereign, is the jewel of the kingdom.\n[A noble presentiment, in few words, of the Chinese \"happy warrior.\"\nSuch a man, says Ho Shih, \"even if he had to suffer punishment, would\nnot regret his conduct.\"]\n25. Regard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you\ninto the deepest valleys; look on them as your own beloved sons, and\nthey will stand by you even unto death.\n[Cf. I. \u00a7 6. In this connection, Tu Mu draws for us an engaging picture\nof the famous general Wu Ch'i, from whose treatise on war I have\nfrequently had occasion to quote: \"He wore the same clothes and ate the\nsame food as the meanest of his soldiers, refused to have either a\nhorse to ride or a mat to sleep on, carried his own surplus rations\nwrapped in a parcel, and shared every hardship with his men. One of his\nsoldiers was suffering from an abscess, and Wu Ch'i himself sucked out\nthe virus. The soldier's mother, hearing this, began wailing and\nlamenting. Somebody asked her, saying: 'Why do you cry? Your son is\nonly a common soldier, and yet the commander-in-chief himself has\nsucked the poison from his sore.' The woman replied, 'Many years ago,\nLord Wu performed a similar service for my husband, who never left him\nafterwards, and finally met his death at the hands of the enemy. And\nnow that he has done the same for my son, he too will fall fighting I\nknow not where.'\" Li Ch'uan mentions the Viscount of Ch'u, who invaded\nthe small state of Hsiao during the winter. The Duke of Shen said to\nhim: \"Many of the soldiers are suffering severely from the cold.\" So he\nmade a round of the whole army, comforting and encouraging the men; and\nstraightway they felt as if they were clothed in garments lined with\nfloss silk.]\n26. If, however, you are indulgent, but unable to make your authority\nfelt; kind-hearted, but unable to enforce your commands; and incapable,\nmoreover, of quelling disorder: then your soldiers must be likened to\nspoilt children; they are useless for any practical purpose.\n[Li Ching once said that if you could make your soldiers afraid of you,\nthey would not be afraid of the enemy. Tu Mu recalls an instance of\nstern military discipline which occurred in 219 A.D., when Lu Meng was\noccupying the town of Chiang-ling. He had given stringent orders to his\narmy not to molest the inhabitants nor take anything from them by\nforce. Nevertheless, a certain officer serving under his banner, who\nhappened to be a fellow-townsman, ventured to appropriate a bamboo hat\nbelonging to one of the people, in order to wear it over his regulation\nhelmet as a protection against the rain. Lu Meng considered that the\nfact of his being also a native of Ju-nan should not be allowed to\npalliate a clear breach of discipline, and accordingly he ordered his\nsummary execution, the tears rolling down his face, however, as he did\nso. This act of severity filled the army with wholesome awe, and from\nthat time forth even articles dropped in the highway were not picked\nup.]",

The Wei general Ssu-ma I was then\nmilitary governor of Wan, and getting wind of Meng Ta's treachery, he\nat once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt, having\npreviously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import.\nSsu-ma's officers came to him and said: \"If Meng Ta has leagued himself\nwith Wu and Shu, the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we\nmake a move.\" Ssu-ma I replied: \"Meng Ta is an unprincipled man, and we\nought to go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and\nbefore he has thrown off the mask.\" Then, by a series of forced\nmarches, be brought his army under the walls of Hsin-ch'eng with in a\nspace of eight days. Now Meng Ta had previously said in a letter to\nChu-ko Liang: \"Wan is 1200 _li_ from here. When the news of my revolt\nreaches Ssu-ma I, he will at once inform his imperial master, but it\nwill be a whole month before any steps can be taken, and by that time\nmy city will be well fortified. Besides, Ssu-ma I is sure not to come\nhimself, and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth\ntroubling about.\" The next letter, however, was filled with\nconsternation: \"Though only eight days have passed since I threw off my\nallegiance, an army is already at the city-gates. What miraculous\nrapidity is this!\" A fortnight later, Hsin- ch'eng had fallen and Meng\nTa had lost his head. [See _Chin Shu_, ch. 1, f. 3.] In 621 A.D., Li\nChing was sent from K'uei-chou in Ssu-ch'uan to reduce the successful\nrebel Hsiao Hsien, who had set up as Emperor at the modern Ching-chou\nFu in Hupeh. It was autumn, and the Yangtsze being then in flood, Hsiao\nHsien never dreamt that his adversary would venture to come down\nthrough the gorges, and consequently made no preparations. But Li Ching\nembarked his army without loss of time, and was just about to start\nwhen the other generals implored him to postpone his departure until\nthe river was in a less dangerous state for navigation. Li Ching\nreplied: \"To the soldier, overwhelming speed is of paramount\nimportance, and he must never miss opportunities. Now is the time to\nstrike, before Hsiao Hsien even knows that we have got an army\ntogether. If we seize the present moment when the river is in flood, we\nshall appear before his capital with startling suddenness, like the\nthunder which is heard before you have time to stop your ears against\nit. [See VII. \u00a7 19, note.] This is the great principle in war. Even if\nhe gets to know of our approach, he will have to levy his soldiers in\nsuch a hurry that they will not be fit to oppose us. Thus the full\nfruits of victory will be ours.\" All came about as he predicted, and\nHsiao Hsien was obliged to surrender, nobly stipulating that his people",

The following are the principles to be observed by an invading\nforce: The further you penetrate into a country, the greater will be\nthe solidarity of your troops, and thus the defenders will not prevail\nagainst you.\n21. Make forays in fertile country in order to supply your army with\nfood.\n[Cf. _supra_, \u00a7 13. Li Ch'uan does not venture on a note here.]\n22. Carefully study the well-being of your men,\n[For \"well-being\", Wang Hsi means, \"Pet them, humor them, give them\nplenty of food and drink, and look after them generally.\"]\nand do not overtax them. Concentrate your energy and hoard your\nstrength.\n[Ch'en recalls the line of action adopted in 224 B.C. by the famous\ngeneral Wang Chien, whose military genius largely contributed to the\nsuccess of the First Emperor. He had invaded the Ch'u State, where a\nuniversal levy was made to oppose him. But, being doubtful of the\ntemper of his troops, he declined all invitations to fight and remained\nstrictly on the defensive. In vain did the Ch'u general try to force a\nbattle: day after day Wang Chien kept inside his walls and would not\ncome out, but devoted his whole time and energy to winning the\naffection and confidence of his men. He took care that they should be\nwell fed, sharing his own meals with them, provided facilities for\nbathing, and employed every method of judicious indulgence to weld them\ninto a loyal and homogenous body. After some time had elapsed, he told\noff certain persons to find out how the men were amusing themselves.\nThe answer was, that they were contending with one another in putting\nthe weight and long-jumping. When Wang Chien heard that they were\nengaged in these athletic pursuits, he knew that their spirits had been\nstrung up to the required pitch and that they were now ready for\nfighting. By this time the Ch'u army, after repeating their challenge\nagain and again, had marched away eastwards in disgust. The Ch'in\ngeneral immediately broke up his camp and followed them, and in the\nbattle that ensued they were routed with great slaughter. Shortly\nafterwards, the whole of Ch'u was conquered by Ch'in, and the king\nFu-ch'u led into captivity.]\nKeep your army continually on the move,\n[In order that the enemy may never know exactly where you are. It has\nstruck me, however, that the true reading might be \"link your army\ntogether.\"]\nand devise unfathomable plans.\n23. Throw your soldiers into positions whence there is no escape, and\nthey will prefer death to flight. If they will face death, there is\nnothing they may not achieve.\n[Chang Yu quotes his favourite Wei Liao Tz\u016d (ch. 3): \"If one man were to",

            "text": "[Chu was the personal name of Chuan Chu, a native of the Wu State and\ncontemporary with Sun Tz\u016d himself, who was employed by Kung-tzu Kuang,\nbetter known as Ho Lu Wang, to assassinate his sovereign Wang Liao with\na dagger which he secreted in the belly of a fish served up at a\nbanquet. He succeeded in his attempt, but was immediately hacked to\npieces by the king's bodyguard. This was in 515 B.C. The other hero\nreferred to, Ts'ao Kuei (or Ts'ao Mo), performed the exploit which has\nmade his name famous 166 years earlier, in 681 B.C. Lu had been thrice\ndefeated by Ch'i, and was just about to conclude a treaty surrendering\na large slice of territory, when Ts'ao Kuei suddenly seized Huan Kung,\nthe Duke of Ch'i, as he stood on the altar steps and held a dagger\nagainst his chest. None of the duke's retainers dared to move a muscle,\nand Ts'ao Kuei proceeded to demand full restitution, declaring the Lu\nwas being unjustly treated because she was a smaller and a weaker\nstate. Huan Kung, in peril of his life, was obliged to consent,\nwhereupon Ts'ao Kuei flung away his dagger and quietly resumed his\nplace amid the terrified assemblage without having so much as changed\ncolor. As was to be expected, the Duke wanted afterwards to repudiate\nthe bargain, but his wise old counselor Kuan Chung pointed out to him\nthe impolicy of breaking his word, and the upshot was that this bold\nstroke regained for Lu the whole of what she had lost in three pitched\nbattles.]\n29. The skilful tactician may be likened to the _shuai-jan_. Now the\n_shuai-jan_ is a snake that is found in the Ch'ang mountains.\n[\"_Shuai-jan_\" means \"suddenly\" or \"rapidly,\" and the snake in question\nwas doubtless so called owing to the rapidity of its movements. Through\nthis passage, the term in the Chinese has now come to be used in the\nsense of \"military man\u0153uvers.\"]\nStrike at its head, and you will be attacked by its tail; strike at its\ntail, and you will be attacked by its head; strike at its middle, and\nyou will be attacked by head and tail both.\n30. Asked if an army can be made to imitate the _shuai-jan_,\n[That is, as Mei Yao-ch'en says, \"Is it possible to make the front and\nrear of an army each swiftly responsive to attack on the other, just as\nthough they were part of a single living body?\"]\nI should answer, Yes. For the men of Wu and the men of Y\u00fceh are\nenemies;\n[Cf. VI. \u00a7 21.]\nyet if they are crossing a river in the same boat and are caught by a\nstorm, they will come to each other's assistance just as the left hand\nhelps the right.\n[The meaning is: If two enemies will help each other in a time of\ncommon peril, how much more should two parts of the same army, bound\ntogether as they are by every tie of interest and fellow-feeling. Yet\nit is notorious that many a campaign has been ruined through lack of\ncooperation, especially in the case of allied armies.]\n31. Hence it is not enough to put one's trust in the tethering of\nhorses, and the burying of chariot wheels in the ground.\n[These quaint devices to prevent one's army from running away recall\nthe Athenian hero Sophanes, who carried the anchor with him at the\nbattle of Plataea, by means of which he fastened himself firmly to one\nspot. [See Herodotus, IX. 74.] It is not enough, says Sun Tz\u016d, to\nrender flight impossible by such mechanical means. You will not succeed\nunless your men have tenacity and unity of purpose, and, above all, a\nspirit of sympathetic cooperation. This is the lesson which can be\nlearned from the _shuai-jan_.]",

The principle on which to manage an army is to set up one standard\nof courage which all must reach.\n[Literally, \"level the courage [of all] as though [it were that of]\none.\" If the ideal army is to form a single organic whole, then it\nfollows that the resolution and spirit of its component parts must be\nof the same quality, or at any rate must not fall below a certain\nstandard. Wellington's seemingly ungrateful description of his army at\nWaterloo as \"the worst he had ever commanded\" meant no more than that\nit was deficient in this important particular\u2014unity of spirit and\ncourage. Had he not foreseen the Belgian defections and carefully kept\nthose troops in the background, he would almost certainly have lost the\nday.]\n33. How to make the best of both strong and weak\u2014that is a question\ninvolving the proper use of ground.\n[Mei Yao-ch'en's paraphrase is: \"The way to eliminate the differences\nof strong and weak and to make both serviceable is to utilize\naccidental features of the ground.\" Less reliable troops, if posted in\nstrong positions, will hold out as long as better troops on more\nexposed terrain. The advantage of position neutralizes the inferiority\nin stamina and courage. Col. Henderson says: \"With all respect to the\ntext books, and to the ordinary tactical teaching, I am inclined to\nthink that the study of ground is often overlooked, and that by no\nmeans sufficient importance is attached to the selection of positions\u2026\nand to the immense advantages that are to be derived, whether you are\ndefending or attacking, from the proper utilization of natural\nfeatures.\" [2] ]\n34. Thus the skilful general conducts his army just as though he were\nleading a single man, willy-nilly, by the hand.\n[Tu Mu says: \"The simile has reference to the ease with which he does\nit.\"]\n35. It is the business of a general to be quiet and thus ensure\nsecrecy; upright and just, and thus maintain order.\n36. He must be able to mystify his officers and men by false reports\nand appearances,\n[Literally, \"to deceive their eyes and ears.\"]\nand thus keep them in total ignorance.\n[Ts'ao Kung gives us one of his excellent apophthegms: \"The troops must\nnot be allowed to share your schemes in the beginning; they may only\nrejoice with you over their happy outcome.\" \"To mystify, mislead, and\nsurprise the enemy,\" is one of the first principles in war, as had been\nfrequently pointed out. But how about the other process\u2014the\nmystification of one's own men? Those who may think that Sun Tz\u016d is\nover-emphatic on this point would do well to read Col. Henderson's",

The King of\nKutcha replied by dispatching his chief commander to succour the place\nwith an army drawn from the kingdoms of Wen-su, Ku-mo, and Wei-t'ou,\ntotaling 50,000 men.

The best plan,\nthen, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different\ndirection. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route,\nand I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the\nevening drum has sounded and then start.' Pan Ch'ao now secretly\nreleased the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha\nwas thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set\noff at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar Pan Ch'ao's retreat\nin the west, while the King of Wen-su rode eastward with 8000 horse in\norder to intercept the King of Khotan.

The barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion,\nand were closely pursued by Pan Ch'ao. Over 5000 heads were brought\nback as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and\ncattle and valuables of every description.

From\nthat time forward, Pan Ch'ao's prestige completely overawed the\ncountries of the west.\" In this case, we see that the Chinese general\nnot only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans, but\nactually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive\nthe enemy.]\n37.

            "text": "42. When invading hostile territory, the general principle is, that\npenetrating deeply brings cohesion; penetrating but a short way means\ndispersion.\n[Cf. _supra_, \u00a7 20.]\n43. When you leave your own country behind, and take your army across\nneighbourhood territory, you find yourself on critical ground.\n[This \"ground\" is curiously mentioned in VIII. \u00a7 2, but it does not\nfigure among the Nine Situations or the Six Calamities in chap. X.\nOne's first impulse would be to translate it distant ground,\" but this,\nif we can trust the commentators, is precisely what is not meant here.\nMei Yao-ch'en says it is \"a position not far enough advanced to be\ncalled 'facile,' and not near enough to home to be 'dispersive,' but\nsomething between the two.\" Wang Hsi says: \"It is ground separated from\nhome by an interjacent state, whose territory we have had to cross in\norder to reach it. Hence, it is incumbent on us to settle our business\nthere quickly.\" He adds that this position is of rare occurrence, which\nis the reason why it is not included among the Nine Situations.]\nWhen there are means of communication on all four sides, the ground is\none of intersecting highways.\n44. When you penetrate deeply into a country, it is serious ground.\nWhen you penetrate but a little way, it is facile ground.\n45. When you have the enemy's strongholds on your rear, and narrow\npasses in front, it is hemmed-in ground. When there is no place of\nrefuge at all, it is desperate ground.\n46. Therefore, on dispersive ground, I would inspire my men with unity\nof purpose.\n[This end, according to Tu Mu, is best attained by remaining on the\ndefensive, and avoiding battle. Cf. _supra_, \u00a7 11.]\nOn facile ground, I would see that there is close connection between\nall parts of my army.\n[As Tu Mu says, the object is to guard against two possible\ncontingencies: \"(1) the desertion of our own troops; (2) a sudden\nattack on the part of the enemy.\" Cf. VII. \u00a7 17. Mei Yao-ch'en says:\n\"On the march, the regiments should be in close touch; in an\nencampment, there should be continuity between the fortifications.\"]\n47. On contentious ground, I would hurry up my rear.\n[This is Ts'ao Kung's interpretation. Chang Yu adopts it, saying: \"We\nmust quickly bring up our rear, so that head and tail may both reach\nthe goal.\" That is, they must not be allowed to straggle up a long way\napart. Mei Yao-ch'en offers another equally plausible explanation:\n\"Supposing the enemy has not yet reached the coveted position, and we\nare behind him, we should advance with all speed in order to dispute\nits possession.\" Ch'en Hao, on the other hand, assuming that the enemy\nhas had time to select his own ground, quotes VI. \u00a7 1, where Sun Tz\u016d\nwarns us against coming exhausted to the attack. His own idea of the\nsituation is rather vaguely expressed: \"If there is a favourable\nposition lying in front of you, detach a picked body of troops to\noccupy it, then if the enemy, relying on their numbers, come up to make\na fight for it, you may fall quickly on their rear with your main body,\nand victory will be assured.\" It was thus, he adds, that Chao She beat\nthe army of Ch'in. (See p. 57.)]\n48. On open ground, I would keep a vigilant eye on my defences. On\nground of intersecting highways, I would consolidate my alliances.\n49. On serious ground, I would try to ensure a continuous stream of\nsupplies.\n[The commentators take this as referring to forage and plunder, not, as\none might expect, to an unbroken communication with a home base.]\nOn difficult ground, I would keep pushing on along the road.\n50. On hemmed-in ground, I would block any way of retreat.\n[Meng Shih says: \"To make it seem that I meant to defend the position,\nwhereas my real intention is to burst suddenly through the enemy's\nlines.\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \"in order to make my soldiers fight with\ndesperation.\" Wang Hsi says, \"fearing lest my men be tempted to run\naway.\" Tu Mu points out that this is the converse of VII. \u00a7 36, where\nit is the enemy who is surrounded. In 532 A.D., Kao Huan, afterwards\nEmperor and canonized as Shen-wu, was surrounded by a great army under\nErh-chu Chao and others. His own force was comparatively small,\nconsisting only of 2000 horse and something under 30,000 foot. The\nlines of investment had not been drawn very closely together, gaps\nbeing left at certain points. But Kao Huan, instead of trying to\nescape, actually made a shift to block all the remaining outlets\nhimself by driving into them a number of oxen and donkeys roped\ntogether. As soon as his officers and men saw that there was nothing\nfor it but to conquer or die, their spirits rose to an extraordinary\npitch of exaltation, and they charged with such desperate ferocity that\nthe opposing ranks broke and crumbled under their onslaught.]\nOn desperate ground, I would proclaim to my soldiers the hopelessness\nof saving their lives.\nTu Yu says: \"Burn your baggage and impedimenta, throw away your stores\nand provisions, choke up the wells, destroy your cooking-stoves, and\nmake it plain to your men that they cannot survive, but must fight to\nthe death.\" Mei Yao-ch'en says: \"The only chance of life lies in giving\nup all hope of it.\" This concludes what Sun Tz\u016d has to say about\n\"grounds\" and the \"variations\" corresponding to them. Reviewing the\npassages which bear on this important subject, we cannot fail to be\nstruck by the desultory and unmethodical fashion in which it is\ntreated. Sun Tz\u016d begins abruptly in VIII. \u00a7 2 to enumerate \"variations\"\nbefore touching on \"grounds\" at all, but only mentions five, namely\nnos. 7, 5, 8 and 9 of the subsequent list, and one that is not included\nin it. A few varieties of ground are dealt with in the earlier portion\nof chap. IX, and then chap. X sets forth six new grounds, with six\nvariations of plan to match. None of these is mentioned again, though\nthe first is hardly to be distinguished from ground no. 4 in the next\nchapter. At last, in chap. XI, we come to the Nine Grounds par\nexcellence, immediately followed by the variations. This takes us down\nto \u00a7 14. In \u00a7\u00a7 43-45, fresh definitions are provided for nos. 5, 6, 2,\n8 and 9 (in the order given), as well as for the tenth ground noticed\nin chap. VIII; and finally, the nine variations are enumerated once\nmore from beginning to end, all, with the exception of 5, 6 and 7,\nbeing different from those previously given. Though it is impossible to\naccount for the present state of Sun Tz\u016d's text, a few suggestive facts\nmaybe brought into prominence: (1) Chap. VIII, according to the title,\nshould deal with nine variations, whereas only five appear. (2) It is\nan abnormally short chapter. (3) Chap. XI is entitled The Nine Grounds.\nSeveral of these are defined twice over, besides which there are two\ndistinct lists of the corresponding variations. (4) The length of the\nchapter is disproportionate, being double that of any other except IX.\nI do not propose to draw any inferences from these facts, beyond the\ngeneral conclusion that Sun Tz\u016d's work cannot have come down to us in\nthe shape in which it left his hands: chap. VIII is obviously defective\nand probably out of place, while XI seems to contain matter that has\neither been added by a later hand or ought to appear elsewhere.]\n51. For it is the soldier's disposition to offer an obstinate\nresistance when surrounded, to fight hard when he cannot help himself,\nand to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger.\n[Chang Yu alludes to the conduct of Pan Ch'ao's devoted followers in 73\nA.D. The story runs thus in the _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47: \"When Pan Ch'ao\narrived at Shan-shan, Kuang, the King of the country, received him at\nfirst with great politeness and respect; but shortly afterwards his\nbehavior underwent a sudden change, and he became remiss and negligent.\nPan Ch'ao spoke about this to the officers of his suite: 'Have you\nnoticed,' he said, 'that Kuang's polite intentions are on the wane?\nThis must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians,\nand that consequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with\nwhich side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly\nwise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to\npass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!' Thereupon\nhe called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service, and\nset a trap for him, saying: 'Where are those envoys from the Hsiung-nu\nwho arrived some day ago?' The man was so taken aback that between\nsurprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. Pan Ch'ao,\nkeeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a\ngeneral gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began\ndrinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their heads a\nlittle, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them\nthus: 'Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region,\nanxious to achieve riches and honour by some great exploit. Now it\nhappens that an ambassador from the Hsiung-no arrived in this kingdom\nonly a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy\nextended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this\nenvoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the\nHsiung-no, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert.\nWhat are we to do?' With one accord, the officers replied: 'Standing as\nwe do in peril of our lives, we will follow our commander through life\nand death.' For the sequel of this adventure, see chap. XII. \u00a7 1,\nnote.]\n52. We cannot enter into alliance with neighbouring princes until we are\nacquainted with their designs. We are not fit to lead an army on the\nmarch unless we are familiar with the face of the country\u2014its mountains\nand forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes and swamps. We\nshall be unable to turn natural advantages to account unless we make\nuse of local guides.",

I prefer to\nregard them as interpolated here in order to form an antecedent to the\nfollowing words. With regard to local guides, Sun Tz\u016d might have added\nthat there is always the risk of going wrong, either through their\ntreachery or some misunderstanding such as Livy records (XXII. 13):\nHannibal, we are told, ordered a guide to lead him into the\nneighbourhood of Casinum, where there was an important pass to be\noccupied; but his Carthaginian accent, unsuited to the pronunciation of\nLatin names, caused the guide to understand Casilinum instead of\nCasinum, and turning from his proper route, he took the army in that\ndirection, the mistake not being discovered until they had almost\narrived.]\n53. To be ignorant of any one of the following four or five principles\ndoes not befit a warlike prince.\n54. When a warlike prince attacks a powerful state, his generalship\nshows itself in preventing the concentration of the enemy's forces. He\noverawes his opponents, and their allies are prevented from joining\nagainst him.\n[Mei Tao-ch'en constructs one of the chains of reasoning that are so\nmuch affected by the Chinese: \"In attacking a powerful state, if you\ncan divide her forces, you will have a superiority in strength; if you\nhave a superiority in strength, you will overawe the enemy; if you\noverawe the enemy, the neighbouring states will be frightened; and if\nthe neighbouring states are frightened, the enemy's allies will be\nprevented from joining her.\" The following gives a stronger meaning:\n\"If the great state has once been defeated (before she has had time to\nsummon her allies), then the lesser states will hold aloof and refrain\nfrom massing their forces.\" Ch'en Hao and Chang Yu take the sentence in\nquite another way. The former says: \"Powerful though a prince may be,\nif he attacks a large state, he will be unable to raise enough troops,\nand must rely to some extent on external aid; if he dispenses with\nthis, and with overweening confidence in his own strength, simply tries\nto intimidate the enemy, he will surely be defeated.\" Chang Yu puts his\nview thus: \"If we recklessly attack a large state, our own people will\nbe discontented and hang back. But if (as will then be the case) our\ndisplay of military force is inferior by half to that of the enemy, the\nother chieftains will take fright and refuse to join us.\"]\n55. Hence he does not strive to ally himself with all and sundry, nor\ndoes he foster the power of other states. He carries out his own secret\ndesigns, keeping his antagonists in awe.\n[The train of thought, as said by Li Ch'uan, appears to be this: Secure\nagainst a combination of his enemies, \"he can afford to reject\nentangling alliances and simply pursue his own secret designs, his\nprestige enable him to dispense with external friendships.\"]\nThus he is able to capture their cities and overthrow their kingdoms.\n[This paragraph, though written many years before the Ch'in State\nbecame a serious menace, is not a bad summary of the policy by which\nthe famous Six Chancellors gradually paved the way for her final\ntriumph under Shih Huang Ti. Chang Yu, following up his previous note,\nthinks that Sun Tz\u016d is condemning this attitude of cold-blooded\nselfishness and haughty isolation.]",

Confront your soldiers with the deed itself; never let them know\nyour design.\n[Literally, \"do not tell them words;\" i.e. do not give your reasons for\nany order. Lord Mansfield once told a junior colleague to \"give no\nreasons\" for his decisions, and the maxim is even more applicable to a\ngeneral than to a judge.]\nWhen the outlook is bright, bring it before their eyes; but tell them\nnothing when the situation is gloomy.\n58. Place your army in deadly peril, and it will survive; plunge it\ninto desperate straits, and it will come off in safety.\n[These words of Sun Tz\u016d were once quoted by Han Hsin in explanation of\nthe tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already\nalluded to on p. 28. In 204 B.C., he was sent against the army of Chao,\nand halted ten miles from the mouth of the Ching-hsing pass, where the\nenemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body\nof 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red\nflag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles\nand keep a secret watch on the enemy. \"When the men of Chao see me in\nfull flight,\" Han Hsin said, \"they will abandon their fortifications\nand give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down\nthe Chao standards and set up the red banners of Han in their stead.\"\nTurning then to his other officers, he remarked: \"Our adversary holds a\nstrong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he\nsees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I\nshould turn back and escape through the mountains.\" So saying, he first\nof all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them\nto form in line of battle with their backs to the River Ti. Seeing this\nman\u0153uver, the whole army of Chao broke into loud laughter. By this time\nit was broad daylight, and Han Hsin, displaying the generalissimo's\nflag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately\nengaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time;\nuntil at length Han Hsin and his colleague Chang Ni, leaving drums and\nbanner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where\nanother fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them\nand to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but\nthe two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was\nfighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the\n2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of Chao\nfollowing up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls,\ntore up the enemy's flags and replaced them by those of Han. When the\nChao army looked back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags\nstruck them with terror. Convinced that the Hans had got in and\noverpowered their king, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of\ntheir leader to stay the panic being in vain. Then the Han army fell on\nthem from both sides and completed the rout, killing a number and\ncapturing the rest, amongst whom was King Ya himself\u2026. After the\nbattle, some of Han Hsin's officers came to him and said: \"In the _Art\nof War_ we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a\nriver or marsh on the left front. [This appears to be a blend of Sun\nTz\u016d and T'ai Kung. See IX \u00a7 9, and note.] You, on the contrary, ordered\nus to draw up our troops with the river at our back. Under these\nconditions, how did you manage to gain the victory?\" The general\nreplied: \"I fear you gentlemen have not studied the Art of War with\nsufficient care. Is it not written there: 'Plunge your army into\ndesperate straits and it will come off in safety; place it in deadly\nperil and it will survive'? Had I taken the usual course, I should\nnever have been able to bring my colleague round. What says the\nMilitary Classic\u2014'Swoop down on the market-place and drive the men off\nto fight.' [This passage does not occur in the present text of Sun\nTz\u016d.] If I had not placed my troops in a position where they were\nobliged to fight for their lives, but had allowed each man to follow\nhis own discretion, there would have been a general _d\u00e9bandade_, and it\nwould have been impossible to do anything with them.\" The officers\nadmitted the force of his argument, and said: \"These are higher tactics\nthan we should have been capable of.\" [See _Ch'ien Han Shu_, ch. 34,\nff. 4, 5.] ]\n59. For it is precisely when a force has fallen into harm's way that is\ncapable of striking a blow for victory.\n[Danger has a bracing effect.]\n60. Success in warfare is gained by carefully accommodating ourselves\nto the enemy's purpose.\n[Ts'ao Kung says: \"Feign stupidity\"\u2014by an appearance of yielding and\nfalling in with the enemy's wishes. Chang Yu's note makes the meaning\nclear: \"If the enemy shows an inclination to advance, lure him on to do\nso; if he is anxious to retreat, delay on purpose that he may carry out\nhis intention.\" The object is to make him remiss and contemptuous\nbefore we deliver our attack.]\n61. By persistently hanging on the enemy's flank,\n[I understand the first four words to mean \"accompanying the enemy in\none direction.\" Ts'ao Kung says: \"unite the soldiers and make for the\nenemy.\" But such a violent displacement of characters is quite\nindefensible.]\nwe shall succeed in the long run\n[Literally, \"after a thousand _li_.\"]\nin killing the commander-in-chief.\n[Always a great point with the Chinese.]\n62. This is called ability to accomplish a thing by sheer cunning.\n63. On the day that you take up your command, block the frontier\npasses, destroy the official tallies,\n[These were tablets of bamboo or wood, one half of which was issued as\na permit or passport by the official in charge of a gate. Cf. the\n\"border-warden\" of _Lun Yu_ III. 24, who may have had similar duties.\nWhen this half was returned to him, within a fixed period, he was\nauthorized to open the gate and let the traveler through.]\nand stop the passage of all emissaries.\n[Either to or from the enemy's country.]\n64. Be stern in the council-chamber,\n[Show no weakness, and insist on your plans being ratified by the\nsovereign.]\nso that you may control the situation.\n[Mei Yao-ch'en understands the whole sentence to mean: Take the\nstrictest precautions to ensure secrecy in your deliberations.]\n65. If the enemy leaves a door open, you must rush in.\n66. Forestall your opponent by seizing what he holds dear,\n[Cf. _supra_, \u00a7 18.]\nand subtly contrive to time his arrival on the ground.\n[Ch'en Hao's explanation: \"If I manage to seize a favourable position,\nbut the enemy does not appear on the scene, the advantage thus obtained\ncannot be turned to any practical account. He who intends therefore, to\noccupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an\nartful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him\ninto going there as well.\" Mei Yao-ch'en explains that this \"artful\nappointment\" is to be made through the medium of the enemy's own spies,\nwho will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to\ngive them. Then, having cunningly disclosed our intentions, \"we must\nmanage, though starting after the enemy, to arrive before him (VII. \u00a7\n4). We must start after him in order to ensure his marching thither; we\nmust arrive before him in order to capture the place without trouble.\nTaken thus, the present passage lends some support to Mei Yao-ch'en's\ninterpretation of \u00a7 47.]\n67. Walk in the path defined by rule,\n[Chia Lin says: \"Victory is the only thing that matters, and this\ncannot be achieved by adhering to conventional canons.\" It is\nunfortunate that this variant rests on very slight authority, for the\nsense yielded is certainly much more satisfactory. Napoleon, as we\nknow, according to the veterans of the old school whom he defeated, won\nhis battles by violating every accepted canon of warfare.]\nand accommodate yourself to the enemy until you can fight a decisive\nbattle.\n[Tu Mu says: \"Conform to the enemy's tactics until a favourable\nopportunity offers; then come forth and engage in a battle that shall\nprove decisive.\"]\n68. At first, then, exhibit the coyness of a maiden, until the enemy\ngives you an opening; afterwards emulate the rapidity of a running\nhare, and it will be too late for the enemy to oppose you.\n[As the hare is noted for its extreme timidity, the comparison hardly",

Li Ch'uan says: \"Set fire to the camp, and kill the\nsoldiers\" (when they try to escape from the flames). Pan Ch'ao, sent on\na diplomatic mission to the King of Shan-shan [see XI. \u00a7 51, note],\nfound himself placed in extreme peril by the unexpected arrival of an\nenvoy from the Hsiung-nu [the mortal enemies of the Chinese]. In\nconsultation with his officers, he exclaimed: \"Never venture, never\nwin! [1] The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire\non the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to\ndiscern our numbers. Profiting by their panic, we shall exterminate\nthem completely; this will cool the King's courage and cover us with\nglory, besides ensuring the success of our mission.' The officers all\nreplied that it would be necessary to discuss the matter first with the\nIntendant. Pan Ch'ao then fell into a passion: 'It is today,' he cried,\n'that our fortunes must be decided! The Intendant is only a humdrum\ncivilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and\neverything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy\nfate for valiant warriors.' All then agreed to do as he wished.\nAccordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly\nmade their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the\ntime. Pan Ch'ao ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind\nthe enemy's barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot\nup, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The\nrest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade\nat the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the\nwindward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose\non the front and rear of the Hsiung-nu, who rushed out pell-mell in\nfrantic disorder. Pan Ch'ao slew three of them with his own hand, while\nhis companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite.\nThe remainder, more than a hundred in all, perished in the flames. On\nthe following day, Pan Ch'ao, divining his thoughts, said with uplifted\nhand: 'Although you did not go with us last night, I should not think,\nSir, of taking sole credit for our exploit.' This satisfied Kuo Hsun,\nand Pan Ch'ao, having sent for Kuang, King of Shan-shan, showed him the\nhead of the barbarian envoy. The whole kingdom was seized with fear and\ntrembling, which Pan Ch'ao took steps to allay by issuing a public\nproclamation. Then, taking the king's sons as hostage, he returned to\nmake his report to Tou Ku.\" _Hou Han Shu_, ch. 47, ff. 1, 2.] ]",

He specifies weapons and other implements, bullion and\nclothing. Cf. VII. \u00a7 11.]\nthe fifth is to hurl dropping fire amongst the enemy.\n[Tu Yu says in the _T'ung Tien:_ \"To drop fire into the enemy's camp.\nThe method by which this may be done is to set the tips of arrows\nalight by dipping them into a brazier, and then shoot them from\npowerful crossbows into the enemy's lines.\"]\n2. In order to carry out an attack, we must have means available.\n[T'sao Kung thinks that \"traitors in the enemy's camp\" are referred to.\nBut Ch'en Hao is more likely to be right in saying: \"We must have\nfavourable circumstances in general, not merely traitors to help us.\"\nChia Lin says: \"We must avail ourselves of wind and dry weather.\"]\nthe material for raising fire should always be kept in readiness.\n[Tu Mu suggests as material for making fire: \"dry vegetable matter,\nreeds, brushwood, straw, grease, oil, etc.\" Here we have the material\ncause. Chang Yu says: \"vessels for hoarding fire, stuff for lighting\nfires.\"]\n3. There is a proper season for making attacks with fire, and special\ndays for starting a conflagration.\n4. The proper season is when the weather is very dry; the special days\nare those when the moon is in the constellations of the Sieve, the\nWall, the Wing or the Cross-bar;\n[These are, respectively, the 7th, 14th, 27th, and 28th of the\nTwenty-eight Stellar Mansions, corresponding roughly to Sagittarius,\nPegasus, Crater and Corvus.]\nfor these four are all days of rising wind.\n5. In attacking with fire, one should be prepared to meet five possible\ndevelopments:\n6. (1) When fire breaks out inside the enemy's camp, respond at once\nwith an attack from without.\n7. (2) If there is an outbreak of fire, but the enemy's soldiers remain\nquiet, bide your time and do not attack.\n[The prime object of attacking with fire is to throw the enemy into\nconfusion. If this effect is not produced, it means that the enemy is\nready to receive us. Hence the necessity for caution.]\n8. (3) When the force of the flames has reached its height, follow it\nup with an attack, if that is practicable; if not, stay where you are.\n[Ts'ao Kung says: \"If you see a possible way, advance; but if you find\nthe difficulties too great, retire.\"]\n9. (4) If it is possible to make an assault with fire from without, do\nnot wait for it to break out within, but deliver your attack at a\nfavourable moment.\n[Tu Mu says that the previous paragraphs had reference to the fire\nbreaking out (either accidentally, we may suppose, or by the agency of\nincendiaries) inside the enemy's camp. \"But,\" he continues, \"if the\nenemy is settled in a waste place littered with quantities of grass, or\nif he has pitched his camp in a position which can be burnt out, we\nmust carry our fire against him at any seasonable opportunity, and not\nawait on in hopes of an outbreak occurring within, for fear our\nopponents should themselves burn up the surrounding vegetation, and\nthus render our own attempts fruitless.\" The famous Li Ling once\nbaffled the leader of the Hsiung-nu in this way. The latter, taking\nadvantage of a favourable wind, tried to set fire to the Chinese\ngeneral's camp, but found that every scrap of combustible vegetation in\nthe neighbourhood had already been burnt down. On the other hand,\nPo-ts'ai, a general of the Yellow Turban rebels, was badly defeated in\n184 A.D. through his neglect of this simple precaution. \"At the head of\na large army he was besieging Ch'ang-she, which was held by Huang-fu\nSung. The garrison was very small, and a general feeling of nervousness\npervaded the ranks; so Huang-fu Sung called his officers together and\nsaid: \"In war, there are various indirect methods of attack, and\nnumbers do not count for everything. [The commentator here quotes Sun\nTz\u016d, V. \u00a7\u00a7 5, 6 and 10.] Now the rebels have pitched their camp in the\nmidst of thick grass which will easily burn when the wind blows. If we\nset fire to it at night, they will be thrown into a panic, and we can\nmake a sortie and attack them on all sides at once, thus emulating the\nachievement of T'ien Tan.' [See p. 90.] That same evening, a strong\nbreeze sprang up; so Huang-fu Sung instructed his soldiers to bind\nreeds together into torches and mount guard on the city walls, after\nwhich he sent out a band of daring men, who stealthily made their way\nthrough the lines and started the fire with loud shouts and yells.\nSimultaneously, a glare of light shot up from the city walls, and\nHuang-fu Sung, sounding his drums, led a rapid charge, which threw the\nrebels into confusion and put them to headlong flight.\" [_Hou Han Shu_,\nch. 71.]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n]\n10. (5) When you start a fire, be to windward of it. Do not attack from\nthe leeward.\n[Chang Yu, following Tu Yu, says: \"When you make a fire, the enemy will\nretreat away from it; if you oppose his retreat and attack him then, he\nwill fight desperately, which will not conduce to your success.\" A\nrather more obvious explanation is given by Tu Mu: \"If the wind is in\nthe east, begin burning to the east of the enemy, and follow up the\nattack yourself from that side. If you start the fire on the east side,\nand then attack from the west, you will suffer in the same way as your\nenemy.\"]\n11. A wind that rises in the daytime lasts long, but a night breeze\nsoon falls.\n[Cf. Lao Tz\u016d's saying: \"A violent wind does not last the space of a\nmorning.\" (_Tao Te Ching_, chap. 23.) Mei Yao-ch'en and Wang Hsi say:\n\"A day breeze dies down at nightfall, and a night breeze at daybreak.\nThis is what happens as a general rule.\" The phenomenon observed may be\ncorrect enough, but how this sense is to be obtained is not apparent.]\n12. In every army, the five developments connected with fire must be\nknown, the movements of the stars calculated, and a watch kept for the\nproper days.\n[Tu Mu says: \"We must make calculations as to the paths of the stars,\nand watch for the days on which wind will rise, before making our\nattack with fire.\" Chang Yu seems to interpret the text differently:\n\"We must not only know how to assail our opponents with fire, but also\nbe on our guard against similar attacks from them.\"]\n13. Hence those who use fire as an aid to the attack show intelligence;\nthose who use water as an aid to the attack gain an accession of\nstrength.\n14. By means of water, an enemy may be intercepted, but not robbed of\nall his belongings.\n[Ts'ao Kung's note is: \"We can merely obstruct the enemy's road or\ndivide his army, but not sweep away all his accumulated stores.\" Water\ncan do useful service, but it lacks the terrible destructive power of\nfire. This is the reason, Chang Yu concludes, why the former is\ndismissed in a couple of sentences, whereas the attack by fire is\ndiscussed in detail. Wu Tz\u016d (ch. 4) speaks thus of the two elements:\n\"If an army is encamped on low-lying marshy ground, from which the\nwater cannot run off, and where the rainfall is heavy, it may be\nsubmerged by a flood. If an army is encamped in wild marsh lands\nthickly overgrown with weeds and brambles, and visited by frequent\ngales, it may be exterminated by fire.\"]",

            "text": "15. Unhappy is the fate of one who tries to win his battles and succeed\nin his attacks without cultivating the spirit of enterprise; for the\nresult is waste of time and general stagnation.\n[This is one of the most perplexing passages in Sun Tz\u016d. Ts'ao Kung\nsays: \"Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.\"\nAnd Tu Mu: \"If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the\ndeserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and\ndisaster will ensue.\" For several reasons, however, and in spite of the\nformidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the\ninterpretation suggested by Mei Yao-ch'en alone, whose words I will\nquote: \"Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and\nassaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink\non occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to\nsuch means of attack of fire, water and the like. What they must not\ndo, and what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold to the\nadvantages they have got.\"]\n16. Hence the saying: The enlightened ruler lays his plans well ahead;\nthe good general cultivates his resources.\n[Tu Mu quotes the following from the _San Lueh_, ch. 2: \"The warlike\nprince controls his soldiers by his authority, kits them together by\ngood faith, and by rewards makes them serviceable. If faith decays,\nthere will be disruption; if rewards are deficient, commands will not\nbe respected.\"]\n17. Move not unless you see an advantage; use not your troops unless\nthere is something to be gained; fight not unless the position is\ncritical.\n[Sun Tz\u016d may at times appear to be over-cautious, but he never goes so\nfar in that direction as the remarkable passage in the _Tao Te Ching_,\nch. 69. \"I dare not take the initiative, but prefer to act on the\ndefensive; I dare not advance an inch, but prefer to retreat a foot.\"]\n18. No ruler should put troops into the field merely to gratify his own\nspleen; no general should fight a battle simply out of pique.\n19. If it is to your advantage, make a forward move; if not, stay where\nyou are.\n[This is repeated from XI. \u00a7 17. Here I feel convinced that it is an\ninterpolation, for it is evident that \u00a7 20 ought to follow immediately\non \u00a7 18.]\n20. Anger may in time change to gladness; vexation may be succeeded by\ncontent.\n21. But a kingdom that has once been destroyed can never come again\ninto being;\n[The Wu State was destined to be a melancholy example of this saying.]\nnor can the dead ever be brought back to life.\n22. Hence the enlightened ruler is heedful, and the good general full\nof caution. This is the way to keep a country at peace and an army\nintact.\n[1] \"Unless you enter the tiger's lair, you cannot get hold of the\ntiger's cubs.\"",

After each side had\nexperienced a number of victories and defeats, Li Hsiung had recourse\nto the services of a certain P'o-t'ai, a native of Wu-tu. He began to\nhave him whipped until the blood came, and then sent him off to Lo\nShang, whom he was to delude by offering to cooperate with him from\ninside the city, and to give a fire signal at the right moment for\nmaking a general assault. Lo Shang, confiding in these promises, march\nout all his best troops, and placed Wei Po and others at their head\nwith orders to attack at P'o-t'ai's bidding. Meanwhile, Li Hsiung's\ngeneral, Li Hsiang, had prepared an ambuscade on their line of march;\nand P'o-t'ai, having reared long scaling-ladders against the city\nwalls, now lighted the beacon-fire. Wei Po's men raced up on seeing the\nsignal and began climbing the ladders as fast as they could, while\nothers were drawn up by ropes lowered from above. More than a hundred\nof Lo Shang's soldiers entered the city in this way, every one of whom\nwas forthwith beheaded. Li Hsiung then charged with all his forces,\nboth inside and outside the city, and routed the enemy completely.\"\n[This happened in 303 A.D. I do not know where Ho Shih got the story\nfrom. It is not given in the biography of Li Hsiung or that of his\nfather Li T'e, _Chin Shu_, ch. 120, 121.]\n11. Having _converted spies_, getting hold of the enemy's spies and\nusing them for our own purposes.\n[By means of heavy bribes and liberal promises detaching them from the\nenemy's service, and inducing them to carry back false information as\nwell as to spy in turn on their own countrymen. On the other hand,\nHsiao Shih-hsien says that we pretend not to have detected him, but\ncontrive to let him carry away a false impression of what is going on.\nSeveral of the commentators accept this as an alternative definition;\nbut that it is not what Sun Tz\u016d meant is conclusively proved by his\nsubsequent remarks about treating the converted spy generously (\u00a7 21\nsqq.). Ho Shih notes three occasions on which converted spies were used\nwith conspicuous success: (1) by T'ien Tan in his defence of Chi-mo\n(see _supra_, p. 90); (2) by Chao She on his march to O-yu (see p. 57);\nand by the wily Fan Chu in 260 B.C., when Lien P'o was conducting a\ndefensive campaign against Ch'in. The King of Chao strongly disapproved\nof Lien P'o's cautious and dilatory methods, which had been unable to\navert a series of minor disasters, and therefore lent a ready ear to\nthe reports of his spies, who had secretly gone over to the enemy and\nwere already in Fan Chu's pay. They said: \"The only thing which causes\nCh'in anxiety is lest Chao Kua should be made general. Lien P'o they\nconsider an easy opponent, who is sure to be vanquished in the long\nrun.\" Now this Chao Kua was a son of the famous Chao She. From his\nboyhood, he had been wholly engrossed in the study of war and military\nmatters, until at last he came to believe that there was no commander\nin the whole Empire who could stand against him. His father was much\ndisquieted by this overweening conceit, and the flippancy with which he\nspoke of such a serious thing as war, and solemnly declared that if\never Kua was appointed general, he would bring ruin on the armies of\nChao. This was the man who, in spite of earnest protests from his own\nmother and the veteran statesman Lin Hsiang-ju, was now sent to succeed\nLien P'o. Needless to say, he proved no match for the redoubtable Po\nCh'i and the great military power of Ch'in. He fell into a trap by\nwhich his army was divided into two and his communications cut; and\nafter a desperate resistance lasting 46 days, during which the famished\nsoldiers devoured one another, he was himself killed by an arrow, and\nhis whole force, amounting, it is said, to 400,000 men, ruthlessly put\nto the sword.]",

His\nsuggestion is, that the Hsia and Yin dynasties were upset owing to the\nintimate knowledge of their weaknesses and shortcoming which these\nformer ministers were able to impart to the other side. Mei Yao-ch'en\nappears to resent any such aspersion on these historic names: \"I Yin\nand Lu Ya,\" he says, \"were not rebels against the Government. Hsia\ncould not employ the former, hence Yin employed him. Yin could not\nemploy the latter, hence Hou employed him. Their great achievements\nwere all for the good of the people.\" Ho Shih is also indignant: \"How\nshould two divinely inspired men such as I and Lu have acted as common\nspies? Sun Tz\u016d's mention of them simply means that the proper use of\nthe five classes of spies is a matter which requires men of the highest\nmental caliber like I and Lu, whose wisdom and capacity qualified them\nfor the task. The above words only emphasize this point.\" Ho Shih\nbelieves then that the two heroes are mentioned on account of their\nsupposed skill in the use of spies. But this is very weak.]",
