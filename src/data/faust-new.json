[_alone_]\nStrange how his pate alone hope never leaves,\nWho still to shallow husks of learning cleaves!\nWith greedy hand who digs for hidden treasure,\nAnd, when he finds a grub, rejoiceth above measure!\nDurst such a mortal voice usurp mine ear\nWhen all the spirit-world was floating near?\nYet, for this once, my thanks are free,\nThou meanest of earth's sons, to thee!\nThy presence drew me back from sheer despair,\nAnd shock too keen for mortal nerve to bear;\nAlas! so giant-great the vision came,\nThat I might feel me dwarf, ev'n as I am.\nI, God's own image that already seemed\nTo gaze where Truth's eternal mirror gleamed,\nAnd, clean divested of this cumbering clay,\nBasked in the bliss of heaven's vivific ray;\nI, more than cherub, with fresh pulses glowing,\nWho well nigh seemed through Nature's deep veins flowing\nLike a pure god, creative virtue knowing,\nWhat sharp reproof my hot presumption found!\nOne word of thunder smote me to the ground.\nAlas! 'tis true! not I with thee and thine\nMay dare to cope! the strength indeed was mine\nTo make thee own my call, but not\nTo chain thee to the charm\u00e8d spot.\nWhen that blest rapture thrilled my frame,\nI felt myself so small, so great;\nBut thou didst spurn me back with shame,\nInto this crazy human state.\nWhere find I aid? what follow? what eschew?\nShall I that impulse of my soul obey?\nAlas! alas! but I must feel it true,\nThe pains we suffer and the deeds we do,\nAre clogs alike in the free spirit's way.\nThe godlike essence of our heaven-born powers\nMust yield to strange and still more strange intrusion;\nSoon as the good things of this world are ours,\nWe deem our nobler self a vain illusion,\nAnd heaven-born instincts--very life of life--\nAre strangled in the low terrestrial strife.\nYoung fancy, that once soared with flight sublime,\nOn venturous vans, ev'n to th' Eternal's throne,\nNow schools her down a little space to own,\nWhen in the dark engulfing stream of time,\nOur fair-faced pleasures perish one by one.\nCare nestles deep in every heart,\nAnd, cradling there the secret smart,\nRocks to and fro, and peace and joy are gone.\nWhat though new masks she still may wear,\nWealth, house and hall, with acres rich and rare,\nAs wife or child appear she, water, flame,\nDagger, or poison, she is still the same;\nAnd still we fear the ill which happens never,\nAnd what we lose not are bewailing ever.\nAlas! alas! too deep 'tis felt! too deep!\nWith gods may vie no son of mortal clay;\nMore am I like to worms that crawl and creep,\nAnd dig, and dig through earth their lightless way,\nWhich, while they feed on dust in narrow room,\nFind from the wanderer's foot their death-blow and their tomb.\nIs it not dust that this old wall\nFrom all its musty benches shows me?\nAnd dust the trifling trumperies all\nThat in this world of moths enclose me?\nHere is it that I hope to find\nWherewith to sate my craving mind?\nNeed I spell out page after page,\nTo know that men in every age\nAnd every clime, have spurred in vain\nThe jaded muscle and the tortured brain,\nAnd here and there, with centuries between,\nOne happy man belike hath been?\nThou grinning skull, what wouldst thou say,\nSave that thy brain, in chase of truth, like mine,\nWith patient toil pursued its floundering way\nBy glimmering lights that through dim twilight-shine?\nYe instruments, in sooth, now laugh at me,\nWith wheel, and cog-wheel, ring, and cylinder;\nAt Nature's door I stood; ye should have been the key,\nBut though your ward be good, the bolt ye cannot stir.\nMysterious Nature may not choose\nTo unveil her secrets to the stare of day,\nAnd what from the mind's eye she stores away,\nThou canst not force from her with levers and with screws.\nThou antique gear, why dost thou cumber\nMy chamber with thy useless lumber?\nMy father housed thee on this spot,\nAnd I must keep thee, though I need thee not!\nThou parchment roll that hast been smoked upon\nLong as around this desk the sorry lamp-light shone;\nMuch better had I spent my little gear,\nThan with this little to sit mouldering here;\nWhy should a man possess ancestral treasures,\nBut by possession to enlarge his pleasures?\nThe thing we use not a dead burden lies,\nBut what the moment brings the wise man knows to prize.\nBut what is this? there in the corner; why\nDoes that flask play the magnet to mine eye?\nAnd why within me does this strange light shine,\nAs the soft nightly moon through groves of sombre pine?\nI greet thee, matchless phial; and with devotion\nI take thee down, and in thy mellow potion\nI reverence human wit and human skill.\nFine essence of the opiate dew of sleep,\nDear extract of all subtle powers that kill,\nBe mine the first-fruits of thy strength to reap!\nI look on thee, and soothed is my heart's pain;\nI grasp thee, straight is lulled my racking brain,\nAnd wave by wave my soul's flood ebbs away.\nI see wide ocean's swell invite my wistful eyes,\nAnd at my feet her sparkling mirror lies;\nTo brighter shores invites a brighter day.\nA car of fire comes hovering o'er my head,\nWith gentle wafture; now let me pursue\nNew flight adventurous, through the starry blue,\nAnd be my wing\u00e8d steps unburdened sped\nTo spheres of uncramped energy divine!\nAnd may indeed this life of gods be mine,\nBut now a worm, and cased in mortal clay?\nYes! only let strong will high thought obey,\nTo turn thy back on the blest light of day,\nAnd open burst the portals which by most\nWith fear, that fain would pass them by, are crossed.\nNow is the time by deeds, not words, to prove\nThat earth-born man yields not to gods above.\nBefore that gloomy cavern not to tremble,\nWhere all those spectral shapes of dread assemble,\nWhich Fancy, slave of every childish fear,\nBids, to the torment of herself, appear;\nForward to strive unto that passage dire,\nWhose narrow mouth seems fenced with hell's collected fire;\nWith glad resolve this leap to make, even though\nThat thing we call our soul should into nothing flow!\nNow come thou forth! thou crystal goblet clear,\nFrom out thy worshipful old case,\nWhere thou hast lain unused this many a year.\nIn days of yore right gayly didst thou grace\nThe festive meetings of my grey-beard sires,",

I'm here at leisure\nTo work your worship's will and pleasure.\nFaust.\nSo, so! such kernel cracked from such a shell!\nA travelling scholar! the jest likes me well!\nMephistopheles.\nI greet the learned gentleman!\nI've got a proper sweating 'neath your ban.\nFaust.\nWhat is thy name?\nMephistopheles.\nWhat is my power were better,\nFrom one who so despises the mere letter,\nWho piercing through the coarse material shell,\nWith Being's inmost substance loves to dwell.\nFaust.\nYes, but you gentlemen proclaim\nYour nature mostly in your name;\nDestroyer, God of Flies, the Adversary,[*1]\nSuch names their own interpretation carry.\nBut say, who art thou?\nMephistopheles.\nI am a part of that primordial Might,\nWhich always wills the wrong, and always works the right.\nFaust.\nYou speak in riddles; the interpretation?\nMephistopheles.\nI am the Spirit of Negation:\nAnd justly so; for all that is created\nDeserves to be annihilated.\n'Twere better, thus, that there were no creation.\nThus everything that you call evil,\nDestruction, ruin, death, the devil,\nIs my pure element and sphere.\nFaust.\nThou nam'st thyself a part, yet standest wholly here.\nMephistopheles.\nI speak to thee the truth exact,\nThe plain, unvarnished, naked fact,\nThough man, that microcosm of folly deems\nHimself the compact whole he seems.\nPart of the part I am that erst was all,\nPart of the darkness, from whose primal pall\nWas born the light, the proud rebellious Light,\nWhich now disputeth with its mother Night,\nHer rank and room i' the world by ancient right.\nYet vainly; though it strain and struggle much,\n'Tis bound to body with the closer clutch;\nFrom body it streams, on body paints a hue,\nAnd body bends it from its course direct;\nThus in due season I expect,\nWhen bodies perish, Light will perish too.\nFaust.\nHold! now I know thy worthy duties all!\nUnable to annihilate wholesale,\nThy mischief now thou workest by retail.\nMephistopheles.\nAnd even thus, my progress is but small.\nThis something, the big lumpish world, which stands\nOpposed to nothing, still ties my hands,\nAnd spite of all the ground that I seem winning,\nRemains as firm as in the beginning;\nWith storms and tempests, earthquakes and burnings,\nEarth still enjoys its evenings and mornings,\nAnd the accurs\u00e8d fry of brute and human clay,\nOn them my noblest skill seems worse than thrown away.\nHow many thousands have I not buried!\nYet still a new fresh blood is hurried\nThrough fresh young veins, that I must sheer despair.\nThe earth, the water, and the air,\nThe moist, the dry, the hot, the cold,\nA thousand germs of life unfold;\nAnd had I not of flame made reservation,\nI had no portion left in the creation.\nFaust.\nAnd thus thou seekest to oppose\nThe genial power, from which all life and motion flows,\nAgainst Existence' universal chain,\nClenching thy icy devil's fist in vain!\nTry some more profitable feats,\nStrange son of Chaos, full of cross conceits.\nMephistopheles.\nThe hint is good, and on occasion,\nMay well deserve consideration;\nMeanwhile, with your good leave, I would withdraw.\nFaust.\nMy leave! do I make devil's law?\nThe liberty, methinks, is all your own.\nI see you here to-day with pleasure,\nGo now, and come back at your leisure.\nHere is the door, there is the window, and\nA chimney, if you choose it, is at hand.\nMephistopheles.\nLet me speak plain! there is a small affair,\nThat, without your assistance, bars my way,\nThe goblin-foot upon the threshold there--\nFaust.\nThe pentagram stands in your way![*n6]\nHa! tell me then, thou imp of sin,\nIf this be such a potent spell\nTo bar thy going out, how cam'st thou in?\nWhat could have cheated such a son of hell?\nMephistopheles.\nLook at it well, the drawing is not true;\nOne angle, that towards the door, you see,\nLeft a small opening for me.\nFaust.\nSo so! for once dame Fortune has been kind,\nAnd I have made a prisoner of you!\nChance is not always blind.\nMephistopheles.\nThe cur sprang in before it looked about;\nBut now the thing puts on a serious air;\nThe devil is in the house and can't get out.\nFaust.\nYou have the window, why not jump out there?\nMephistopheles.\nIt is a law which binds all ghosts and sprites;\nWherever they creep in, there too they must creep out;\nI came in at the door, by the door I must go out.\nFaust.\nSo so! then hell too has its laws and rights,\nThus might one profit by the powers of evil,\nAnd make an honest bargain with the devil.\nMephistopheles.\nThe devil, sir, makes no undue exaction,\nAnd pays what he has promised to a fraction;\nBut this affair requires consideration,\nWe'll leave it for some future conversation.\nFor this time, I beseech your grace,\nLet me be gone; I've work to do.\nFaust.\nStay but one minute, I've scarce seen your face.\nSpeak; you should know the newest of the new.\nMephistopheles.\nI'll answer thee at length some other day;\nAt present, I beseech thee, let me loose.\nFaust.\nI laid no trap to snare thee in the way,\nThyself didst thrust thy head into the noose;\nWhoso hath caught the devil, hold him fast!\nSuch lucky chance returns not soon again.\nMephistopheles.\nIf 'tis your pleasure so, I will remain,\nBut on condition that the time be passed\nIn worthy wise, and you consent to see\nSome cunning sleights of spirit-craft from me.\nFaust.\nThy fancy jumps with mine. Thou may'st commence,\nSo that thy dainty tricks but please the sense.\nMephistopheles.\nThou shalt, in this one hour, my friend,\nMore for thy noblest senses gain,\nThan in the year's dull formal train,\nFrom stale beginning to stale end.\nThe songs the gentle Spirits sing thee,\nThe lovely visions that they bring thee,\nAre not an empty juggling show.\nOn thine ear sweet sounds shall fall,\nOdorous breezes round thee blow,\nTaste, and touch, and senses all\nWith delicious tingling glow.\nNo lengthened prelude need we here,\nSing, Spirit-imps that hover near!\nSpirits.\nVanish ye murky\nOld arches away!\nThrough the cloud curtain\nThat blinds heaven's ray\nMild and serenely\nLook forth the queenly\nEye of the day!\nStar now and starlet\nBeam more benign,\nAnd purer suns now\nSoftlier shine.\nIn beauty ethereal,\nA swift-moving throng,\nOf spirits a\u00ebrial,\nAre waving along,\nAnd the soul follows\nOn wings of desire;\nThe fluttering garlands\nThat deck their attire,\nCover the meadows,\nCover the bowers,\nWhere lovers with lovers\nBreathe rapturous hours.\nBower on bower!\nThe shoots of the vine,\nWith the leaves of the fig-tree,\nTheir tendrils entwine!\nClusters of ripe grapes,\nBright-blushing all,\nInto the wine-press\nHeavily fall;\nFrom fountains divine\nBright rivers of wine\nCome foaming and swirling;\nO'er gems of the purest,\nSparkling and purling,\nThey flow and they broaden\nIn bright vista seen,\nTo deep-bosomed lakes\nLightly fringed with the green,\nWhere leafy woods nod\nIn their tremulous sheen.\nOn light-oaring pinions\nThe birds cut the gale,\nThrough the breezy dominions\nAs sunward they sail;\nThey sail on swift wings\nTo the isles of the blest,\nOn the soft swelling waves\nThat are cradled to rest;\nWhere we hear the glad spirits\nIn jubilee sing,\nAs o'er the green meadows\nFleet-bounding they spring:\nWith light airy footing,\nA numberless throng,\nLike meteors shooting\nThe mountains along;\nSome there are flinging\nTheir breasts to the seas,\nOthers are swinging\nIn undulant ease,\nLovingly twining\nLife's tissue divine,\nWhere pure stars are shining\nIn beauty benign!\nMephistopheles.\nHe sleeps! well done, ye airy urchins! I\nRemain your debtor for this lullaby,\nBy which so bravely ye have sung asleep\nThis restless spirit, who, with all his wit,\nIs not yet quite the man with cunning cast,\nTo hook the devil and hold him fast.\nAround him let your shapes fantastic flit,\nAnd in a sea of dreams his senses steep.\nBut now this threshold's charm to disenchant,\nThe tooth of a rat is all I want;\nNor need I make a lengthened conjuration,\nI hear one scraping there in preparation.\nThe lord of the rats and of the mice,\nOf the flies, and frogs, and bugs, and lice,\nCommands you with your teeth's good saw,\nThe threshold of this door to gnaw!\nForth come, and there begin to file,\nWhere he lets fall this drop of oil.\nHa! there he jumps! that angle there,\nWith thy sharp teeth I bid thee tear,\nWhich jutting forward, sad disaster,\nUnwilling prisoner keeps thy master.\nBriskly let the work go on,\nOne bite more and it is done! [_Exit._\nFaust. [_awakening from his trance_]\nOnce more the juggler Pleasure cheats my lip,\nGone the bright spirit-dream, and left no trace,\nThat I spake with the devil face to face,\nAnd that a poodle dog gave me the slip!\nScene VI.\n/Faust's/ _Study as before._\n/Faust.

[_invisible_]\nWoe! woe!\nThou hast destroyed it!\nThe beautiful world,\nWith mightiest hand,\nA demigod\nIn ruin has hurled!\nWe weep,\nAnd bear its wrecked beauty away,\nWhence it may never\nReturn to the day.\nMightiest one\nOf the sons of earth,\nBrightest one,\nBuild it again!\nProudly resurgent with lovelier birth\nIn thine own bosom build it again!\nLife's glad career\nAnew commence\nWith insight clear,\nAnd purg\u00e8d sense,\nThe while new songs around thee play,\nTo launch thee on more hopeful way!\nMephistopheles.\nThese are the tiny\nSpirits that wait on me;\nHark how to pleasure\nAnd action they counsel thee!\nInto the world wide\nWould they allure thee,\nIn solitude dull\nNo more to immure thee,\nNo more to sit moping\nIn mouldy mood,\nWith a film on thy sense,\nAnd a frost in thy blood!\nCease then with thine own peevish whim to play,\nThat like a vulture makes thy life its prey.\nSociety, however low,\nStill gives thee cause to feel and know\nThyself a man, amid thy fellow-men.\nYet my intent is not to pen\nThee up with the common herd! and though\nI cannot boast, or rank, or birth\nOf mighty men, the lords of earth,\nYet do I offer, at thy side,\nThy steps through mazy life to guide;\nAnd, wilt thou join in this adventure,\nI bind myself by strong indenture,\nHere, on the spot, with thee to go.\nCall me companion, comrade brave,\nOr, if it better please thee so,\nI am thy servant, am thy slave!\nFaust.\nAnd in return, say, what the fee\nThy faithful service claims from me?\nMephistopheles.\nOf that you may consider when you list.\nFaust.\nNo, no! the devil is an Egotist,\nAnd seldom gratis sells his labor,\nFor love of God, to serve his neighbor.\nSpeak boldly out, no private clause conceal;\nWith such as you 'tis dangerous to deal.\nMephistopheles.\nI bind myself to be thy servant here,\nAnd wait with sleepless eyes upon thy pleasure,\nIf, when we meet again in _yonder_ sphere,\nThou wilt repay my service in like measure.\nFaust.\nWhat _yonder_ is I little reck to know,\nProvided I be happy here below;\nThe future world will soon enough arise,\nWhen the present in ruin lies.\n'Tis from this earth my stream of pleasure flows,\nThis sun it is that shines upon my woes;\nAnd, were I once from this my home away,\nThen happen freely what happen may.\nNor hope in me it moves, nor fear,\nIf then, as now, we hate and love;\nOr if in yonder world, as here,\nAn under be, and an above.\nMephistopheles.\nWell, in this humor, you bid fair\nWith hope of good result to dare.\nClose with my plan, and you will see\nAnon such pleasant tricks from me,\nAs never eyes of man did bliss\nFrom father Adam's time to this.\nFaust.\nPoor devil, what hast thou to give,\nBy which a human soul may live?\nBy thee or thine was never yet divined\nThe thought that stirs the deep heart of mankind!\nTrue, thou hast food that sateth never,\nAnd yellow gold that, restless ever,\nLike quicksilver between the fingers,\nOnly to escape us, lingers;\nA game where we are sure to lose our labor,\nA maiden that, while hanging on my breast,\nFlings looks of stolen dalliance on my neighbor;\nAnd honor by which gods are blest,\nThat, like a meteor, vanishes in air.\nShow me the fruit that rots _before_ 'tis broken,\nAnd trees that day by day their green repair!\nMephistopheles.\nA word of mighty meaning thou hast spoken,\nYet such commission makes not me despair.\nBelieve me, friend, we only need to try it,\nAnd we too may enjoy our morsel sweet in quiet.\nFaust.\nIf ever on a couch of soft repose\nMy soul shall rock at ease,\nIf thou canst teach with sweet delusive shows\nMyself myself to please,\nIf thou canst trick me with a toy\nTo say sincerely I /enjoy/,\nThen may my latest sand be run!\nA wager on it!\nMephistopheles.\nDone!\nFaust.\nAnd done, and done!\nWhen to the moment I shall say,\nStay, thou art so lovely, stay!\nThen with thy fetters bind me round,\nThen perish I with cheerful glee!\nThen may the knell of death resound,\nThen from thy service art thou free!\nThe clock may stand,\nAnd the falling hand\nMark the time no more for me!\nMephistopheles.\nConsider well: in things like these\nThe devil's memory is not apt to slip.\nFaust.\nThat I know well; may'st keep thy heart at ease,\nNo random word hath wandered o'er my lip.\nSlave I remain, or here, or there,\nThine, or another's, I little care.\nMephistopheles.\nMy duty I'll commence without delay,\nWhen with the graduates you dine to-day.\nOne thing remains!--black upon white\nA line or two, to make the bargain tight.\nFaust.\nA writing, pedant!--hast thou never found\nA man whose word was better than his bond?\nIs't not enough that by my spoken word,\nOf all I am and shall be thou art lord?\nThe world drives on, wild wave engulfing wave,\nAnd shall a line bind me, if I would be a knave?\nYet 'tis a whim deep-graven in the heart,\nAnd from such fancies who would gladly part?\nHappy within whose honest breast concealed\nThere lives a faith, nor time nor chance can shake;\nYet still a parchment, written, stamped, and sealed,\nA spectre is before which all must quake.\nCommit but once thy word to the goose-feather,\nThen must thou yield the sway to wax and leather.\nSay, devil--paper, parchment, stone, or brass?\nWith me this coin or that will pass;\nStyle, or chisel, or pen shall it be?\nThou hast thy choice of all the three.\nMephistopheles.\nWhat need of such a hasty flare\nOf words about so paltry an affair?\nPaper or parchment, any scrap will do,\nThen write in blood your signature thereto.\nFaust.\nIf this be all, there needs but small delay,\nSuch trifles shall not stand long in my way.\nMephistopheles. [_while Faust is signing the paper_]\nBlood is a juice of most peculiar virtue.\nFaust.\nOnly no fear that I shall e'er demur to\nThe bond as signed; my whole heart swears\nEven to the letter that the parchment bears.\nToo high hath soared my blown ambition;\nI now take rank with thy condition;\nThe Mighty Spirit of All hath scorned me,\nAnd Nature from her secrets spurned me:\nMy thread of thought is rent in twain,\nAll science I loathe with its wranglings vain.\nIn the depths of sensual joy, let us tame\nOur glowing passion's restless flame!\nIn magic veil, from unseen hand,\nBe wonders ever at our command!\nPlunge we into the rush of Time!\nInto Action's rolling main!\nThen let pleasure and pain,\nLoss and gain,\nJoy and sorrow, alternate chime!\nLet bright suns shine, or dark clouds lower,\nThe man that works is master of the hour.",

two! three!\nTrue, it should seem that the tissue of thought\nIs like a web by cunning master wrought,\nWhere one stroke moves a thousand threads,\nThe shuttle shoots backwards and forwards between,\nThe slender threads flow together unseen,\nAnd one with the others thousand-fold weds:\nThen steps the philosopher forth to show\nHow of necessity it must be so:\nIf the first be so, the second is so,\nAnd therefore the third and the fourth is so;\nAnd unless the first and the second before be,\nThe third and the fourth can never more be.\nSo schoolmen teach and scholars believe,\nBut none of them yet ever learned to weave.\nHe who strives to know a thing well\nMust first the spirit within expel,\nThen can he count the parts in his hand,\nOnly without the spiritual band.\n_Encheiresis natur\u00e6_, 'tis clept in Chemistry,\nThus laughing at herself, albeit she knows not why.\nStudent.\nI must confess I can't quite comprehend you.\nMephistopheles.\nIn this respect time by and by will mend you,\nWhen you have learned the crude mixed masses\nTo decompose, and rank them in their classes.\nStudent.\nI feel as stupid to all he has said,\nAs a mill-wheel were whirling round in my head.\nMephistopheles.\nAfter logic, first of all,\nTo the study of metaphysics fall!\nThere strive to know what ne'er was made\nTo go into a human head;\nFor what is within and without its command\nA high-sounding word is always at hand.\nBut chiefly, for the first half year,\nLet order in all your studies appear;\nFive lectures a-day, that no time be lost,\nAnd with the clock be at your post!\nCome not, as some, without preparation,\nBut con his paragraphs o'er and o'er,\nTo be able to say, when you hear his oration,\nThat he gives you his book, and nothing more;\nYet not the less take down his words in writing,\nAs if the Holy Spirit were inditing!\nStudent.\nI shall not quickly give you cause\nTo repeat so weighty a clause;\nFor what with black on white is written,\nWe carry it home, a sure possession.\nMephistopheles.\nBut, as I said, you must choose a profession.\nStudent.\nWith Law, I must confess, I never was much smitten.\nMephistopheles.\nI should be loath to force your inclination,\nMyself have some small skill in legislation;\nFor human laws and rights from sire to son,\nLike an hereditary ill, flow on;\nFrom generation dragged to generation,\nAnd creeping slow from place to place.\nReason is changed to nonsense, good to evil,\nArt thou a grandson, woe betide thy case!\nOf Law they prate, most falsely clept the Civil,\nBut for that right, which from our birth we carry,\n'Tis not a word found in their Dictionary.\nStudent.\nYour words have much increased my detestation.\nO happy he, to whom such guide points out the way!\nAnd now, I almost feel an inclination\nTo give Theology the sway.\nMephistopheles.\nI have no wish to lead you astray.\nAs to this science, 'tis so hard to eschew\nThe false way, and to hit upon the true,\nAnd so much hidden poison lurks within,\nThat's scarce distinguished from the medicine.\nMethinks that here 'twere safest done\nThat you should listen but to one,\nAnd _jurare in verba magistri_\nIs the best maxim to assist thee.\nUpon the whole, I counsel thee\nTo stick to words as much as may be,\nFor such will still the surest way be\nInto the temple of certainty.\nStudent.\nYet in a word some sense must surely lurk.\nMephistopheles.\nYes, but one must not go too curiously to work;\nFor, just when our ideas fail us,\nA well-coined word may best avail us.\nWords are best weapons in disputing,\nIn system-building and uprooting,\nTo words most men will swear, though mean they ne'er so little,\nFrom words one cannot filch a single tittle.\nStudent.\nPardon me, if I trespass on your time,\nThough to make wisdom speak seems scarce a crime;\nOn medicine, too, I am concerned\nTo hear some pregnant word from one so learned.\nThree years, God knows, is a short time,\nAnd we have far to go, and high to climb;\nA wise man's fingers pointing to the goal\nWill save full many a groan to many a laboring soul.\nMephistopheles. [_aside_]\nI'm weary of this dry pedantic strain,\n'Tis time to play the genuine devil again.\n[_Aloud._] The spirit of Medicine 'tis not hard to seize:\nThe world, both great and small, you seek to know,\nThat in the end you may let all things go\nAs God shall please.\nIn vain you range around with scientific eyes,\nEach one at length learns only what he can;\nBut he who knows the passing hour to prize,\nThat is the proper man.\nA goodly shape and mien you vaunt,\nAnd confidence, I guess, is not your want,\nTrust but yourself, and, without more ado,\nAll other men will straightway trust you too.\nBut chiefly be intent to get a hold\nO' the women's minds: their endless Oh! and Ah!\nSo thousandfold,\nIn all its change, obeys a single law,\nAnd, if with half a modest air you come,\nYou have them all beneath your thumb.\nA title first must purchase their reliance,\nThat you have skill surpassing vulgar science;\nThus have you hold at once of all the seven ends,\nRound which another year of labor spends.\nStudy to press the pulse right tenderly,\nAnd, with a sly and fiery eye,\nTo hold her freely round the slender waist,\nThat you may see how tightly she is laced.\nStudent.\nThis seems to promise better; here we see\nWhere to apply and how to use the knife.\nMephistopheles.\nGray, my good friend, is every theory,\nBut green the golden tree of life.\nStudent.\nI vow I feel as in a dream; my brain\nContains much more than it can comprehend;\nSome other day may I come back again,\nTo hear your wisdom to the end?\nMephistopheles.\nWhat I can teach all men are free to know.\nStudent.\nOne little favor grant me ere I go;\nIt were my boast to take home on this page\n[_Presenting a leaf from his album._]\nSome sapient maxim from a man so sage.\nMephistopheles.\nRight willingly.\n[_He writes, and gives back the book._\nStudent. [_reads_]\n_Eritis sicut Deus scientes bonum et malum._\n[_He closes the book reverently, and takes his leave._\nMephistopheles.\nFollow the ancient saw, and my cousin, the famous old Serpent,\nRight soon shalt thou have cause, at thy godlike knowledge to\ntremble!\n_Enter_ /Faust/.",

[_sings again_]\nThere was a king in old times\nThat had a huge big flea,\nAs if it were his own son,\nHe loved it mightily.\nHe sent out for the tailor,\nTo get it a suit of clothes;\nHe made my lord a dress-coat,\nHe made him a pair of hose.\nBrander.\nBe sure that Monsieur le Tailleur be told\nTo take his measure most exact and nice,\nAnd as upon his head he puts a price,\nTo make the hose without or crease or fold!\nMephistopheles.\nIn velvet and in silk clad\nHe strutted proudly then,\nAnd showed his star and garter\nWith titled gentlemen.\nPrime minister they made him,\nWith cross and ribbon gay,\nAnd then all his relations\nAt court had much to say.\nThis caused no small vexation\nAt court; I tell you true--\nThe queen and all her ladies\nWere bitten black and blue.\nAnd yet they durst not catch them,\nNor crack them, when they might,\nBut we are free to catch them,\nAnd crack them when they bite.\nChorus. [_shouting_]\nBut we are free to catch them\nAnd crack them when they bite!\nFrosch.\nBravo, bravo!--his voice is quite divine.\nSiebel.\nSuch fate may every flea befall!\nBrander.\nPoint your nails and crack 'em all!\nAltmayer.\nA glass to liberty!--long live the vine!\nMephistopheles.\nI'd drink to liberty with right good will,\nIf we had only better wine to drink.\nSiebel.\nYou might have kept that to yourself, I think!\nMephistopheles.\nI only fear our host might take it ill,\nElse should I give to every honored guest\nFrom our own cellar of the very best.\nSiebel.\nO never fear!--If you but find the wine,\nOur host shall be content--the risk be mine!\nFrosch.\nGive me a flowing glass, and praise you shall not want,\nSo that your sample, mark me! be not scant;\nI cannot judge of wine, unless I fill\nMy mouth and throat too with a goodly swill.\nAltmayer. [_softly_]\nI see the gentlemen are from the Rhine.\nMephistopheles.\nGive me a gimlet here!--I'll show you wine.\nBrander.\nWhat would the fellow bore?\nHas he then wine-casks at the door?\nAltmayer.\nThere, in the basket, you will find a store\nOf tools, which our good landlord sometimes uses.\nMephistopheles. [_Taking the gimlet._]\n[_To_ /Frosch/.] Now every man may taste of what he chooses.\nFrosch.\nHow mean you that? Can you afford?\nMephistopheles.\nNo fear of that; my cellar is well stored.\nAltmayer. [_to_ /Frosch/]\nAha! I see you smack your lips already.\nFrosch.\nI'll have Rhine wine; what fatherland produces\nIs better far than French or Spanish juices.\nMephistopheles. [_boring a hole in the edge of the table where\n/Frosch/ is sitting_]\nFetch me some wax, to make the stoppers ready.\nAltmayer.\nHe means to put us off with jugglery.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Brander/]\nAnd you, sir, what?\nBrander.\nChampagne for me!\nAnd brisk and foaming let it be!\n[/Mephistopheles/ _bores; meanwhile one of the party has got\nthe stoppers ready, and closes the holes._\nBrander.\nTo foreign climes a man must sometimes roam,\nIn quest of things he cannot find at home;\nFor Frenchmen Germans have no strong affection,\nBut to their wines we seldom make objection.\nSiebel. [_while_ /Mephistopheles/ _is coming round to him_]\nI have no taste for your sour wines to-day,\nI wish to have a swig of good Tokay.\nMephistopheles. [_boring_]\nThat you shall have, and of the very best.\nAltmayer.\nNo, gentlemen!--'tis plain you mean to jest;\nIf so, in me you much mistake your man.\nMephistopheles.\nHa! ha!--no little risk, methinks, I ran,\nTo venture tricks with noble guests like you.\nCome! make your choice, speak boldly out, and I\nWill do my best your wish to gratify.\nAltmayer.\nGive me what wine you please!--only not much ado.\n[_After having bored and stopped up all the holes._\nMephistopheles. [_with strange gestures_]\nGrapes on the vine grow!\nHorns on the goat!\nThe wine is juicy, the vine is of wood,\nThe wooden table can give it as good.\nLook into Nature's depths with me!\nWhoso hath faith shall wonders see!\nNow draw the corks, and quaff the wine!\nAll. [_drawing the corks, and quaffing the out-streaming liquor each\nas he had desired_]\nO blessed stream!--O fount divine!\nMephistopheles.\nDrink on! only be cautious in your hurry.\n[_They drink freely._\nAll. [_singing_]\nNo king of cannibals to day\nMore bravely rules the drinking bout,\nThan we, when, like five hundred swine,\nWe drain the brimming bumpers out!\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nLook at the fellows now!--are they not merry?\nFaust.\nI feel inclined to go!--'tis getting late.\nMephistopheles.\nSoon shall we have a glorious revelation\nOf the pure beast in man, if you but wait.\nSiebel. [_drinks carelessly; the wine falls to the ground and becomes\nflame_]\nHelp! fire! the devil's here! death and damnation!\nMephistopheles. [_Addressing himself to the flames_]\nPeace, friendly element! be still!\n[_To the company._] This time 'twas but a spurt of purgatorial flame.\nSiebel.\nWhat's that?--you little know your men; we'll tame\nYour impudence, you juggling knave, we will!\nFrosch.\n'Twere dangerous to repeat such gambols here!\nAltmayer.\nMethinks 'twere best to whisper in his ear\nThat he had better leave the room.\nSiebel.\nWhat, sirrah? do you then presume\nTo play your hocus-pocus here?\nMephistopheles.\nPeace, old wine-cask!\nSiebel.\nYou broomstick, you!\nMust we then bear your insolence too?\nBrander.\nWait! wait! it shall rain blows anon!\nAltmayer. [_draws a stopper from the table, and fire rushes\nout on him_]\nI burn! I burn!\nSiebel.\nThere's witchcraft in his face!\nThe fellow's an outlaw! strike him down!\n[_They draw their knives and attack_ /Mephistopheles/.\nMephistopheles. [_with serious mien_]\nFalse be eye, and false be ear!\nChange the sense, and change the place!\nNow be there, and now be here!\n[_They look as thunderstruck, and stare at one another._\nAltmayer.\nWhere am I? in what lovely land?\nFrosch.\nVineyards! can it be so?\nSiebel.\nAnd grapes too quite at hand!\nBrander.\nAnd here beneath this shady tree,\nThis noble vine, these blushing clusters see!\n[_He seizes_ /Siebel/ _by the nose. The rest seize one another in the\nsame manner, and lift up their knives._\nMephistopheles. [_as above_]\nLet Error now their eyes unclose,\nThe devil's joke to understand!\n[_He vanishes with_ /Faust/. _The fellows start back from one another._\nSiebel.",

[_pointing to the Brutes_]\nAnd even my good brain is whirling round and round.\nThe Brutes.\nAnd if we well speed,\nAs speed well we ought,\nWe are makers indeed,\nWe are moulders of thought.\nFaust. [_as above_]\nI burn, I burn! this rapturous glow\nConsumes me sheer!--come, let us go!\nMephistopheles. [_as above_]\nOne must, at least, confess that they\nAre honest poets in their way.\n[_The kettle, which had been neglected by the Mother_ /Cat-Ape/\n_begins to boil over: A great flame arises, and runs up the chimney.\nThe Witch comes through the flame, down the chimney, with a terrible\nnoise._\nThe Witch.\nOw! ow! ow! ow!\nThou damn\u00e8d brute! thou curs\u00e8d sow!\nTo leave the kettle and singe the frow!\nThou cursed imp, thou!\n[_Turning to_ /Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.]\nWhat's this here now?\nWho are you? who are you?\nWhat's here ado?\nYe are scouts! ye are scouts!\nOut with the louts!\nA fiery arrow\nConsume your marrow!\n[_She plunges the ladle into the kettle, and spurts out flame on_\n/Faust, Mephistopheles/, _and the Brutes.

In this wise generation\nThe Northern phantom is no longer seen,\nAnd horns and tail and claws have been.\nAnd for my hoof, with which I can't dispense,\nIn good society 'twould give great offence;\nTherefore, like many a smart sprig of nobility,\nI use false calves to trick out my gentility.\nThe Witch. [_dancing_]\nHeyday! it almost turns my brain\nTo see Squire Satan here again!\nMephistopheles.\nWoman, you must not call me by that name!\nThe Witch.\nAnd wherefore not? I see no cause for shame.\nMephistopheles.\nThat name has had its station long assigned\nWith Mother Bunch; and yet I cannot see\nMen are much better for the want of me.\nThe wicked one is gone, the wicked stay behind.\nCall me now Baron, less than that were rude--\nI am a cavalier like other cavaliers;\nMy line is noble, and my blood is good;\nHere is a coat of arms that all the world reveres.\n[_He makes an indecent gesture._\nThe Witch. [_laughing immoderately_]\nHa! ha! now I perceive Old Nick is here!\nYou are a rogue still, as you always were.\nMephistopheles. [_aside to_ /Faust/]\nMy friend, I give you here, your wit to whet,\nA little lesson in witch-etiquette.\nThe Witch.\nNow say, good sirs, what would you have with me?\nMephistopheles.\nA glass of your restoring liquor,\nThat makes an old man's blood run quicker:\nAnd bring the best out from your bins;\nWith years the juice in virtue wins.\nThe Witch.\nMost willingly. Here I have got a phial\nOf which myself at times make trial:\n'Tis now a pleasant mellow potion;\nYou shall not meet with a denial.\n[_Softly._] Yet if this worthy man drinks it without precaution,\nHis life can't stand an hour against its strong infection.\nMephistopheles.\nLeave that to me; he's under my protection,\nRipe for the draught; no harm will come to him.\n[_The_ /Witch/, _with strange gestures, draws a circle and places\nmany curious things within it; meanwhile the glasses begin to tinkle,\nand the kettle to sound and make music. She brings a large book, puts\nthe_ /Cat-Apes/ _into the circle, and makes them serve as a desk to\nlay the book on, and hold the torches. She motions to_ /Faust/ _to\ncome near._\nFaust. [_to_ /Mephistopheles/]\nNow say, what would she with this flummery?\nThese antic gestures, this wild bedlam-stuff,\nThis most insipid of all mummery,\nI know it well, I hate it well enough.\nMephistopheles.\nPshaw, nonsense! come, give up your sermonizing,\nAnd learn to understand what a good joke is!\nLike other quacks, she plays her hocus-pocus;\nIt gives the juice a virtue most surprising!\n[_He obliges_ /Faust/ _to enter the circle._\nThe Witch. [_declaiming from the book with great emphasis_]\nNow be exact!\nOf one make ten,\nThen two subtract,\nAnd add three then,\nThis makes thee rich.\nFour shalt thou bate,\nOf five and six,\nSo says the Witch,\nMake seven and eight,\nAnd all is done.\nAnd nine is one,\nAnd ten is none;\nHere take and spell, if you are able,\nThe Witches' multiplication table.\nFaust.\nThis is a jargon worse than Babel;\nSay, is she fevered? is she mad?\nMephistopheles.\nO never fear! the rest is quite as bad;\nI know the book, and oft have vexed my brains\nWith bootless labor on its rhymes and rules;\nA downright contradiction still remains,\nMysterious alike for wise men and for fools.\nMy friend, the art is old and new;\nAncient and modern schools agree\nWith three and one, and one and three\nPlain to perplex, and false inweave with true.\nSo they expound, discourse, dispute, debate;\nWhat man of sense would plague him with their prate?\nMen pin their faith to words, in sounds high sapience weening,\nThough words were surely made to have a meaning.\nThe Witch.

[_alone_]\nIn honest truth, it was not nobly done,\nIn my good spouse to leave me here alone!\nMay God forgive him! while he roams at large,\nO'er the wide world, I live at my own charge.\nSure he could have no reason to complain!\nSo good a wife he'll not find soon again. [_She weeps._]\nHe may be dead!--Ah me!--could I but know,\nBy a certificate, that 'tis really so!\n_Enter_ /Margaret/.\nMargaret.\nMartha!\nMartha.\nWhat wouldst thou, dear?\nMargaret.\nMy knees can scarcely bear me!--only hear!\nI found a second box to-day\nOf ebon-wood, just where the first one lay,\nBrimful of jewels passing rare,\nMuch finer than the others.\nMartha.\nHave a care\nYou keep this well masked from your mother--\n'Twould fare no better than the other.\nMargaret.\nOnly come near, and see! look here!\nMartha. [_decking her with the jewels_]\nThou art a lucky little dear!\nMargaret.\nAnd yet I dare not thus be seen\nIn church, or on the public green.\nMartha.\nJust come across when you've an hour to spare,\nAnd put the gauds on here with none to see!\nThen promenade awhile before the mirror there;\n'Twill be a joy alike to thee and me.\nThen on a Sunday, or a holiday,\nOur riches by degrees we can display.\nA necklace first, the drops then in your ear;\nYour mother sees it not; and should she hear,\n'Tis easy to invent some fair pretence or other.\nMargaret.\nBut whence the pretty caskets came? I fear\nThere's something in it not right altogether. [_Knocking._]\nGood God!--I hear a step--is it my mother?\nMartha. [_looking through the casement_]\n'Tis a strange gentleman. Come in!\n_Enter_ /Mephistopheles/.\nMephistopheles.\nI hope the ladies will not think me rude,\nThat uninvited thus I here intrude.\n[_Observing_ /Margaret/, _he draws back respectfully._]\nI have commands for Mistress Martha Schwerdtlein.\nMartha.\nFor me? what has the gentleman to say?\nMephistopheles. [_softly to her_]\nExcuse my freedom. I perceive that you\nHave visitors of rank to-day;\nFor this time I shall bid adieu,\nAnd after dinner do myself the pleasure\nTo wait upon you, when you're more at leisure.\nMartha. [_aloud_]\nThink, child! of all things in the world the last!\nMy Gretchen for a lady should have passed!\nMargaret.\nThe gentleman is far too good;\nI'm a poor girl--boast neither wealth nor blood.\nThis dress, these jewels, are not mine.\nMephistopheles.\n'Tis not the dress alone that I admire;\nShe has a mien, a gait, a look so fine,\nThat speak the lady more than costliest attire.\nMartha.\nAnd now your business, sir? I much desire--\nMephistopheles.\nWould God I had a better tale to tell!\nSmall thanks I should receive, I knew it well.\nYour husband's dead--his last fond words I bear.\nMartha.\nIs dead! the good fond soul! O woe!\nMy man is dead! flow, sorrow, flow!\nMargaret.\nBeseech thee, dearest Martha, don't despair.\nMephistopheles.\nNow hear my mournful story to the end.\nMargaret.\nI would not love a man on earth, to rend\nMe thus with grief, when he might hap to die.\nMephistopheles.\nJoy hath its sorrow, sorrow hath its joy;\nTwin sisters are they, as the proverb saith.\nMartha.\nNow let me hear the manner of his death.\nMephistopheles.\nWhere Padua's sacred turrets rise,\nAbove the grave of holy Antony,\nOn consecrated ground thy husband lies,\nAnd slumbers for eternity.\nMartha.\nNo further message? is this all?\nMephistopheles.\nYes! one request, and that not small.\nFor his soul's peace, your good man wanted\nThree hundred masses to be chanted.\nThis is the whole of my commission.\nMartha.\nWhat! not a jewel? not a coin?\nNo journeyman, however poor,\nHowever wild, could make such an omission,\nBut in the bottom of his pouch is sure\nTo keep some small memorial for his wife,\nAnd rather beg, and rather pine\nAway the remnant of his life--\nMephistopheles.\nMadam! for your hard case I greatly grieve,\nBut your good husband had no gold to leave.\nHis sins and follies he lamented sore--\nYes! and bewailed his own mishap much more.\nMargaret.\nAlas for all the miseries of mankind!\nHe shall not want my oft-repeated prayer.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Margaret/]\nThou, gentle heart, dost well deserve to find\nA husband worthy of a bride so fair.\nMargaret.\nAh no!--for that, it is too soon.\nMephistopheles.\nA lover, then, might in the meantime do.\n'Tis bounteous Heaven's choicest boon\nTo fondle in one's arms so sweet a thing as you.\nMargaret.\nSuch things are never done with us.\nMephistopheles.\nDone or not done!--it may be managed thus:--\nMartha.\nNow let me hear!\nMephistopheles.\nBy his death-bed I stood.\nIt was a little better than of dung,\nOf mouldy straw; there, as a Christian should,\nWith many a sin repented on his tongue,\nHe died.--\"Oh! how must I,\" he said,\n\"Myself detest so to throw up my trade,\nAnd my dear wife abandon so!\nIt kills me with the simple memory, oh!\nMight she but now forgive me, ere I die!\"\nMartha. [_weeping_]\nGood soul! I have forgiven him long ago.\nMephistopheles. [_continuing his interrupted narrative_]\nAnd yet was she, God knows, much more to blame than I.\nMartha.\nWhat! did he lie? on the grave's brink to lie!\nMephistopheles.\nHe fabled to the last, be sure,\nIf I am half a connoisseur.\n\"In sooth, I had no time to gape,\" he said,\n\"First to get children, then to get them bread,\nTo clothe them, and to put them to a trade,\nFrom toil and labor I had no release,\nAnd could not even eat my own thin slice in peace.\"\nMartha.\nCan it then be? has he forgotten quite\nMy fag and drudgery, by day and night?\nMephistopheles.\nNot quite! attend the sequel of my tale.\n\"When last we sailed from Malta\"--so he said,\n\"For wife and children fervently I prayed,\nAnd Heaven then blew a favorable gale.\nWe came across a Turkish ship that bore\nHome bullion to increase the Sultan's store,\nAnd soon, by valor's right, were masters\nOf all the Infidel piastres;\nThe precious spoil was shared among the crew,\nAnd I received the part that was my due.\"\nMartha.\nBut where and how?--has he then buried it?\nMephistopheles.\nWho knows where the four winds have hurried it!\nA lady took him under her protection\nAt Naples, as he wandered to and fro;\nShe left him many a mark of her affection,\nAs to his life's end he had cause to know.\nMartha.\nThe knave, to treat his helpless orphans so!\nTo all our misery and all our need,\nAmid his reckless life, he gave no heed!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd for that cause he's dead. If I were you,\nNow mark me well, I tell you what I'd do;\nI'd mourn him decently for one chaste year,\nThen look about me for another dear.\nMartha.\nAlas! God knows it would be hard to find\nAnother so completely to my mind.\nA better-hearted fool you never knew,\nA love of roving was his only vice;\nAnd foreign wine, and foreign women too,\nAnd the accurs\u00e8d gambling dice.\nMephistopheles.\nSuch marriage-articles were most convenient,\nHad he to you been only half so lenient.\nOn terms like these myself had no objection\nTo change with you the ring of conjugal affection.\nMartha.\nYou jest, mein Herr!\nMephistopheles. [_aside_]\nA serious jest for me!\nI'd better go; for, if I tarry here,\nShe'll take the devil at his word, I fear.\n[_To_ /Margaret/.] How stands it with your heart then?--is it free?\nMargaret.\nI scarce know what you mean.\nMephistopheles.\nSweet guileless heart!\nLadies, farewell!\nMargaret.\nFarewell!\nMartha.\nOne word before we part!\nI fain would have it solemnly averred,\nHow my dear husband died, and where he was interred.\nOrder was aye my special virtue; and\n'Tis right both where and when he died should stand\nIn the newspapers.\nMephistopheles.\nYes, when two attest,\nAs Scripture saith, the truth is manifest.\nI have a friend, who, at your requisition,\nBefore the judge will make a deposition.\nI'll bring him here.\nMartha.\nYes, bring him with you, do!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd we shall meet your fair young lady too?\n[_To_ /Margaret/.] A gallant youth!--has been abroad, and seen\nThe world--a perfect cavalier, I trow.\nMargaret.\n'Twould make me blush, should he bestow\nA single look on one so mean.\nMephistopheles.\nYou have no cause to be ashamed before\nThe proudest king that ever sceptre bore.\nMartha.\nThis evening, in the garden then, behind\nThe house, you'll find warm hearts and welcome kind!\nScene VIII.",

but full many an hour\nHeavy with sorrow, and with labor sour.\nThe infant's cradle stood beside\nMy bed, and when it stirred or cried,\nI must awake;\nSometimes to give it drink, sometimes to take\nIt with me to my bed, and fondle it:\nAnd when all this its fretting might not stay,\nI rose, and danced about, and dandled it;\nAnd after that I must away\nTo wash the clothes by break of day.\nI make the markets too, and keep house for my mother,\nOne weary day just like another;\nThus drudging on, the day might lack delights,\nBut food went lightly down, and sleep was sweet o' nights.\n[_They pass on._\nMartha.\nA woman's case is not much to be vaunted;\nA hardened bachelor is hard to mend.\nMephistopheles.\nA few apostles such as you were wanted,\nFrom evil ways their vagrant steps to bend.\nMartha.\nSpeak plainly, sir, have you found nothing yet?\nAre you quite disentangled from the net?\nMephistopheles.\nA house and hearth, we have been often told,\nWith a good wife, is worth its weight in gold.\nMartha.\nI mean, sir, have you never felt the want?\nMephistopheles.\nA good reception I have always found.\nMartha.\nI mean to say, did your heart never pant?\nMephistopheles.\nFor ladies my respect is too profound\nTo jest on such a serious theme as this.\nMartha.\nMy meaning still you strangely miss!\nMephistopheles.\nAlas, that I should be so blind!\nOne thing I plainly see, that you are very kind!\n[_They pass on._\nFaust.\nYou knew me, then, you little angel!

Not in vain hast thou\nTurned toward me thy countenance in fire.\nThou gavest me wide Nature for my kingdom,\nAnd power to feel it, to enjoy it. Not\nCold gaze of wonder gav'st thou me alone,\nBut even into her bosom's depth to look,\nAs it might be the bosom of a friend.\nThe grand array of living things thou mad'st\nTo pass before me, mad'st me know my brothers\nIn silent bush, in water, and in air.\nAnd when the straining storm loud roars, and raves\nThrough the dark forest, and the giant pine,\nRoot-wrenched, tears all the neighboring branches down\nAnd neighboring stems, and strews the ground with wreck,\nAnd to their fall the hollow mountain thunders;\nThen dost thou guide me to the cave, where safe\nI learn to know myself, and from my breast\nDeep and mysterious wonders are unfolded.\nThen mounts the pure white moon before mine eye\nWith mellow ray, and in her softening light,\nFrom rocky wall, from humid brake, upfloat\nThe silvery shapes of times by-gone, and soothe\nThe painful pleasure of deep-brooding thought.\nAlas! that man enjoys no perfect bliss,\nI feel it now. Thou gav'st me with this joy,\nWhich brings me near and nearer to the gods,\nA fellow, whom I cannot do without.\nAll cold and heartless, he debases me\nBefore myself, and, with a single breath,\nBlows all the bounties of thy love to nought;\nAnd fans within my breast a raging fire\nFor that fair image, busy to do ill.\nThus reel I from desire on to enjoyment,\nAnd in enjoyment languish for desire.\n_Enter_ /Mephistopheles/.\nMephistopheles.\nWhat! not yet tired of meditation?\nMethinks this is a sorry recreation.\nTo try it once or twice might do;\nBut then, again to something new.\nFaust.\nYou might employ your time some better way\nThan thus to plague me on a happy day.\nMephistopheles.\nWell, well!

Neighborhood of Schirke and Elend._\n/Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/.\nMephistopheles.\nWould you not like a broomstick to bestride?\nWould God I had a stout old goat to ride!\nThe way is long; and I would rather spare me\nThis uphill work.\nFaust.\nWhile my good legs can bear me,\nThis knotted stick will serve my end.\nWhat boots it to cut short the way?\nThrough the long labyrinth of vales to wend,\nThese rugged mountain-steeps to climb,\nAnd hear the gushing waters' ceaseless chime,\nNo better seasoning on my wish to-day\nCould wait, to make the Brocken banquet prime!\nThe Spring is waving in the birchen bower,\nAnd ev'n the pine begins to feel its power;\nShall we alone be strangers to its sway?\nMephistopheles.\nNo whiff I feel that hath a smell of May;\nI am most wintry cold in every limb;\nI'd sooner track my road o'er frost and snow.\nHow sadly mounts the imperfect moon!--so dim\nShines forth its red disk, with belated glow,\nWe run the risk, at every step, on stones\nOr stumps of crazy trees, to break our bones.\nYou must allow me to request the aid\nOf a Will-o-the-Wisp;--I see one right ahead,\nAnd in the bog it blazes merrily.\nHolla! my good friend! dare I be so free?\nTwo travellers here stand much in need of thee;\nWhy should'st thou waste thy flickering flame in vain?\nPray be so good as light us up the hill!\nWill-o-the-Wisp.\nOut of respect to you, I will restrain,\nIf possible, my ever-shifting will;\nBut all our natural genius, and our skill\nIs zigzag; straight lines go against the grain.\nMephistopheles.\nHa! ha! hast learned from men how to declaim?\nMarch on, I tell thee, in the Devil's name!\nElse will I blow thy flickering life-spark out.\nWill-o-the-Wisp.\nYou are the master of the house, no doubt,\nAnd therefore I obey you cheerfully.\nOnly remember! 'tis the first of May,\nThe Brocken is as mad as mad can be;\nAnd when an _ignis fatuus_ leads the way,\nYou have yourselves to blame, if you should stray.\nFaust, Mephistopheles, and Will-o-the-Wisp. [_in reciprocal song_]\nThrough the realms of fairy dreaming,\nThrough the air with magic teeming,\nGuide us forward, guide us fairly,\nThanks to thee be rendered rarely;\nGuide us quick, and guide us sure,\nO'er the wide waste Brocken moor.\nTrees on trees thick massed before us\nFlit, and fling dark shadows o'er us,\nCliffs on cliffs in rugged masses\nNod above the narrow passes,\nAnd each rock from jagged nose,\nHow it snorts, and how it blows!\nOver turf and stones are pouring\nStream and streamlet, wildly roaring;\nIs it rustling? is it singing?\nLove's sweet plaint with gentle winging!\nVoices of those days, the dearest,\nWhen our light of hope was clearest!\nAnd the echo, like the sounds\nOf ancient story, back rebounds.\nOohoo! Shoohoo! what a riot!\nOwl and pewit, jay and piet!\nWill no bird to-night be quiet?\nWhat is this? red salamanders,\nWith long legs and swoll'n paunches,\nWeaving wreathy fire-meanders\nThrough the thicket's bristling branches!\nAnd the trees, their roots outspreading\nFrom the sand and rocky bedding,\nWinding, stretching, twisting grimly,\nThrough the dun air darting dimly\nSeek to seize us, seek to grasp us,\nAnd with snaky coils enclasp us!\nAnd the mice in motley muster,\nRed and white, and blue and grey,\nThick as bees that hang in cluster,\nCrowd along the heathy way.\nAnd the fire-flies shooting lightly\nThrough the weirdly winding glade,\nWith bewildering escort, brightly\nLead the streaming cavalcade!\nBut tell me, in this strange confusion,\nWhat is real, what delusion?\nDo we walk with forward faces,\nOr stand and halt with baffled paces?\nAll things seem to change their places,\nRocks and trees to make grimaces,\nAnd the lights in witchy row,\nTwinkle more and more they blow!\nMephistopheles.\nHold me tightly by the cue!\nFrom this hillock, we may view,\nAt leisure, with admiring gaze,\nHow Mammon in the mount doth blaze!\nFaust.\nHow strangely through the glooming glens\nDim sheen, like morning redness, glimmers!\nEv'n to the darkest, deepest dens\nWith its long streaky rays it shimmers.\nHere mounts the smoke, there rolls the steam,\nThere flames through the white vapors gleam,\nHere like a thread along the mountain\nIt creeps; there gushes in a fountain!\nHere stretching out, in many a rood,\nAlong the vale, its vein\u00e8d flood,\nAnd here at once it checks its flight,\nAnd bursts in globes of studded light.\nThere sparks are showering on the ground,\nLike golden sand besprinkled round,\nAnd lo! where all the rocky height,\nFrom head to foot is bathed in light!\nMephistopheles.\nHath not old Mammon lit with goodly flame\nHis palace for the jubilee?\nThou art in luck to see the game;\nEven now I scent the lusty company.\nFaust.\nHow the mad storm doth howl and hiss\nAnd beats my neck with angry buffeting!\nMephistopheles.\nTo the old mountain's hard ribs cling,\nOr the strong blast will hurl thee down the abyss;\nThe night with clouds is overcast;\nHear in the woods the grinding of the blast!\nHow the frightened owlets flit!\nHow the massive pillars split\nOf the dark pine-palaces!\nHow the branches creak and break!\nHow the riven stems are groaning!\nHow the gaping roots are moaning!\nIn terrible confusion all,\nOne on another clashing, they fall,\nAnd through the clefts, where their wrecks are buried,\nHissing and howling the winds are hurried.\nSounds of voices dost thou hear?\nVoices far, and voices near?\nAnd, all the mountain-side along,\nStreams a raving wizard song.\nWitches. [_in chorus_]\nThe witches to the Brocken ride,\nThe stubble is yellow, the corn is green;\nA merry crew to a merry scene,\nAnd good Sir Urian is the guide.[*n10]\nOver stock and stone we float,\nWrinkled hag and rank old goat.\nA Voice.\nOld mother Baubo comes up now,\nAlone, and riding on a sow.\nChorus.\nHonor to him to whom honor is due!\nLady Baubo heads the crew!\nOn the back of a sow, with the wings of the wind,\nAnd all the host of witches behind.\nA Voice.\nSister, which way came you?\nA Voice.\nBy Ilsenstein! and I looked into\nAn owlet's nest, as on I fared,\nThat with its two eyes broadly stared!\nA Voice.\nThe deuce! at what a devil's pace\nYou go; this march is not a race.\nA Voice.\nIt tore me, it flayed me!\nThese red wounds it made me!\nWitches. [_in chorus_]\nThe road is broad, the road is long,\nWhy crowd you so on one another?\nScrapes the besom, pricks the prong,\nChokes the child, and bursts the mother.\nWizards. [_semi-chorus_]\nWe trail us on, like very snails,\nThe women fly with flaunting sails;\nFor, when we run Squire Satan's races,\nThey always win by a thousand paces.\nSemi-Chorus.\nNot quite so bad: the women need\nA thousand paces to help their speed;\nBut let them speed what most they can,\nWith one spring comes up the man.\nVoice. [_from above_]\nCome up! come up from the lake with me.\nVoices. [_from below_]\nRight gladly would we mount with thee;\nWe wash, and wash, and cease from washing never;\nOur skins are as white as white can be,\nBut we are as dry and barren as ever.\nBoth Choruses.\nThe wind is hushed, the stars take flight,\nThe sullen moon hath veiled her light,\nThe magic choir from whizzing wings,\nLong lines of sparkling glory flings.\nVoice. [_from below_]\nStop, stop!\nVoice. [_from above_]\nWho bawls so loud from the cleft?\nVoice. [_from below_]\nLet me go with you! let me not be left!\nThree hundred years I grope and grope\nRound the base and up the slope,\nBut still the summit cheats my hope.\nI fain would be a merry guest\nAt Satan's banquet with the rest.\nBoth Choruses.\nOn broomstick, and on lusty goat,\nOn pitchfork, and on stick, we float;\nAnd he, to-day who cannot soar,\nIs a lost man for evermore.\nHalf-Witch. [_below_]\nI hobble on behind them all,\nThe others scarcely hear my call!\nI find no rest at home: and here,\nI limp on lamely in the rear.\nChorus of Witches.\nThe ointment gives our sinews might,[*n11]\nFor us each rag is sail enough,\nWe find a ship in every trough;\nWhoso will fly must fly to-night.\nBoth Choruses.\nWhile we upon the summit ride,\nBe yours to sweep along the side;\nUp and down, and far and wide,\nOn the left, and on the right,\nWitch and wizard massed together,\nScour the moor and sweep the heather,\nBravely on Walpurgis-night!\n[_They alight._\nMephistopheles.\nWhat a thronging, and jolting, and rolling, and rattling!\nWhat a whizzing, and whirling, and jostling, and battling!\nWhat a sparkling, and blazing, and stinking, and burning!\nAnd witches that all topsy-turvy are turning!--\nHold fast by me, or I shall lose you quite,\nWhere are you?\nFaust. [_at a distance_]\nHere!\nMephistopheles.\nWhat! so far in the rear!\nWhy then 'tis time that I should use my right,\nAs master of the house to-night.\nMake way! Squire Voland comes,[*n12] sweet mob, make way!\nHere, Doctor, hold by me!--and now, I say,\nWe must cut clear\nOf this wild hubbub, while we may;\nEven my cloth is puzzled here.\nSee'st thou that light on yonder mound quite near,\nIt hath a most peculiar glare,\nWe'll slip in there,\nAnd watch behind the bush the humors of the Fair.\nFaust.\nStrange son of contradiction!--may'st even guide us!\nA rare conceit! of course you must be right;\nThis weary way we march on famed Walpurgis night,\nLike hermits in a corner here to hide us!\nMephistopheles.\nLo! where the flames mount up with bickering glee;\nIn sooth it is a goodly company.\nIn such a place one cannot be alone.\nFaust.\nAnd yet a place I'd rather own\nUpon the top, where whirling smoke I see;\nThere thousands to the evil Spirit hie,\nAnd many a riddle there he will untie.\nMephistopheles.\nYes: and for every knot he disentangles,\nHe'll make another to produce new wrangles.\nLet the great world rant and riot,\nWe'll know to house us here in quiet;\nIn the great world 'tis a sanctioned plan,\nEach makes a little world the best he can.\nLook there; you see young witches without cover,\nAnd old ones prudently veiled over;\nYield but to me, and I can promise thee,\nWith little labor, mickle glee.\nI hear their noisy instruments begin!\nConfound their scraping!--one must bear the din.\nCome, come! what must be must be--let's go in!\nWith my good introduction on this night,\nThou shalt have laughter to thy heart's delight.\nWhat say'st thou, friend? this is no common show,\nA hundred lights are burning in a row,\nYou scarce may see the end;\nThey dance, they talk, they cook, they drink, they court;\nNow tell me, saw you ever better sport?\nFaust.\nSay, in what character do you intend\nTo appear here, and introduce your friend?\nDevil or conjurer?\nMephistopheles.\nI love incognito,\nYet on a gala-day my order I may show;\nAnd, though a garter here is but of small avail,\nThe famous horse's foot I ne'er yet knew to fail.\nSee even now that cautious creeping snail!\nWith her long feeling visage, she\nHas smelt out something of hell in me.\nDo what I can, they have a snout,\nIn this keen air to scent me out;\nCome! come; from fire to fire we roam; the game\nBe mine to start, and yours to woo the dame.\n[_To some who are sitting round a glimmering coal-fire._]\nWhy mope you here, old sirs, toasting your toes?\nMethinks your Brocken hours were better spent\nAmid the youthful roar and merriment;\nOne is enough alone at home, God knows.\nGeneral.\nWho would rely upon the faith of nations!\nThey leave you thankless, when their work is done;\nThe people, like the women, pour libations\nOnly in honor of the rising sun.\nMinister.\nThe liberties these modern changes bring,\nI must confess I cannot praise;\nThe good old times, when we were everything,\nThese were the truly golden days.\nParvenu.\nWe, too, pushed forward with the pushing crew,\nAnd for the need could stretch a point or two;\nBut now all's changed; and with the whirling bucket,\nWe lose the fruit, just when our hand would pluck it.\nAuthor.\nNo solid work now suits the reading nation,\nAnd year by year the world more shallow grows;\nAnd, for the glib-tongued rising generation,\nThey hang their wisdom on their up-turned nose!\nMephistopheles. [_Who all at once appears very old_]\nThe people here seem ripe for Doom's day; I\nSuspect the world is now on its last legs;\nAnd, since mine own good cask is running dry,\nMen and their ways, I guess, are near the dregs!\nPeddler-Witch.\nGood sirs, I pray you pass not by,\nCast on my wares a friendly eye!\nOne cannot see such rich display\nOf curious trinkets every day.\nYet is there nothing in my store\n(Which far all other stores excels),\nThat hath not done some mischief sore\nTo earth, and all on earth that dwells;\nNo dagger by which blood hath not been shed,\nNo cup from which, through sound and healthy life,\nCorroding fiery juice hath not been spread,\nNo gaud but hath seduced some lovely wife,\nNo sword that hath not made a truce miscarry,\nOr stabbed behind the back its adversary.\nMephistopheles.\nGood lady cousin! you come rather late.\nYour wares, believe me, are quite out of date;\nDeal in the new and newest; that\nOur palate smacks; all else is flat.\nFaust.\nThis is a fair that beats the Leipzig hollow!\nMy head is so confused, I scarce can follow.\nMephistopheles.\nTo the top the stream is rushing,\nAnd we are pushed, when we think we are pushing.\nFaust.\nWho, then, is that?\nMephistopheles.\nLook at her well.\n'Tis Lilith.[*n13]\nFaust.\nWho?\nMephistopheles.\nAdam's first wife. Beware,\nArt thou a wise man, of her glossy hair!\n'Tis fair to look on, but its look is fell.\nThose locks with which she outshines all the train,\nWhen she hath bound a young man with that chain,\nShe'll hold him fast; he'll scarce come back again.\nFaust.\nThere sit an old and young one on the sward;\nThey seem to have been dancing somewhat hard.\nMephistopheles.\nO! once begun, they'll go on like the devil.\nCome, come! they rise again--let's join the revel.\n[/Faust/ _and_ /Mephistopheles/ _join the dance; the former\nwith the Young Witch as his partner; the latter with the Old one._\nFaust. [_dancing with the young Witch_]\nA lovely dream once came to me,\nI saw in my sleep an apple-tree;\nTwo lovely apples on it did shine;\nI clomb the pole to make them mine.\nThe Young Witch.\nFor apples your sire in Paradise\nAnd primal dame had longing eyes:\nAnd, if your eyes are wise to see,\nYou'll find such apples on my tree.\nMephistopheles. [_dancing with the old Witch_]\nAn ugly dream once came to me,\nI dreamed I saw a cloven tree;\nIn the tree there sat an ugly owl;\nI called it fair, though it was foul.\nThe Old Witch.\nMy best salute this night shall be,\nThou knight of the cloven foot, to thee;\nA cloven tree with an ugly owl,\nAnd I for thee, or fair, or foul.\nProctophantasmist.[*n14] [_to the dancers_]\nListen to order, you presumptuous brood!\nHave we not proved beyond disputing,\nThat ghosts on terra firma have no footing?\nAnd yet you dance like any flesh and blood?\nThe Young Witch. [_dancing_]\nWhat wants he here, that rude-like fellow there?\nFaust. [_dancing_]\nO, he is everywhere!\nWhat others dance 'tis his to prize;\nEach step he cannot criticise\nHad as well not been made. But in the dance\nIt grieves him most when we advance.\nIf we would wheel still round and round in a ring,\nAs he is fond to do in his old mill,\nHe would not take it half so ill;\nEspecially if you take care to bring\nYour praiseful offering to his master skill.\nProctophantasmist.\nWhat! still there, phantoms? this is past endurance!\nIn this enlightened age you have the assurance\nTo show your face and play your tricks undaunted;\nWe are so wise, and yet a man's own house is haunted.\nHow long have I not swept the cobwebs of delusion,\nAnd still the world remains in the same wild confusion!\nThe Young Witch.\nBe quiet then, and seek some other place!\nProctophantasmist.\nI tell you, Spirits, in your face,\nThis intellectual thrall I cannot bear it;\nI love to have a free unshackled spirit. [_The dance goes on._]\nTo-day I see that all my strength is spent in vain;\nI've had a tour, at least, to compensate my evils,\nAnd hope, before I come to Blocksberg back again,\nTo crush, with one good stroke, the poets and the devils.\nMephistopheles.\nHe will now go, and, bare of breeches,\nSit in a pool with solemn patience;\nAnd, when his buttocks are well sucked by leeches,\nBe cured of ghosts and ghostly inspirations.\n[_To_ /Faust/, _who has just left the dance._]\nWhy do you let the lovely damsel go,\nThat in the dance with sweet song pleased you so?\nFaust.\nAlas! while she so passing sweet was singing,\nI saw a red mouse from her mouth outspringing.\nMephistopheles.\nPooh! on the Brocken that's a thing of course;\nLet not such trifles mar your sweet discourse.\nGo, join the crew, and dance away;\nEnough, the red mouse was not gray.\nFaust.\nThen saw I--\nMephistopheles.\nWhat?\nFaust.\nMephisto, see'st thou there\nA pale yet lovely girl, in lonely distance fare?\nFrom place to place she moveth slow;\nWith shackled feet she seems to go;\nI must confess, she has a cast\nOf Margaret, when I saw her last.\nMephistopheles.\nLet that alone! it brings thee certain harm;\nIt is bewitched, a bloodless, breathless form,\nFor men to look upon it is not good.\nIts fix\u00e8d gaze hath power to freeze the blood,\nAnd petrify thee stark and stiff.\nOf course I need not ask you if\nYou've heard of the Medusa's head.\nFaust.\nIn truth I see the eyes of one that's dead,\nOn which no closing hand of love was laid.\nThat is my Margaret's kindly breast,\nThat the sweet body I caressed.\nMephistopheles.\nThere lies the witchcraft o't, thou fool!\nA phantom takes thy wit to school:\nShe is the love of every lover's brain.\nFaust.\nWhat ecstasy! and yet what pain!\nI cannot leave it for my life.\nHow strangely this most lovely neck\nA single streak of red doth deck,\nNo broader than the back o' a knife!\nMephistopheles.\nQuite right! I see it, just as well as you.\nSometimes her head beneath her elbow too\nShe wears; for Perseus cut it off, you know.\nWhat! will you still a-dreaming go?\nCome, let us mount the hillock--there\nWe shall have noble sport, believe me;\nFor, unless mine eyes deceive me,\nThey have got up a theatre.\nWhat make you here?\nA Servant.\nYou are just come in time.\n'Tis a new piece, the last of all the seven,\nFor such the number that with us is given.\nA dilettante 'twas that wrote the rhyme,\nAnd dilettanti are the actors too.\nExcuse me, sirs,--no disrespect to you,\nIf I seem curt: I am the dilettante\nTo draw the curtain; and our time is scanty.\nMephistopheles.\nJust so; I only wish you were so clever\nTo know your home;\nThen from the Blocksberg you would never\nHave lust to roam!\nScene II.",

Stand and confront me with\nthy insupportable presence. A prisoner! in irredeemable misery! given\nover to evil Spirits, and to the condemning voice of the unfeeling\nworld! and me, meanwhile, thou cradlest to sleep amid a host of the\nmost vapid dissipations, concealing from my knowledge her aggravated\nwoes!--while she--she is left in hopeless wretchedness to die!\nMephistopheles.\nShe's not the first.\nFaust.\nDog! abominable monster!--Change him, O thou infinite Spirit! change\nthe reptile back again into his original form--the poodle that ran\nbefore me in the twilight, now cowering at the feet of the harmless\nwanderer, now springing on his shoulders!--Change him again into his\nfavorite shape, that he may crouch on his belly in the sand before\nme, and I may tramp him underneath my feet, the reprobate!--Not the\nfirst! Misery, misery! by no human soul to be conceived! that more\nthan one creature of God should ever have been plunged into the depth\nof this woe! that the first, in the writhing agony of her death,\nshould not have atoned for the guilt of all the rest before the eyes\nof the All-merciful! It digs even into the marrow of my life, the\nmisery of this _one_; and thou--thou grinnest in cold composure over\nthe wretchedness of thousands!\nMephistopheles.\nHere we are arrived once more at the limit of our wits, where the\nthread of human reason snaps in sunder. Wherefore seekest thou\ncommunion with us, unless thou would'st carry it through? Would'st\nfly, and yet art not proof against giddiness?

To smash the innocent in pieces is the proper tyrant's\nfashion of venting one's spleen in a dilemma.\nFaust.\nBring me to her! She shall be free!\nMephistopheles.\nAnd the danger to which thou exposest thyself! Know that the guilt of\nblood from thy hand still lies upon the town. Above the spot where\nthe slain fell, avenging Spirits hover and lie in wait for the\nreturning murderer.\nFaust.\nThat too from thee? Murder and death of a world on thee, thou\nmonster! Bring me to her, I say, and deliver her!\nMephistopheles.\nI'll lead thee thither, and what I can do that I will do. Mark me!\nHave I all power in heaven and on earth? I will cloud the wits of\nthe warder, and thou may'st seize the keys, and bring her out with\nthe hand of a man. I wait for you with the magic horses to ensure\nyour escape.

Quick!\nSave thy poor child!\nAway, away!\nKeep the path\nUp the stream,\nAcross the bridge,\nTo the left hand,\nWhere the plank stands,\nIn the pond,\nSeize it, quick!\nIt rises up,\nIt kicks! it lives!\nO save it, save it!\nFaust.\nOnly bethink thee!\nOne step more, and thou art free.\nMargaret.\nWould we were past that mountain gray!\nThere sits my mother on a stone--\nI feel a hand that pulls me back\nAs cold as clay!\nThere sits my mother on a stone;\nHer head sways heavily;\nShe winks not, she nods not, her head she may not raise.\nShe slept so long, she never more may wake.\nShe slept that we might our enjoyment take.\nO these were happy days!\nFaust.\nHere words and prayers will only make things worse;\nCome! come; or I must hale thee hence by force.\nMargaret.\nLet me alone! lay no rough hands on me!\nNor with such murderous clutches seize me!\nThou know'st I have done everything to please thee.\nFaust.\nThe day dawns. Come, my Gretchen, follow me!\nMargaret.\nDay! yes, it is day! the Judgment-day breaks in!\nMy marriage-day it should have been!\nLet no one know thou wert before with Margaret.\nWoe to my wreath!\n'Tis done! oh, pain!\nWe will meet again;\nBut not at the dance.\nThe thronging crowds advance\nWith bated breath;\nNo word is spoken;\nThe squares, the streets,\nCannot contain them all.\nThe bell doth call,\nThe staff is broken,\nThey bind me with cords, they drag me away,\nAnd on the bloody block me lay;\nAnd every trembling eye doth quake\nAt the blade that is brandished o'er my neck.\nMute lies the world as the grave!\nFaust.\nO had I ne'er been born!\nMephistopheles. [_appearing from without_]\nUp! or no help can save!\nProfitless whining, whimpering, and prating!\nMeanwhile my eager steeds are waiting,\nSnuffing the scent of the morning air.\nMargaret.\nWhat's that from the floor uprising there?\n'Tis he! 'Tis he! O send his hateful face\nAway! What seeks he in this holy place?\nHe comes for me!\nFaust.\nNo! thou shalt live.\nMargaret.\nJudgment of God! to thee my soul I give.\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nCome, come! else will I leave you to your fate!\nMargaret.\nThine am I, Father! O shut not the gate\nOf mercy on me!\nYe angels! ye most holy Spirits! now\nEncamp around me! and protect me now!\nHenry, I tremble when I think on thee.\nMephistopheles.\nShe is judged!\nVoice. [_from above_]\nIs saved!\nMephistopheles. [_to_ /Faust/]\nHither to me!\nVoice. [_from within, dying away_]\nHenry! Henry!\n[The End]",
