      "text": "touched with radiance the figure of a young girl who was standing by a\nwhite gate which led into a copse sloping upward to the crest of a hill,\nbehind the old manor, and crowned by a belt of fir-trees.\nJoyce had her hand on the latch of the gate, but paused for a moment to\nlook back on the landscape which lay stretched out before her.\nA peaceful valley was below, where the tower of Fair Acres church rose\nagainst a background of trees, now in their first fresh beauty. A few\ncottages with red roofs clustered round the church, and two or three\nfarms were sprinkled at a farther distance. A rugged outline of hills at\na higher level, showed where the Ebbor rocks open out a miniature\nCheddar, and on the other side of that little gorge lay the open\ncountry, where the city of the deep springs lies, with its noble\ncathedral, and quaint Close, and stately baronial Palace--the beautiful\ncathedral village of Wells.\nJoyce Falconer was looking forth upon life as upon this goodly\nlandscape. She was in the fresh spring-time of seventeen summers. Her\nfather called her Sunshine, and her brothers Birdie; while her mother,\nwho was a plain, practical person, and who indulged in no flights of\nfancy, would say, \"Joyce is the child's name; and what can suit her\nbetter? I don't like nick-names.\"\nNevertheless the nick-names held their own, and as Joyce stood by the\nwhite gate, a voice was heard resounding from the lawn below:\n\"Hallo, Sunshine!\"\n\"Father, come up the hill. It is so lovely this morning.\"\nThe squire advanced with steady, even footsteps. He was a fine, stalwart\nman, dressed in a stout suit of corduroy, and with leggings buttoned up\nto his knees. He carried a gun under his arm--more from habit than from\nany idea of using it just then--and close at his heels walked, with\nsedate and leisurely bearing, his chief friend and companion, a large\nretriever, Duke; while two little terriers, Nip and Pip, bustled about\nin every direction, scenting with their sharp noses, and occasionally\nturning upon each other to have a playful passage of arms which, though\naccompanied by ominous growls, meant nothing but fun.\n\"I am up first to-day, daddy!\" Joyce exclaimed, as she went down the\ngentle descent and linked her arm in her father's. \"I am first, and is\nnot it beautiful to be alive on such a day?\"\nThe squire paused, and putting his arm round his daughter's waist, he\nsaid, looking down at her with eyes of loving pride:\n\"Beautiful! yes,\" thinking, though he did not say so, that the most\nbeautiful thing in all that beautiful world was his little Sunshine, his\ndarling Joyce.\n\"I hope the weather will keep fine for the hay,\" he said; \"but the glass\nwent up with a gallop yesterday; still, it looks fair enough this\nmorning.\"\n\"When are we to begin to cut the grass, daddy?\"\n\"To-morrow, in the home meadow,\" was the reply. \"I am going into Wells\nto-day, for the magistrates' meeting.\"\n\"May I come, father?\"\n\"Well, I've no objection, if mother has not,\" was the answer. \"You must\nask her leave.\"\n\"I expect she will let me come. She is sure to have some shopping to do;\nand you don't like commissions at shops, daddy.\"\nThe squire gave a significant shrug of his broad shoulders, and then the\ntwo began to thread their way through the copse, and came out at last on\nthe side of the grass-covered hill, up which Joyce skipped with the\nlight step of a young fawn, with Nip and Pip scuffling along with her in\nthe highest glee, while the squire and Duke followed more slowly.",

      "text": "As she stood there in the light of the morning, Joyce Falconer was a\nfair picture of happy, joyous maidenhood. Her figure was lithe and\nsupple, and though I am afraid her lilac cotton frock would be despised\nas only fit for a maid-servant in these days, it became her well. It was\nmade with a full skirt and a loose body, cut rather low at the neck,\nwith sleeves which were large on the shoulder, gradually tightening to\nthe wrist, and displayed to advantage a well-rounded arm. Joyce's shoes\nwere thick; but though, perhaps, a trifle clumsy, they did not spoil the\nsymmetry of her pretty ankle and high-arched instep. Snowy \"tuckers\" of\ncrimped muslin were sewn into the neck and wrists of her gown, and she\nwore an apron with a bib; an old-fashioned apron, guiltless of bows or\nlace.\nHer abundant chestnut hair was gathered on the top of her small head,\nand fell in curls on either side of her smooth white brow; not concealed\nnow by the large Dunstable straw bonnet, which was hanging to her arm by\nthe strings, and left the gentle breeze of the morning free, to play\namongst the clustering curls, at their own sweet will.\nJoyce's features were regular, and her complexion rosy and healthy.\nIndeed, everything about her seemed to tell of youth and the full\nenjoyment of the gifts which God had given her.\n\"A perfect little rustic!\" her aunt in the Vicar's close at Wells called\nher sometimes, and would suggest to her father that a year or two at a\n\"finishing school\" would be an advantage.\nBut the squire could not bring himself to part from his only daughter,\nand her education had been, I am afraid, sadly neglected.\n\"Well, little one,\" Mr. Falconer said, as he seated himself on a rough\nwooden bench, \"what is this?\" touching the cover of a book that peeped\nfrom her apron pocket.\n\"It is a book, father, Charlotte lent me: Mrs. Hemans' poems.\"\n\"Ah! poetry is a good thing when it is kept in its right place.\"\n\"I have been learning a long poem called 'Edith,' and I repeat it when I\nam darning stockings, picking up a stitch for every word. Don't you\nunderstand, father?\"\n\"I never darned a stocking,\" he said, laughing.\n\"Ah! happy father! Mother has now given me six pairs of Melville's new\nsocks, to strengthen the heels. In and out, in and out with the long\nneedle; I have to try very hard not to grumble, so I say 'Edith' as a\ncomfort, and to help me on.\"\n'The woods--oh! solemn are the boundless woods\nOf the great Western world when day declines,\nAnd louder sounds the roll of distant floods,\nMore deep the rustling of the solemn pines;\nWhen darkness gathers o'er the stilly air,\nAnd mystery seems o'er every leaf to brood,\nAwful it is for human heart to bear\nThe weight and burden of the solitude.'\n\"Father,\" she said, suddenly stopping, \"you are thinking of something\nthat troubles you. I know it by the deep line on your forehead, between\nyour eyes. May I know, father?\"\n\"Well, Sunshine, I am troubled about Melville; he wants to go and see\nthe world, he says. I have given him as good an education as befits his\nstation in life. He has made little use of it; and the bills for the\nlast term at Oxford have been enormous.\"\n\"How shameful!\" Joyce exclaimed.\n\"Things are so different from what they were when I was a boy,\" the\nsquire said. \"Why, I never dreamed of anything beyond doing my duty\nhere. I took the farming business off your grandfather's shoulders\nbefore I was five-and-twenty. I was his steward, as Melville ought to be\nmine, and leave me free. As it is, I have to pay Watson, and look into\neverything myself, when I have a son of three-and-twenty, who ought to\ndo all this for me. I suppose it can't be helped,\" the squire said,\nstretching out his legs, and taking up the gun which had been resting\nagainst the bench, \"and as far as I can see the younger boys will be\nvery little, if any, better than Melville.\"\n\"Oh! yes, father. Ralph will do anything you wish, I know; and Hal and\nBunny are very good at school. Remember what the master said of them at\nChristmas.\"\n\"Yes, yes; they are good little fellows. Then there is poor Piers; he\nmust always be an anxiety, poor boy!\"\n\"I don't think any of us can be happier than Piers,\" Joyce said. \"He\nnever complains because he is lame; and he is as contented as possible,\nmaking his collection of moths and butterflies, and bird's eggs, and\nthings. No, father, don't be unhappy about Piers.\"\n\"Do you think, Joyce, I ever forget that it was my carelessness which\nmade the boy a cripple? I never forget it.\"\n\"No one else thinks of it, dear daddy,\" Joyce said, slipping her hand\ninto her father's, as it rested on his knee. \"No one else thinks of it;\nand you know the colt had been broken in, and----\"\n\"The child ought never to have put his legs across it, Joyce; and I\nlifted him on, and told him not to be a coward. Ah!\" said the squire,\nsuddenly starting to his feet. \"I cannot speak of it; I dare not.\"\nHe began an abrupt descent the way that they had come. Nip and Pip, who\nhad been sleeping with their noses on their paws, and one eye open,\nraced off, while Duke drew himself into a standing position, and walked\ndemurely down the steep bit of turf, with the brush of his tail waving\nfrom side to side as he went.\nJoyce did not follow immediately. Her bright face was clouded with the\nsympathy she felt for her father. It all came back to her: the group\nbefore the Manor, the child of eight years old, saying, \"I am afraid of\nriding Rioter, father.\" Then the father's answer, \"Afraid! Don't be a\ncoward, Piers; you have a good seat enough for such a little chap. Here,\nlet me put you on.\" The boy's white, set face, as he grasped the reins;\nand Rioter was off like lightning. \"His brothers rode long before they\nwere his age,\" the squire had said; \"it won't do to tie him to his\nmother's apron strings, because he happens to be the youngest.\" Then the\nsound of returning horse's feet, and Rioter rushed up the side drive to\nthe stables riderless. Another minute and old Thomas appeared with a\nlifeless burden in his arms, which the squire took from him, with a\ngroan of remorse, as he turned into the house with him and said to his\nwife, \"I have killed the boy.\"\nBut Piers was not killed. His injuries were life-long, but his life was\nspared.\nWhether it was from an instinctive feeling, that his father considered\nhimself the cause of his lameness and generally invalided condition, or\nwhether the latent buoyancy of his nature asserted itself above all the\nprivations which the accident had brought upon him, or whether both of\nthese causes were at work within him, certain it is that Piers was the\nmost cheerful and most uncomplaining member of the squire's household,\nand never allowed any one to pity him, or to treat him as an object of\ncompassion. Joyce was right when she said that no one was happier than",

Here, rummage in my\npocket, left-hand side--there he is! He is a perfect specimen, and a\npretty rare one. The stable-boy found him lying on his back under the\ndove-cot. Perhaps he got the worst of it in a fight. Anyhow, he is dead,\nand I have a nice nook for him in my big case.\"\n\"Poor dear little birdie,\" Joyce said, stroking the soft feathers. \"Oh!\nPiers, why must everything die? It seems so hard. And this is the\npuzzle, that we--you and I--may die to-day, next week, any day; and yet\nwe don't really behave as if we believed it. I feel on a morning like\nthis, for instance, so full of life, it is so delicious to live, and as\nif I never could die. It is so beautiful to be living, so sad to be\ndead! To think, Piers, of this little bird singing sweetly----\"\n\"Sparrow-hawks don't sing very sweetly; they chirrup and whistle,\" Piers\ninterrupted.\n\"Ah, well, he thought he sang sweetly, and so did his mother; so it came\nto the same thing. Poor little sweet.\" And Joyce held the little\nlifeless bird against her rounded chin and pressed her lips upon it.\nSuddenly Piers said:\n\"What is wrong about Melville; there's something fresh, for I heard my\nmother talking about it before I was up.\"\n\"He says he won't come here and take care of the farm. He wants to\ntravel.\"\n\"Well, I don't blame him for that,\" said Piers.\n\"But his debts have hampered father dreadfully I know, and he does so\ndetest his fine gentleman airs. It seems to me,\" said Joyce, vehemently,\n\"to be ashamed of a father like ours is--Oh! I have no word bad enough,\nand Melville _is_ ashamed, and he does not like mother looking after the\ndairy and the butter.\"\n\"Well,\" said Piers, tapping his crutch upon the ground, \"I think mother\ndoes fidget and worry too much in the house and about the place; but it\nis her way, and no one could alter it.\"\n\"I don't know that I wish to alter it,\" Joyce said, hotly. \"Mother has\ndone so much for us, and I hate to think she is slighted by her\nchildren. Melville _does_ slight her, and when he talks in that\ndrawling, affected voice, and ties his starched cravats twenty times,\nand flings them down again if the bow is crooked. I despise _him_, and\nthat is the truth.\"\nPiers shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Well, we must go back to breakfast,\" he said; \"I am hungry, and it must\nbe nearly eight o'clock.\"\nThe brother and sister walked slowly towards the house, and as they\ncrossed the lawn, from which the sun had kissed away all the dewdrops, a\nbell over the stables rang, and a little alert figure appeared in the\nporch.\n\"Joyce, Joyce! What are you dawdling for? It is past eight o'clock.\nGetting your feet drenched with the dew, I'll warrant. No, don't bring\nany dead birds here, Piers; I won't have it.

I shall be all behindhand, if I don't look out. I wish\nMelville's fine gentleman visitor farther!\"\nMrs. Falconer spoke rapidly, and in rather a high key. Her accent was\ndecidedly provincial, and she did not measure out her words with the\nslow precision which her eldest son Melville considered a mark of _bon\nton_.\nMrs. Falconer was the daughter of a large farmer in a neighbouring\ncounty, and the squire had married her in haste, though he had never\nrepented at leisure.\nShe was thoroughly loyal-hearted and true as a wife and mother; brusque\nand blunt, holding all fine things and fine people in supreme contempt.\nAnd yet, according to the perversity of women-kind, she spoiled and\nindulged the son whose love of fine things seemed likely to be his bane,\nand brought perpetual trouble upon his good and honourable father.\nTo make bread and cakes, to skim milk, churn butter, at a pinch, and\nmake all the sweet, cooling drinks for the summer, and elderberry wine\nfor the winter, were domestic duties in which Mrs. Falconer gloried. She\nwould put on a large apron and a pair of dusting-gloves every morning\nand go the round of the parlours, and rub the old mahogany chair-backs\nand bureau with vigour, sprinkle the tea-leaves on stated days, and\nfollow one of her stout maid-servants, as they swept the carpets on\ntheir knees, with dustpan and brush, and remove every suspicion of\n\"fluff\" from every corner or crevice where it might be supposed to\naccumulate.\nWhile her children were young these household duties which their mother\ntook upon herself, were considered as a matter of course, but with added\nyears came added wisdom, to some of them at least, and Melville, her\neldest son, and her great darling and idol, began to show unmistakable\nsigns of annoyance, at his mother's household accomplishments.\nHe was at home now, and a stormy scene the night before had deepened the\nlines on the squire's brow; and hard things Melville had said were as\nsharp swords to his mother's soul. She was not particularly sensitive,\nit is true; by no means thin-skinned, or laying herself out--as is the\nfashion of some women of her temperament, to take offence. Still,\nMelville had succeeded the night before in wounding her in her tenderest\nplace, reminding her that while his father's pedigree could be stretched\nout to meet the royal blood of the Saxon kings, the race of sturdy\nyeomen, from which his mother came, had no blue blood in their veins and\nwere sons of the soil.\nThere is an old saying that \"sharper than a serpent's tooth is an\nungrateful child;\" and Mrs. Falconer was still smarting from the wound\ngiven her the evening before, when she began to dispense the excellent\nbreakfast, laid in a large, cool hall at the back of the manor, which\nwas connected, by a square opening in the thick wall, with the kitchen.\nThe squire, who was generally so jovial and cheery, ate his cold pressed\nbeef and drank his glass of \"home-brew\" in silence. He professed to be\nengrossed with a Bath paper several days old, and did not invite\nconversation.\nPiers played with some bread-and-milk his mother set before him: his\nappetite was never good; but Joyce despatched hot rolls and ham with a\ngreat appetite, which I am afraid would shock some of our modern notions\nnowadays.\nTea and coffee were not the staple beverages at breakfast in those\ntimes; but when the heavier part of the meal was over Joyce handed her\nfather a fragrant cup, with some thin toast done to a turn, for which\nMrs. Falconer called from the kitchen through the window, communicating\nwith it, and fitted with a sliding shutter, which was promptly closed\nwhen the tray had been received from the hands of one of the maids.\n\"So you are thinking of going into Wells to-day, Arthur?\" Mrs. Falconer\nsaid when, breakfast drawing to a conclusion, she began to pile the\nplates together, and put all the scraps on one, for the benefit of Nip\nand Pip, who had been lying in the window-seat for the past half-hour in\na state of suppressed excitement, with their noses on their paws, and\ntheir eyes fixed upon that end of the table where their mistress\npresided.\nThe noise made by the piling up of the plates was now a decided\nmovement, and Nip and Pip began to wriggle and leap, and finally subside\non their hind legs as Joyce called out: \"Trust, Nip! trust, Pip!\" and\nthen, after what she considered a due time spent in an erect position,\nthe plate was put down before them, and its contents vanished in a\ntwinkling.\n\"Well, Joyce, will you be ready by eleven o'clock?\" Mr. Falconer asked\nas he left the room.\nJoyce was silent, and her mother said:\n\"Yes, yes, she shall be ready; if she is brisk she can get through all I\nwant.\" Then Mrs. Falconer began to put all the silver into a wooden\nbowl, and rubbed it herself with the washleather when it was dried.\nShe had just finished this part of her daily routine when the door",

      "text": "opened and her son Melville came in. His appearance would be ridiculous\nin the eyes of the dandies of to-day, but in his own, at least, it was\nas near perfection as possible.\nHis hair was curled in tight and very-much-oiled curls on his forehead\nand round his ears. He wore a high neckcloth, tied evidently with much\ncare, supporting his retreating chin. His coat was of Lincoln green,\nvery short in the waist, with large silver buttons, and turned back with\na wide collar to display two waistcoats, the white one only showing an\nedge beyond the darker one of deep salmon-colour, which opened to set\noff a frilled shirt. The trousers were tight, and caught at the ankles\nby straps, and his shoes were tied with large bows. The servile\nimitators of \"the first gentleman in Europe\" followed in his steps with\nas much precision as possible, and Melville Falconer spared no pains to\nlet the county folk of Somersetshire see what the real scion of _bon\nton_ looked like.\nMelville had a pleasant, weak face; he was almost entirely forgetful of\nthe interests or tastes of anyone but himself, and he had never given up\nhis own wishes for the sake of another in his life.\nHe had a ridiculous idea of his own importance, and a supreme contempt\nfor what he called old-fashioned usage; from the vantage-ground of\nsuperior wisdom he looked down on the county gentry of Somersetshire,\nwho, in those days, did not frequent London in the season, or tread hard\non the heels of the nobility in all their customs, as is now the case.\nThe great mercantile wealth which rose into colossal importance, when\nrailway traffic brought the small towns near the large ones, and the\nlarge ones near the metropolis, had not begun to overshadow the land;\nthe tide of speculation had not set in; and there was less hastening to\nbe rich and desire to display all that riches could give. It was a time\nof comparative stagnation, which preceded the great rush, which was to\nbear on its tide, as the stream of progress and discovery gathered\nstrength, the next generation with relentless power. Of all that lay\noutside Fair Acres, Mrs. Falconer was almost indifferent, if not\nignorant. She liked things as they were, and was averse to change, lest\nthat change should be for the worse. Her tongue, which was a sharp one,\nhad been swift to condemn the establishment of the schools in her\nneighbourhood, and she resisted all invitations from her husband to make\nthe acquaintance of Mrs. Hannah More. Teaching lads and lasses to read\nand write was, in the opinion of Mrs. Falconer, a crying evil. They had\nenough learning if they kept their church once a week, and as to\narithmetic, if they could count their own fingers it was enough; and\nshe, for one, would never take a servant who had schooling. \"A pack of\nnonsense,\" she called it; and she would tell Mrs. Hannah More so if only\nshe had the chance. Mrs. Falconer turned from her occupation at the\ntable, when her son entered.\n\"Breakfast!\" she exclaimed. \"No, indeed; breakfast is over and done\nwith. I can't keep the things about half the morning.\"\nThe prototype of the fine gentleman seated himself in a chair at the\ntable, and said in a drawling voice, suppressing a yawn:\n\"Joyce, get me some clean plates, and go and order a rasher of bacon;\nand let the eggs be poached; and----\"\nBut Mrs. Falconer pushed Joyce aside:\n\"No,\" she said; \"your sister has something else to do than wait on you.\nI'll get your breakfast; and if you have to wait an hour, it will serve\nyou right; lie-a-beds don't generally have sharp appetites.\"\n\"Nay, mother,\" Melville said, \"do not let the want of appetite be laid\nto my door, with so many other sins; I am particularly hungry this\nmorning. And I beseech you, do not do servant's work for _me_.\"\nMrs. Falconer's face betrayed that she felt the thrust.\n\"Servant's work must be done for folks too lazy to do it for\nthemselves,\" she said, as she let the heavy door swing behind her, and\nrepaired to the kitchen to prepare, far too carefully, a breakfast for\nher son.\nJoyce hesitated a moment, and then said:\n\"It always vexes mother when you are late, Melville. I wish you would\nget up earlier.\"\n\"My dear little sister, I should have vexed mother if I had come down at\nsix. She is out of temper with me, and so is my father, simply because I\ndesire to get a little education, to fit me for my position here, you\nknow, when I come into the place.\"\n\"Oh, Melville, you have had every advantage; you ought to know\neverything. But Aunt Letitia was quite right--the money spent upon you\nat Oxford was wasted.\"\n\"Thanks for your high opinion. I ought to be vastly grateful for it. But\nto speak of other things: I have bidden a friend to stay here for a\nweek. He will like country air, and to drink milk and curds-and-whey. He\narrives at Wells by the Bath mail; and I shall drive in with you and my\nfather, and hire a post-chaise at the Swan to bring him out.\"\n\"I hope he is not a fine gentleman,\" Joyce said.\n\"He is a very fine gentleman indeed,\" was the answer; \"and, Joyce,\npersuade mother _not_ to put on that big bib, and make herself look like\na housekeeper. It will appal Arundel, and make him feel out of his\nelement.\"\n\"If he is to feel that, what does he come for?\" Joyce said, angrily. \"We\nwant no upstarts here.\"\n\"Upstarts! that is fine talking. Arundel comes of one of the oldest\nfamilies in England. Not older than ours; though, unhappily, we live as\nif we had sprung from the gutter, and do not get any proper respect.\"\n\"Respect!\" exclaimed Joyce, indignantly. \"Respect! As if father were not\nrespected as a justice! and as if _you_----\" Joyce stopped; she felt too\nindignant to go on.\n\"My dear little sister,\" Melville said, with a grand air of pity--\"my\ndear little sister, you are only ignorant. If you knew a little more of\nthe habits and customs of the higher classes, you would not talk so\nfoolishly.\"\n\"I do not wish to know more about them if you have got _your_ habits\nfrom associating with them.\"\nMelville smiled, and did not betray the least irritation.\n\"My dear,\" he said, \"facts are stubborn things. Does it never strike\nyou, that though my father dines at the houses of the gentry in the\ncounty, sits on the bench, and rides to cover, you and my mother are not\ninvited to accompany him. The truth is my good mother dislikes the\nusages of _genteel_ life.\"\nMelville used that objectionable word with emphasis. Genteel was in\nthose days used as some of us now use words which are scarcely more\nsignificant, though generally accepted--\"Good form,\" \"A 1,\" and so\nforth.\n\"It is,\" Melville continued, grandly, \"the result of early associations;\nand so we eat heavy one o'clock meals and nine o'clock suppers, instead\nof dining at three or four o'clock; and my mother, instead of receiving\ncompany in the house, works in it like a servant. It is a vast pity, my\ndear. It keeps the family down, and destroys your chances in life. So I\nadvise you to try to alter things. Now Arundel is coming, I want to dine\nat a less outlandish hour, and I----\"\nWhatever Mr. Melville Falconer wanted Joyce did not stay to hear. She\nleft the large hall by one door as her mother entered by the other,\nbearing in her hand a tray of delicately prepared breakfast for her\nson, who was wholly unworthy of her attentions, and would have been\nbetter without them.\n\"Thank you, mother,\" Melville said. \"I hope the toast is not dried up.\nThere is so much skill even in the poaching of an egg.\"\n\"There are two ways of doing everything,\" was Mrs. Falconer's rejoinder.\n\"Now I must be quick, for I have a deal of work upstairs.\"\n\"Why should you have work, mother?\"\n\"Why did you invite a fine gentleman here? You had better answer that\nquestion. The best room must be got ready, and the feather bed laid\nbefore the fire.\"\n\"A fire in this weather!\" exclaimed Melville.\n\"No one ever sleeps in my house in an unaired bed; and never will, while\nI am mistress of it, that I can tell you. I hope your fine gentleman is\nnot one to scoff at plain people.\"\n\"Arundel is far too well bred to make invidious remarks. But for all\nthat, things may strike him as a little odd. I was going to suggest that\nwe should dine at four o'clock while he is here, and that the boys\nshould not sit down with us elders. It is not the custom in great\nhouses.\"\n\"It is the custom here, and mine is _not_ a great house: it is a\ncomfortable English home, where there is no waste, and no extravagance,\nand no show. I'll warrant your grand friend never slept in a better bed\nnor between finer sheets than he will to-night. They are as sweet as\nlavender can make them, and----\"\nMelville shrugged his shoulders.\n\"Nay, spare me, mother, and let us leave the arrangements of\nbed-chambers to the fitting people. And, if I might suggest it, let all\nthings wear their best appearance when Arundel arrives, including the\nmistress of the mansion. It is a pity when one so young and\ncomely-looking as my mother should pay such scant heed to the little\nfeminine ornaments which are----Phaugh! what is this? Positively a red\nant crawling from the bread-trencher. What a beast! Quick! catch it,\nmother. I hope we shall have no red ants when Arundel is here.\"\nMrs. Falconer darted down upon the ant with her forefinger, and speedily\ndespatched it, exclaiming there was a perfect plague of ants in the\nlarder, and she did not know how to be rid of them.\n\"Disgusting!\" said her son, carefully covering the body of the ant with\na leaf which had garnished the pat of butter. \"It is enough to make one\nsick. I must have a little brandy to settle myself, or rather, my\nbreakfast, before I start.\"\nMrs. Falconer made no response to this request. But the spirit-stand was\nin the sideboard, and when his mother was gone Melville helped himself\nto a pretty strong dram, and then lounged about till it was time to\nmount the \"four-wheel\" and drive into Wells.",

Come in Aunt Letitia, here is\nJoyce.\"\nMiss Falconer was in the parlour on the right-hand side of the little,\nlow-roofed lobby, and rose somewhat feebly from her chair by the wide\ngrate, which was gay with pots of flowers and evergreens.\n\"Well, my child, welcome. Have you come to Wells with your father?\"\n\"Yes, auntie; and I am come here for dinner, and after dinner may\nCharlotte come and do some shopping with me? I have a long list of\ncommissions at the china shop and at Wilmott's.\"\n\"Charlotte will be pleased to accompany you, dear child; and when you\nhave taken off your bonnet, come and tell me home news.\"\nThere were not many stairs to ascend to Charlotte's bedroom, which\nlooked into the gardens at the back of two other houses of some\npretension, between the Vicar's Close and the Deanery.\nCharlotte curled herself up in the deep window-seat, and watched her\ncousin as she laid aside her large bonnet, smoothed her hair, and\narranged her white pelerine over her pelisse. Charlotte had a genuine,\nif rather romantic, admiration for her cousin Joyce. Though a good girl,\nshe was somewhat given to sentiment and languishing, complained of being\nfatigued, of headaches, and low spirits. She fed upon romance and\npoetry--the poetry of albums and keepsakes, which was then\nfashionable. Of course she had a hero who figured in her day-dreams; and\nshe would spend hours at the little window of the sitting-room to catch\na sight of him as he passed along the Close. Charlotte would have been\nmuch better for some active employment; but Miss Falconer was getting\nold and feeble in health, and if Charlotte was obedient and gentle, she\nwas well satisfied. So she worked covers in cross-stitch for the chairs,\nknitted her own stockings, read all the light literature which came in\nher way, and played on the cabinet piano which stood against the wall in\nthe sitting-room, with its crimson silk front gathered into the centre\nby a large rosette, and displaying, when open, a very narrow keyboard\nwith very yellow keys.\n[Illustration: The Vicar's Close, Wells.]\n\"How sweetly pretty you look to-day, Joyce. I can't help saying so.\nDon't be angry. I want to read you some verses I have written, called,\n'The Drooping Rosebud.'\" And Charlotte took out of her pocket the\ncrumpled page of a copy-book.\n\"You had better not read it now, Charlotte; Aunt Letitia will expect us\nto go downstairs.\"\n\"Only the first verse,\" Charlotte said, and then she began:\n\"'She bent her head in sorrow,\nThe pretty fragile rose;\nShe languished for the morrow,\nWhere light and gladness grows\nShe languished for a rain drop\nTo cheer her thirsty heart:\nShe was so sad and weary;\nIn joy she had no part.\n'As the raindrop to the rosebud,\nSo is his smile to me;\nAs----'\"\nHere Charlotte stopped and blushed. \"You know who I mean by the rosebud,\nand who the raindrop is?\"\nJoyce laughed merrily.\n\"Oh, Charlotte, you must not come to me for sympathy. I can't understand\nsuch sentiment. You have never spoken to Mr. Bamfylde in your life.\"\n\"_Not spoken_; no, but there is such a thing as the language of eyes.\nJoyce, you don't understand.\"\n\"No, I don't; and I think, Charlotte, it is nonsense to waste your\nthoughts on Mr. Bamfylde, who probably has never given you a thought in\nhis life.\"\n\"I am not so sure about _thoughts_, dear. However, I see you don't care\nabout it, or my verses, or me.\"\n\"Come, Charlotte, don't be silly! Of course I care about you, but I\ndon't think I am poetical or romantic. Indeed, we ought to go\ndownstairs.\"\n\"You must go first, and I will follow,\" said poor Charlotte, putting\n\"The Drooping Rosebud\" in her pocket again, with a sigh; and Joyce\ntripped downstairs alone.\n\"Well, my little rustic,\" Miss Falconer said; \"come and sit down by me,\nand tell me the news.\"\n\"Melville came home last week,\" Joyce said. \"He is determined to travel,\nand father did so want him to settle down at home and help him with the\nestate. But, oh! Aunt Lettice, nothing will ever make him into a farmer.\nHe is dressed to-day, to come into Wells, like a fine gentleman. I get\nso angry with Melville, Aunt Lettice.\"\n\"He will come round in time, my dear. Young men are often a little\ndifficult to manage, and then sober down so wonderfully.\"\n\"But Melville is twenty-three, nearly twenty-four, Aunt Lettice. Father\nhas given him every advantage, and all he wished for, and now he says he\ncannot possibly live a country gentleman's life.\"\n\"Oxford was a poor preparation for that life, I must own,\" said Miss\nFalconer; \"only it was natural perhaps, that your father should yield\nto your mother's wishes.\"\n\"Mother suffers the most,\" said Joyce hotly, \"far, far the most. It\nmakes me so angry when I think of the way mother is treated.\"\n\"My dear child, she has spoiled Melville, and this is the result.\"\n\"It would not be the result if Melville had an atom of gentleman-like\nfeeling. Looking down on mother, who----\" Joyce's voice faltered.\n\"It was unfortunate that your father married below him in the social\nscale; he was caught in the rebound, as we say. But all that is over and\ndone with: still, we may deplore it; though no one can respect your dear\nmother more than I do. Marriage,\" said Miss Falconer, slowly and\ndeliberately, \"has not been successful in our family. Charlotte's\nmother, our only sister, made a very unwise marriage, and her only child\nhas been thrown upon me to support. Not that I regret it. Charlotte is\nan amiable, gentle girl, and a companion to me. I have given her such\nadvantages as I could afford, and she is fairly accomplished. I had a\nvisitor yesterday I little expected, at her very advanced age. Mrs.\nHannah More paid her first call on our new Bishop, and was so obliging\nas to come on here. She was speaking of you with interest, my dear.\"\n\"Of me!\" exclaimed Joyce. \"What does she know of me?\"\n\"She knows about most people in the county; and, naturally, your\nmother's opposition to Mrs. More's views has reached her. She forbade a\ndairy-maid to read, who had once been in Mrs. More's school, and when\nshe disobeyed her, dismissed her on the spot. It was much to be\nregretted. Greatly as I respect your mother, I must confess this act\nannoyed me.\"\n\"Did Mrs. More mention it yesterday, Aunt Lettice?\"\n\"Yes; and she said she would like to have some communication with you.\nShe had seen you riding with your father, and was taken by your looks.\nShe inquired what education you had, and was shocked when I told her\nabsolutely none. I told her I had implored your father to send you to a\nboarding-school at Clifton, but that he was obstinate. For, with all his",

The market-place at Wells is not without its\npicturesque features; old gabled houses skirt the north side and part of\nthe south side, while a cross stands at the bottom of the square. Clear\nwater, from one of the many springs, which first attracted the College\nof Priests, in the time of Alfred's son Edward, to found their religious\nhouse in Wells, makes soft music as it runs down the streets in crystal\nstreams. Two quaint archways, or, as they were in old documents called,\nthe Palace Eye and the Deanery Eye, stand at the head of the\nmarket-square, and between them are two ancient houses, one of which was\nbuilt by Bishop Beckington, and has rooms over the porch, or gateway,\nthrough which foot-passengers pass into the Cathedral Green.\nThere is a delightful sense that life flows easily and peacefully at\nWells by the appearance of its citizens. The master of the large shop\nwhere the two girls stopped, was standing complacently at the door, his\nhands in his pockets, calmly surveying the rush of the cathedral\nchoristers across the square, for the first chime had sounded for\nafternoon service.\nJoyce was known as Squire Falconer's daughter at Fair Acres, and treated\nwith respect. She was conducted to a counter at the end of the dark, low\nshop, where the head shopwoman waited on her. Joyce's list of\ncommissions was for the most part of the homely and useful kind; but\nCharlotte was attracted by a display of gauze ribbons, then greatly\nin fashion, for the large loops worn on the crown of gipsy bonnets. She\nwas not proof against buying two yards of straw-coloured ribbon with a\nblue edge, and when the ring was pulled down the ends of her purse\nagain, it slipped off, for there was nothing left in it.\n[Illustration: The Market Place, Wells.]\n\"Look, Joyce, what lovely ribbon! Do get some, Joyce.\"\nBut Joyce was intently examining some homely towelling, and weighing the\nrespective merits of bird's-eye and huckaback.\n\"I don't want any ribbons,\" she said. \"Yes, it is pretty, but what are\nyou going to do with it?\" Then turning to the counter: \"I want a box of\nneedles--all sizes, and half-a-dozen reels of cotton, and----\"\n\"Joyce, I think I will go to the door while you are finishing all these\ndull things; and then----\"\nJoyce glanced at the large clock over the counter:\n\"Then, I think, we will go to the service, and if we are not too\nlate----\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" Charlotte said, eagerly. \"Do let us go, and come back to the\nchina-shop afterwards.\"\nCharlotte had her own reasons for desiring to go to the cathedral. The\nhero of her silent worship was Mr. Bamfylde, a new minor Canon, and it\nwas his week for doing the duty.\nJoyce completed her purchases, and left orders for them to be sent to\nthe Swan; and then, just as the last chime was ringing and the old clock\nstruck three, the two girls passed up the nave to the choir.",

A wooded height, known as Tor\nHill, rises nearer to the Palace, and then the line sweeps round to the\nMendip range, which shuts in Wells on the north-east, and across which a\nlong, straight road lies in the direction of Bristol.\nThe bishop continued to chat pleasantly as he led his visitors along the\nbroad terrace walk on the top of the battlemented wall. Then he passed\ndown into the garden, and ascended a spiral stone staircase which led to\na small ante-chamber, and then into the long gallery.\nThis room is one of the principal features of the Palace at Wells, with\nits long line of small, deep bay windows, and its beautiful groined\nroof, the walls covered with portraits of many bishops who have held the\nsee.\nArchbishop Laud looks down with a somewhat grim face, like a man who had\nset himself to endure hardness, and never flinch from the line he had\nmarked out for himself. Saintly Ken, too, is there, and keen,\nthin-lipped Wolsey, who had not learned when he sat for that picture the\nbitter lesson which his old age brought him, not to put his trust in\nprinces, or in any child of man.\nThe war-like bishop, too, with the hole in his cheek, had, a very\nunwarlike expression.\n\"A jolly old fellow!\" Mr. Arundel remarked; \"not like a man who cared to\nhandle a musket or bayonet.\"\n\"No; appearances are deceitful at times,\" the bishop said. \"The stairs\nup which we came, open into my study, from that little ante-chamber; and\nI confess I should take flight by them and get into the chapel if by\nchance the Palace is besieged.\"\n\"Not much fear of that,\" Melville said, \"in these days.\"\n\"These days are not as quiet as they may look, young sir.

But nothing could destroy the symmetry of the arm and hand,\nwhich was stretched out towards the swans with a bit of bread.

I\nhave ordered our carriage; you ought to come to the end of the Moat,\nthere is a fine view of Dulcot.\"\nBut Mr. Arundel showed no intention of following his friend. \"Nay,\" he\nsaid, \"let me see the swans have the last bit of bun. See, they are\ncoming for it. Do you always bring them buns?\"\n\"Not always; but I had a convenient halfpenny left from the change at\nWillmott's, so I went to buy a stale bun at the little shop in Saddler\nStreet.\"\n\"Happy swans to be so remembered!\" Mr. Arundel said, as he watched the\nlast wedge of the stale bun gobbled up by the master of the brood, while\nhis wife gave him a savage peck with her black bill.\n\"It is a pity they are so greedy; it spoils their beauty,\" Joyce said.\nThen, with sudden recollection, she said, \"Oh! Charlotte, I have\nforgotten to take Piers' sparrow-hawk to Mr. Plume's. I must go at once\nto Aunt Letitia's and fetch it. I left it in the basket there.\"\n\"Can I go and fetch the sparrow-hawk, Miss Falconer?\" Mr. Arundel began.\n\"Come, Arundel,\" Melville interrupted, \"you and I can stroll round this\nmoat; we are not returning, as I told you, with Joyce.\"\nBut Mr. Arundel deliberately turned in the direction in which Joyce was\nhastening; and Charlotte, much to her cousin's vexation, was left with\nhim.\nA muttered exclamation, which was not fit for ears polite to hear,\nescaped Melville's lips, and Charlotte's soft speeches were lost on\nhim.",

A large fox, with gleaming\nteeth and glassy eyes, stared at the customers from a shelf in a recess\nby the fire-place. A badger was on another; and owls of all sizes and\ncolours were standing, with one foot tucked up, and a certain stony\nstare in their great round, unshadowed eyes.\nMr. Plume did not waste words.\n\"Sparry-'awk,\" he said \"sparry-'awk; it is of not great value, missie.\nHumph!\" he continued, \"it's not a rare speciment, but I'll set it up.\nHow's the young gentleman, eh?\"\n\"Quite well, thank you, Mr. Plume; and please have the bird ready by the\nnext time we come into Wells. We must not stop now; but what a noise\nthose men are making.\"\nAs she spoke, Mr. Arundel went out to the door, and Joyce, peeping\nthrough the cases in the window, saw a cart being dragged up the hill\ntowards the Bristol Road by four rough-looking men. Another huge man sat\nin the cart, his head lolling upon his breast, evidently the worse for\ndrink. A few wild-looking men and boys and a lean pony followed; and two\nor three women, with their hair hanging down their backs, brought up the\nrear; and all were shouting at the top of their voices some rhyme, the\ndrift of which was, that the justices had got the worst of it, and that\nBob was free.\n\"What does it all mean?\" Mr. Arundel said.\n\"Oh, it's only some of the rough Mendip folk. One of 'em was taken up\nfor snaring rabbits, and there was a great row. I suppose the justices\nhave let him off--afraid to do anything else. There is a deal of\nill-blood in them parts; and they say it's even worse in the cities than\nwhat it is in the country. Dear me!\" said Mr. Plume, stroking the back\nof a stuffed spaniel which was handy. \"It's a thousand pities folks\ncan't mind their own business, instead of annoying respectable folks.\nGood-day to you, Miss Falconer.

Who said so?\"\n\"Melville, of course. He said you would be shocked to rumble and jolt\nover the roads, and that your luggage must go on the roof of the\npost-chaise.\"\nMr. Arundel laughed a merry, pleasant laugh, and said:\n\"I am sorry your brother should have given you such a bad account of me.\nPoor fellow!\"\nJoyce looked up quickly.\n\"Then you don't think exactly as Melville does?\"\n\"No, I hope not,\" was the reply.\n\"But he is a friend of yours, is not he?\"\n\"Yes, he is a friend--up to a certain point. Do not think me\nungracious.\"\n\"Oh! no. I understand.\"\n\"Melville thinks a great deal of you, and is so proud that you have come\nhere. I am glad you have come also, now I have seen you, though when I\nfirst heard you were coming I dreaded it; and so did mother. But I must\nnot stop to talk any more now, except to ask you to make mother feel as\nyou have made me feel, that you are not so very grand, after all.\"\nThe squire was seen at the door of the Crown as Joyce and Mr. Arundel\nturned into Saddler Street, and Joyce ran quickly towards him. Her\nfather waved his hand impatiently.\n[Illustration: S. Cuthbert's, Wells.]\n\"Come, Joyce; come, make haste!\"\nIn another moment she had mounted to her seat by his side, and they were\noff at a quick trot. The good old horse knew that her head was turned\nhomewards and went cheerily down the High Street, past the noble\nchurch of St. Cuthbert, where there was no traffic to impede its\nprogress.\nThe squire was silent until they were fairly out of the town, when he\nsaid:\n\"So your grand brother can't ride in his father's carriage! He and his\nfine friend may pay for the chaise; I shall not.\"\n\"I do not think the friend is fine after all,\" Joyce said; \"he laughed\nat the idea of the post-chaise.\"\nThe squire cracked his whip impatiently.\n\"He may well laugh. Ah! little Joyce, there are many graver questions at\nissue than the freaks of an over-indulged, reckless boy like Melville.\nWe had a stormy scene in the court to-day. That man who was let off a\nmonth, in gaol richly deserved punishment; but there was a division on\nthe bench and my conviction was overruled.\"\n\"Oh!\" Joyce exclaimed, \"I saw a crowd of rough people going up the\nBristol Road; they had taken a pony out of a cart, and were dragging it\nup the hill, with a man in it, who was half asleep.\"\n\"Half drunk,\" said the squire; \"that is more likely. They are a rough\nlot on Mendip, more like savages than the inhabitants of a civilised\ncountry.\"\n\"What is to be done to make them better, father? Has not Mrs. More tried\nto get the children taught?\"\n\"Yes, she has been trying for years to make the schools succeed; but\nthere is plenty of labour and little to show for it.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" said Joyce, \"there is some good done, though we don't see it.\nIt is always easier to see bad things than good ones; so easy to see\nfaults in those about us, and to be blind to their goodness.\"\nThe squire laughed; between this father and daughter there existed a\nsympathetic friendship wholly independent of the natural tie of parent\nand child.\n\"You are right, Joyce, quite right; but I am afraid one does not need\nglasses to find out the bad things.\"\n\"Father, let us put them on to find the good ones, then,\" Joyce\nrejoined.\nThe squire leaned back, and let the old horse go her own pace, and her\nown way.\n\"Ah! my little Joyce, that is wise advice. Thank God, I need no\nspectacles to find out the good in _you_. I look to you to keep things\nsmooth at home for the next few days, and to help me to do the same. I\nam quick-tempered, I know, and when I flare out, I am sorry afterwards.\"\n\"You don't often 'flare out,' as you say, to _me_, dear dad.\"\n\"What did your aunt say to you to-day?--called you her 'rustic,' I'll\nanswer for it.\"\n\"Oh, yes, of course she did; and she wants me to pay a grand visit to\nBarley Wood.\"\n\"To Barley Wood!--to Mrs. Hannah More! Mother won't hear of it. Your\naunt had better not meddle. What do you think about it yourself?\"\n\"I should like to pay a visit--a _short_ visit--to Barley Wood. That is\nquite different from going to school. But with the boys coming home, and\nMelville and his friend at Fair Acres, I doubt if I could be spared. It\nmight do me good to go, father; I mean, make me all the more useful at\nhome afterwards.\"\n\"What do you expect Mrs. Hannah More to do to you?--cut you into a\npattern, as she would cut an old woman's cloak, eh? However, if you wish\nto go, and any more is said, I'll manage it for you. Perhaps no more\n_will_ be said; your aunt is just as likely to forget all about it.\"\n\"Yes, I know that,\" Joyce said, with a little ring of disappointment in\nher voice.\n\"I'll tell you what pattern I would not have you cut into on any\naccount; and that is poor die-away, languishing Charlotte Benson. Poor\nthing! if she is a specimen of boarding-schools and accomplishments, I\nwould sooner have Jane Watson for a daughter.\"\n\"Charlotte paints flowers very well, father,\" Joyce said; \"and she has\nworked a figure in Berlin wool of a woman in a red gown feeding\nchickens; and----\"\nThey had been jogging along at a very leisurely pace, and the sound of\nfast-trotting horses made Joyce look back.\n\"To the right, father! quick! it's the post-chaise from the Swan.\"\nThe squire pulled up towards the high hedge, and the post-chaise dashed\npast, the luggage behind, and the two young men lying back in it. The\ngates of Fair Acres were in sight, and the carriage turned in with an\nimposing flourish of the post-boy's whip.\n\"Look here, Joyce, that is a sign of the times. That poor foolish\npopinjay of ours is only drifting on with the tide. He has brought\nanother young fellow, I daresay, as idle as himself, to eat my bread and\ngive himself airs. Well, I will put up with it for a week, and then\n_both_ have notice to quit; nor do I desire to see either of them darken",

She won't get out of the carriage, because her legs are\ntoo stiff.\"\n\"Come, my dear,\" the squire said, \"make haste, and go round to the front\ndoor.\"\n\"Not I. I shall not make haste; indeed, I'll send Joyce instead. Go,\nJoyce, at once. Say we are having a hay-making party, and end with a\nsupper when the last wain is carried; which, I'll be bound, she will\ncall sinful.\"\nJoyce had to free herself from the wisps of hay which clung to her, and\nto smooth her tangled curls. They were confined by combs and pins, but\nall had fallen out in the scrimmage in the hay, and they now fell on\neither side of her flushed face. Perhaps she had never looked more\nlovely than at that moment when, turning to her father, she said:\n\"Do you really wish me to go like this, dear dad?\"\n\"My dear, some one must go; and at once. Mrs. More is not a person to\nkeep waiting.\"\nJoyce did not delay a moment, but went with her quick, light step across\nthe field, and then through a little gate which opened into a belt of\nlow-growing shrubs, beyond which was the carriage-road from the village.\nAn old-fashioned _barouche_--old-fashioned even in those days--stood\nbefore the door, and sitting in it were two ladies; the elder one\nupright and alert, the younger leaning back as if to resign herself to\nthe long waiting time, before any of the family appeared.\nAlthough comparatively near neighbours in the county, Joyce never\nremembered to have seen Mrs. More before. Her name was familiar enough,\nand her schools, established on all sides, were known by every one,\nthough it cannot be said they were approved by every one.\nMrs. More and her sister had in times past made some overtures towards\nMrs. Falconer, but they were coldly repulsed, and a parcel of tracts had\neven been returned. Later there had been the disagreement about the\ndairy-maid, and the time for Mrs. Hannah More to carry the crusade into\nthe enemy's camp was over. She had, in the year 1824, nearly numbered\nher four-score years; and the loss of her sisters, and repeated attacks\nof illness, made her more willing to rest from her labours, only taking\ncare that the good seed sown in the days of health and vigour, should be\nwatered and cared for, that it might yield a good harvest.\nIt had happened that several times during the lovely spring of this year\nshe had met Joyce Falconer driving in the high gig with her father, or\ntrotting by his side on the rough pony, the use of which she shared with\nall her young brothers. The sweet, frank face had attracted her, and she\nhad inquired about Joyce when on a visit of ceremony at the Palace at\nWells a few weeks before.\nThe result was, as we know, that Miss Falconer gave a melancholy account\nof her niece's ignorance, which she believed was entirely due to her\nmother's prejudices as to boarding-schools and her father's\nover-indulgence and excessive affection for his only daughter.\nWith her accustomed sympathy with all the young who were just setting\nforth on life's journey, Mrs. More determined to see something of Mr.\nFalconer's little daughter, and her aunt's letter had decided her to\nlose no time in paying a visit to Fair Acres.\nAs Joyce came up to the steps of the carriage Mrs. More held out her\nhand--a white, delicately-formed hand, half covered by a lace mitten.\nJoyce had heard Mrs. More spoken of as an old lady of near eighty, and\nher surprise was written on her lovely face, as she said, simply:\n\"Are you Mrs. More?\"\nFor the beautiful dark eyes were still lustrous, and the lips, parted\nwith a smile, displayed a row of even teeth which many a young woman in\nthese days might envy. A quantity of white hair was turned back from a\nround, full forehead, which was shadowed by a drawn-silk riding-hood,\nwith a deep curtain and a wide bow under the chin. Intellect and\nbenevolence shone on the face, which was marked by few lines, and the\nstill young spirit lighted up the whole countenance as Mrs. More said:\n\"Yes, I am Mrs. More; and I have come to pay my respects to your good\nfather and mother, and to make your acquaintance.\"",

Fair Acres did not have the services of one clergyman,\nbut shared the ministrations of the vicar, with another small parish.\nThe cracked bell began to ring in a querulous, uncertain fashion on\nSunday morning, and punctually at half-past ten Mrs. Falconer marshalled\nher flock down the road to the church.\nThe church, though small, was architecturally a fine specimen of Early\nEnglish, and raised a noble tower to the sky; but the interior was\ndilapidated, and the pillars were covered with many coats of yellow\nwash, and the pews were hung with moth-eaten cloth. The squire's pew was\nlike a square room, with a fire-place and cushioned seats, and a high\ndesk for the books ran round it.\nMrs. Falconer and her husband sat facing each other on either side of\nthe door of the pew, and the boys were ranged round, while at the\nfurther end Joyce sat with Mr. Arundel, a place being left for Melville.\nJust as the clergyman had hurried on his very crumpled surplice, and the\nband in the gallery struck up the familiar air to which the morning hymn\nwas sung, Melville, dressed in his best, came up the uneven pavement of\nthe aisle with the proud consciousness of superiority to the rest of the\nworld. His father threw back the door, and he passed up to the further\nend of the seat, nodding carelessly to Mr. Arundel, who made no sign in\nreturn. Chatting and making engagements for the week was at this time\nvery common in church. There was scant reverence shown for the house of\nGod. He was a God afar off, and the formal recognition of some sort of\nallegiance to Him being respectable and necessary for the maintenance of\nsocial position, brought people like Mrs. Falconer to church Sunday\nafter Sunday.\nMrs. Falconer and the squire, with their family, were never absent from\ntheir places, and Mr. Watson, the squire's agent, acting as sidesman,\nwas also regular in his attendance.\nBut it was a lifeless mechanical service on the part of both minister\nand people; and the loud Amens of the old clerk were the only responses\nto be heard. The Psalms at the end of the book of Common Prayer were\nused, accompanied by a strangely-assorted band in the worm-eaten\ngallery, and two or three men and boys supplemented the scraping of the\nfiddle and bassoon with singing, which might well be called bawling.\nNor was Fair Acres an isolated instance of country parish churches; and\ncity churches, too, at this date. The great tide of the evangelical\nmovement had, it is true, set steadily in, and was soon to cover the\nkingdom with its healing and reviving waters; but its streams did not\npenetrate into the heart of the hills, and small outlying villages went\non, with no schools and no resident clergymen, and were contented\nbecause they were asleep.\nOf course the sound of \"the waters of Siloah\" were heard in\nSomersetshire as, one by one, Hannah More's schools grew and flourished,\nand, one by one, her enemies became her friends. But the apathy at Fair\nAcres on the part of the clergyman, and the determination of Mrs.\nFalconer to set her face like a flint against all innovations, was\nthought to be praiseworthy, and to show a laudable desire to resist",

Superficial and foolish\nhimself, he was almost unable to appreciate the earnest sincerity of his\nfriend, and on this particular Sunday his temper had been tried by the\narrival of a letter from the Palace at Wells, brought over on the\nprevious evening by a special messenger, in which the Lord Bishop of\nBath and Wells requested the pleasure of Mr. Arundel's company at dinner\non the following Monday, but made no mention of him.

Besides,\nthe boys' best Sunday jackets and long tight trousers were in peril, if\ntheir usual habits of tree-climbing and birds' egg hunting were not laid\naside with their week-day garments.\nThe large Sunday dinner at one o'clock was always lengthened out to its\nutmost limit, but when that was over, the time hung heavy on hand.\nA smart box on Bunny's ear, administered by Melville, with a hand on\nwhich a huge ring glistened, and which left a pretty deep triangular cut\non the boy's ear, roused Piers' indignation.\n\"You coward,\" he said; \"just because he trod on your smart shoe. I would\nnot wear such a shoe for a hundred pounds.\"\n\"You are not very likely to be tried,\" was Melville's rejoinder. \"Your\nfeet are not made for shoes with buckles.\"\n\"Oh! Melville,\" Joyce exclaimed, \"how can you be so unkind?\" while his\nfather said, in a stern voice, \"If you have no brains, sir, I always\nthought you had a heart.\"\nMrs. Falconer was rising to follow Bunny, whose loud crying was heard in\nthe hall; but Joyce said:\n\"Mother, let me go. I had better take all the boys away, mother, and\namuse them, if I can. I don't think Bunny need cry like that, though it\nwas too bad to hit him.\"\n\"It was indeed,\" Gilbert Arundel could not help exclaiming fervently,\nthough like all guests in a house, when family disputes are going on, he\nfelt it difficult to know whether to speak or be silent.\n\"I hate Melville,\" Piers said fiercely, as he swung himself out of the\nroom after his sister.",

The\nsweet earnestness of the face which he had been watching while she\nspoke, the entire absence of self-consciousness, seemed to lift her\nabove the level of compliments or flattery, which the gentlemen of the\ntime considered the rightful inheritance of the young ladies, with whom\nthey trifled for an hour's amusement.\nAs she sat with her face towards the beautiful landscape over which the\nwestering sun was casting its level rays, she seemed so far above him\nand bearing the \"lily in her hand\" of which a poet of later days than\nthose in which Joyce lived has said that--\n\"Gates of brass cannot withstand\nOne touch of that enchanted wand.\"\nThe silence which fell over Gilbert was unbroken for a few minutes by\nany word on either side. At last Joyce said:\n\"Is there anything I can do for Melville? He has rather a way of looking\ndown on me, and I think I speak crossly to him sometimes. I wish you\nwould tell me if you think I could help father about him.\"\n\"If he does not listen to _you_ I should think it hopeless that he would\nlisten to anyone,\" Gilbert said; \"he has a way of looking down on most\npeople.\"\n\"Not on _you_?\" Joyce said, with a little innocent laugh. \"He made us\nthink you were very grand and that we must alter all our ways to suit\nyou; poor mother was to change the hours for meals, and----\"\n\"I never heard such nonsense,\" Gilbert said; \"but I know where he got\nthose notions from, and I may tell you this much, that the kindest thing\nyou can do is to ask your father, to consent to his going abroad for a\nyear as soon as may be; he will be out of harm's way. I have had some\nfears that the person who had such an evil influence over him might\nfollow him here, and I was determined to circumvent him.\"\n\"It was very kind of you to take this trouble. Who is the person?\"\n\"He is a step-uncle of mine; my mother's half-brother, Lord Maythorne.\"\n\"Quite a grand person, then?\" Joyce said.\n\"Grand in his own eyes; yes, undoubtedly; but there is every hope that,\nhaving got what he can out of Melville, he will leave him alone. You do\nnot know how ashamed I am to own him as a relation; and I am anxious to\ndo all I can to atone for the mischief he may have done your brother.\"\n\"Was he at Oxford with Melville?\"\n\"No: but, unhappily, he has a small place near Oxford, and was\ncontinually coming in.\"\n\"Shall I tell father all about what you have told me?\"\n\"I have told him already a good deal. What I want you to do is to use\nevery effort to persuade your father to let Melville start soon.\"\n\"It would be far better if I could persuade Melville to stay here, and\nlearn about farming.\"\n\"Yes; but that, I am afraid, you will never do; and considering that\nyour father wished him to work on the estate it was a mistake to send\nhim to Oxford at all.\"\n\"Oh, yes; but it was mother's wish, you know,\" Joyce said, with a\nheightened colour. \"Mother always feels that her family was not\nconsidered as good as father's; they were simple, homely, good people,\nbut not what are called gentry, and I think it has always been mother's\ndesire that Melville should have exactly the same advantages as the sons\nof our neighbours. Charlie Paget went to Oxford; they live at Ebbor\nCourt; and so it seemed her eldest son ought to go. It is so strange\nthat mother should be quite consistent on every subject but one, and\nthat one, the indulgence of Melville; and now I believe he will break\nher heart.\"\n\"No, no, I trust not so bad as that,\" Mr. Arundel said. \"I have hopes\nthat there will be a change for the better, and all this folly and aping\nhis betters will drop off like an old cloak one day.\"\nJoyce sighed.\n\"I wish I could have hopes too; there is always, I suppose, some cloud\nin everyone's sky; and we are so happy, that if it were not for\nMelville, we should have all we wished for. Yesterday in the hay-field I\nfelt as if even to be alive was delicious, everything was so bright and\njoyful. Then Mrs. Hannah More came and invited me to Barley Wood. Have\nyou heard of Mrs. More?\"\n\"Yes, I think I have. A very good old lady, who has set up schools for\nthe poor children. My mother knows all about her. Will you like going to\nBarley Hill?\"\n\"Barley Wood,\" Joyce corrected. \"Yes, I think I shall. Charlotte is to\ncome also; and I dare say I shall like it when I am there, and it may do\nme good.

Of\ncourse I _am_, but I do not know that it is of such great consequence as\nAunt Letitia thinks.\"\n\"It would be a pity, indeed, if you were anything but what you are,\"\nGilbert said earnestly. \"A change could hardly be an improvement.\"\n\"Oh, do not say that,\" Joyce said. \"I want to _know_ more, and though I\nread everything I can in father's library, I do not get any new books.\nRalph helps me with Latin, and Piers and I learn French together, though\nI expect our pronunciation would make you laugh. We have just read\nMadame de Stael's 'Corinne' and a story called 'Matilde,' which\nCharlotte lent me. Is not Piers wonderful?\" she asked; \"he is so happy,\nand have you seen his collection of moths and butterflies? You must come\ninto his room and see them.\"\n\"Yes, I should like to do so very much, if you will be showwoman.\"\nHe liked to hear her talk of her simple home pleasures and interests; he\nliked to watch the ever-changing expression of her lovely face; he felt\nwithin himself that this hour on the hill-side, was to remain a bright\nmemory with him for many a day, to which he would recur with pleasure,\nand over which no cloud could come.",

From the time of Piers' accident Joyce had constituted herself\nhis helper and friend. Mrs. Falconer in her busy life could not devote\nherself to her crippled boy, as mothers of a less energetic and active\nnature might have done.\nJoyce and she had it is true one aim in common: to hide from the father\nthe sad consequences of that one rash act which had shut Piers out for\never from the free, joyous life of his young vigorous brothers. Mrs.\nFalconer did this by apparently making light of her boy's ailments, and\ninability to do what others did.\nIt was a good thing, she would say, that he could not climb trees and\ntear his clothes, or get into the stream by Wookey and ruin his boots\nand socks, or make her anxious by carrying a gun behind his father, in\nthe time of rabbit and rook shooting.\nMrs. Falconer never betrayed what was indeed the truth, that the sound\nof Piers' crutches as they tapped across the old stone pavement of the\nhall, sent a thrill of sorrow through her breast, and that when Piers\nwas laid up, as was not unfrequently the case, with an attack of pain in\nthe hip which had been so severely injured, she avoided being much with\nhim, and left him to Joyce, because the sight of his suffering brought\nback the memory of that morning when she saw him clinging with a\nfrightened face to Rioter's back, and heard her husband say, \"Don't make\na coward of the boy: his brothers rode long before his age.\"\nShe knew too well how bitter had been her husband's self-reproaches,\nand she dreaded adding to them by any impulsive, unguarded word of her\nown.\nThus it was that Joyce was sister, mother, and friend to her lame\nbrother. Their lives were bound up together, and the bond strengthened\nas time went on.\nIt was sufficient reward for Joyce to know that, however irritable when\nin pain, or depressed sometimes by a sudden reminder of his helplessness\nwhen contrasted with his brother's independence and vigour, she could\nalways be sufficient to charm away the cloud by her own sunny\nbrightness, and that by making his interests hers, she never let him\nthink she did anything for him, which was not a real pleasure to\nherself.\nThe secret of heart service lies in this, that those who are served\nnever know it to its full extent, and that any effort that may be made,\nor any trouble that may be taken, is so hidden under the mantle of\nall-pervading love that it is often wholly unsuspected.

A man who has been accustomed to yield\nrespect and courtesy to his own mother, seldom fails in yielding it to\nthe mothers of his friends.\nIf anyone in the household at Fair Acres was dissatisfied it was\nMelville himself, who found that his friend had been so entirely taken\npossession of by his brothers and sister, and was held in such high\nesteem by his father and mother, that his own light was effectually put\nout.\nThe twins, Harry and Bunny, came to him about fly-fishing, and Ralph\nconsulted him as to a difficult passage in his Homer; while he spent a\nwhole morning in helping Piers to re-arrange his moths and butterflies,\nand to look out their names with greater precision in a book he had\nactually borrowed from the Palace at Wells, for this purpose.\nAll the time Joyce went about her accustomed duties: darned Melville's\nsocks, mended the schoolboys' clothes, and was every morning assisting\nher mother in her household duties.\nIt was an added charm in Gilbert's eyes that Joyce made no difference in\nher daily routine, and that what are familiarly called \"company manners\"\nwere apparently unknown at Fair Acres.\nBut the last day came of Gilbert Arundel's visit, as the last must come",

What was the use of\ntrying to reclaim those who preferred their own rough and evil ways?\nThey ought to be well punished for raids made on farm yards, and snares\nset in copses and plantations; but to teach them to read, and talk to\nthem about their duty to God and their neighbour, was in Mrs. Falconer's\neyes worse than lost labour; it did harm rather than good.\nAnd not only by Mrs. Falconer was this view of the unclothed and\nunwashed masses taken! In our days of widely spread and organised\ncharities, and zeal, sometimes I fear hardly tempered with wisdom, it is\ndifficult to throw ourselves back to the beginning of the century now\ndrawing to its close, when efforts like those of the four sisters of the\nMendips, of whom Hannah was the leading spirit, were met with scoffs and\ndisapproval; or deep compassion, that educated women could be so\nmisguided, as to wish to teach the boys and girls of their district,\nanything but to use their legs and arms in the service of their betters!\nAs I stood by the heavy stone in Wrington churchyard, in the gloom of\nan autumn afternoon, where the names of the four sisters are inscribed,\nI could but think of the gratitude we ought to feel to them for their\nbrave efforts to spread the knowledge of the religion of Christ amongst\nthe poor of those 'rolling hills' and peaceful valleys of\nSomersetshire. It must have been hard for a woman of culture like Hannah\nMore to be met by opposition, and in some cases fierce denunciation;\nharder still to be smiled at by those in high places, as a fanatic and a\nvisionary. But turning from the ugly, weather-worn stone, enclosed in\nhigh rusty railings, to the beautiful church, where what light there was\nyet in the sky, came through the many-coloured window lately erected to\nHannah More's memory, I thought, that as nothing that is good and\nbeautiful, coming from the Fountain of all beauty and all goodness, can\never die, so the light which Hannah More kindled in many humble hearts\nwas still shining in the eternal kingdom, where those that have lived as\nin the presence of the Son of God here, shine as the stars for ever in\ntheir Heavenly Father's realm.\nThat touch of Nature which makes the whole world kin brought the two\ngirls near to each other, as Joyce laid her hand upon Susan's, and said:\n\"I am very sorry for you; I shall not forget you;\" then added, looking\ndown on the prostrate form which Susan had so determinedly kept from\ndoing further mischief:\n\"I am sorry for you, too; it must be hard to want bread--but, but--do\ntry to be good and find work.\"",

Do tell me if\nthat man hurt you.\"\n\"He gave me a good shaking. What a giant he is! I felt as your Nip or\nPip might feel in Duke's clutches if he were angry.\"\n\"What a comfort we had not Charlotte with us, and that the boys had gone\non so far! I hope they will not be very anxious at home.\"\nThey made but slow progress. Joyce's usually swift, elastic steps were\nslow and faltering. She took several wrong paths, and they came once to\na steep dip in the heather, and were within a few inches of one of\nthose rocky pits which are frequent on the face of the level country\nabout Cheddar and the neighbouring district. Indeed Cheddar itself\nbegins with one of these small defiles, when entered from the top of the\nMendip, and the gradually increasing height of the rocks, and the\nwidening of the gorge as the road winds through it, is one of its most\nstriking features.\nJoyce was so wholly unaccustomed to feel tired and unnerved, that she\nsurprised herself, as well as Gilbert, by sitting down helplessly, and\nbursting into tears.\n\"Oh! we should have been killed if we had fallen down there. Won't you\nleave me, and go on to the shepherd's cottage? What can be the matter\nwith me?\" she said, sobbing hysterically.\nGilbert hardly knew whether distress at her condition, or delight in\nhaving her all to himself to comfort, predominated.\n\"Do not be frightened,' he said; we shall get on very well if you will\nlet me carry you.\"\n\"Oh! no, no,\" she said, trying to spring up with her accustomed energy.\n\"I will push on again.\"\nBut although she summoned all her courage, she was obliged to let\nGilbert put his arm round her and support her, and finally she was\nlifted in his strong arms and carried whether she wished it or not.\n\"I shall tire you so dreadfully,\" Joyce whispered.\n\"If you do, it is the sweetest tiredness I ever knew; you know that,\nJoyce.\"\nThen they went on in silence. Gilbert was still suffering from the\ntreatment he had received at Bob Priday's hands, and they made slow\nprogress.\n\"Just raise your head,\" he said, after ten minutes' tramp through the\nnarrow track, which he lost at times through the thick tangle of heath\nand gorse and low-growing bracken. \"Raise your head and tell me if you\ncan see the shepherd's cottage. It is getting very dark.\"\nJoyce did as he told her, but, after straining her eyes for a few\nmoments, she said:\n\"I can't see anything, it is so dark. I don't know where we are. Oh, I\ndon't know!\"\n\"You are safe with me,\" Gilbert said; and then added, fervently: \"I am\nnot afraid for God is with us.\"\nIt was so unusual for Joyce to hear that Name spoken. She did not\nrespond, but let her head fall upon his shoulder again.\nPresently he said:\n\"There is a tiny light now--two lights--they must be in the shepherd's\ncottage. Take heart, my darling. We shall soon be home.\"",

While Piers could only hover round Joyce, who, seated on a bench\nor old-fashioned settle by the side of the wide open hearth, held her\nmother in a tight embrace.\n\"The boys ought never to have left you,\" Piers said. \"How could Mr.\nArundel find the way?\"\n\"Joyce knew it,\" said Bunny. \"Joyce knew it. We have been over that\ntrack several times.\"\n\"Yes,\" echoed Harry, \"several times; only Joyce and Mr. Arundel were\ntalking so much, they never thought where they were going.\"\n\"'All's well that ends well,'\" said the squire. \"She had better go to\nbed, my dear; and this young gentleman looks white enough. You must get\nhim a good hot glass of negus; and I hope supper is ready; but take the\npoor child to bed first.\"\nMrs. Falconer had not said much beyond a few words in Joyce's ear, which\nno one else heard. Her usual vivacity and quick, sharp words seemed to\nhave suddenly failed her.\n\"Yes; I'll take her to bed, and there she will have to lie all\nto-morrow, I expect. It's the last time I'll allow her to separate from\nthe rest of us, when we are out on an excursion.

Clifton was at this\ntime gradually changing its position, or rather enlarging its borders!\nAt the close of the preceding century, or during the latter half of it,\nClifton Spa was the chief attraction. To these healing waters, as we\nknow by Mason's celebrated epitaph, a sorrowing husband brought his\nfading wife. Dowry Square and Dowry Parade, with their little quaint\npillars and balconies were in great request for invalids and visitors,\nfrom their near neighbourhood to the pump room.\nConsumptive patients might be seen slowly walking under the row of trees\nby the banks of the muddy Avon, and gazing across at the deep recesses\nof the Leigh Woods with wistful eyes. To the weak and the ailing\nNightingale Valley was then, though so near, very far off for them, and\nonly the robust and vigorous could cross the river by Rownham Ferry,\nand scale the wooded heights which at all times and in all seasons are\nso fair to look upon.\nBut at the time of which I write the tide of visitors was setting in\n_upwards_. The word \"relaxing\" was coming into fashion, and enterprising\nbuilders had raised, halfway up the hill, Windsor Terrace and the\nParagon, that circular range of houses which, entered from the level\nroad before Prince's Buildings, ends abruptly in a house which may\nindeed be said to \"be built upon a rock,\" the windows looking straight\ndown its precipitous sides.\nAlong the road which I have mentioned, which follows the course of the\nriver, though high above it, was erected 'Prince's Buildings;' the\n'first gentleman in Europe' during his long regency appears to have\nsupplied the names of many streets and terraces in this neighbourhood.\nCoronation Road beneath commemorates the auspicious event when Queen\nCaroline was shut out from her rights, and Prince's Buildings above was\nalso previously named in his honour. Crescents and terraces were quick\nto follow one another on the heights, and the glories of the Hot wells,\nand the salubrity of the waters, became things of the past.\nBracing air began to be the panacea for ailments, and the Clifton Downs,\nnow secured to the citizens of Bristol by the merchant venturers for\never, were sought by many who, a few years before, would have buried\nthemselves and their hopes of recovery under the shadow of the rocky\nheights, instead of facing the keen air upon their summit.\nThere was a medium preserved, however--Prince's Buildings, and the\nhouses built on the slope of Sion Hill, were sheltered at the back and\nfrom the front commanded a view of the Leigh Woods before them, and a\nshoulder of the great St. Vincent Rock to their right, which might well\nexcite the admiration of those who saw it for the first time.\nAfter Gilbert Arundel had stepped less briskly than sometimes up the\nsteep slope of Granby Hill, leaving the Crescent to his right, he passed\nalong the back of Prince's Buildings and up Sion Hill, where his mother\nhad taken up her temporary abode.",

There\nmust have been some great attraction.\"\n[Illustration: St Vincent's Rock, From Leigh Woods.]\nGilbert did not care to have his personal history proclaimed to the\npeople who were seated on benches at the top of the Zig-zag--a path now\ncut in the rock and made easier of ascent by means of flights of steps,\nbut then scarcely more than a bridle path, rough and slippery to the\nfeet.\nThe door was open and Gilbert walked in, and walked upstairs. His mother\nwas on the watch, and came to the head of the stairs to meet him,\nkissing him affectionately.\n\"Well, my dear son, are you pleased with our quarters? But, Gilbert, you\ndo not look well; what is the matter?\"\n\"Nothing; I had a tussle with a Somersetshire miner last evening, and\nfeel as if I had got the worst of it to-day. What a lovely view you have\nfrom the window!\"\nThe young lady who had spoken to him on the balcony now stepped into the\nroom.\n\"Well, Gilbert, Aunt Annabella and I had quite given you up. My dear\ncousin, you look very lugubrious.\"\n\"Do I?\" Gilbert replied. \"A head-ache is a lugubrious thing; and how are\nyou, Gratian?\"\n\"Pretty well. I have been rather out of sorts; but I shall soon recover,\nnow you are come.\"\n\"That is a very pretty speech, Gratian, only I can't quite believe it.\"\n\"Well, I am going to take a walk abroad now, and leave you and your\nmother to have a chat together, all about Fairy Acre, or Fair Acre;\nwhich is it? I am very stupid; pray forgive me. Any commissions in the\nMall or Regent Street, Aunt Bella?\"\nMrs. Arundel, who had been getting her son some refreshment from one of\nthe deep cupboards by the fire place, and was anxious to administer a\nglass of wine, now turned towards her niece. \"No. Are you going alone,\nGratian?\"\n\"Yes, I am starting alone; I don't mean to fall over the rocks.\nGood-bye.\"\nGratian Anson was long past her _premi\u00e8re jeunesse_, and had never been\nactually pretty; but she was one of those women who exercise an\nextraordinary fascination apparently without any effort, and have their\nprey in their net, before there is any suspicion that the net is spread.\nGratian dressed fashionably, and one of her perfections was a tall and\nwell-proportioned figure. We might not, now-a-days, think it was set off\nby her short and full-flounced muslin gown, made with a short waist,\nthe body cut low, while over it she wore an enormous pelerine of muslin,\nedged with lace, which was crossed ever her breast and fastened with a\ncurious antique brooch.\nEven Gratian's tall figure could scarcely bear gracefully the width\nwhich fashion had decreed; and all was surmounted by a hat with a\nsugar-loaf crown, and a deep brim caught up on the left side by a large\nred rosette.\nAs she drew on her long, loose gloves, she surveyed her cousin with an\nappraising, searching glance. Her eyes were at all times too keen, and\nher wide mouth displayed a row of white teeth more fully than was quite\nagreeable.\n\"Ah!\" she said, tapping Gilbert's shoulder; \"ah! he is in love. I have\nno doubt of it! _Adieu; au revoir, cher cousin!_\"",

Afterwards they began to speak of Melville, and all the\npast, in which Gilbert had borne such a noble part.\n\"I have separated him from Maythorne, and at least that is a step in the\nright direction; but he is so weak. How he came to be her brother, I\ncan't imagine; he is crazed on the subject of titles, and will roll off\na list of intimate friends, when he thinks I am not listening, to whom\nhe never spoke ten words in his life. I dined at the palace, and the\nbishop sent you his love, and so did his son, who lives with him--two\ncourteous gentlemen, with well-turned compliments at their tongue's end.\nThe bishop said I was like you, and that I had followed in the lines of\none of the most beautiful women he ever met.\"\n\"What bare-faced flattery!\" Mrs. Arundel said, laughing. \"I never was a\nbeauty. Your good looks come from the other side of the house.\"\n\"Who is flattering now?\" Gilbert asked; \"but seriously, mother, you\nshall accept an invitation to the Wells Palace, you must promise to do\nso. The bishop said something about November, if you did not mind the\nfalling leaves.\"\n\"I shall wait till I am asked,\" Mrs. Arundel said. \"If his lordship has\nburied me in the dust of years--out of sight and out of mind--I don't\nsee why he should unearth me now.\"\n\"And yet you sent your son to call you to mind; now that is unfair,\nmother. You urged me to go to the Palace at Wells, and now you won't\ntake advantage of what is growing out of it. But to go back to Falconer;\na stout, middle-aged gentleman, of small means and weak chest, wants to\ntravel for a year. The bishop suggested Mr. Falconer should give him his\nson to lead about, as he had previously washed several black sheep to a\nvery fair whiteness, paying expenses, but no further remuneration. If\nMelville can be got off under such auspices, it will be a grand step in\nthe right direction. Poor fellow! he has got into his head the absolute\nnecessity of seeing the world, and I, who know him pretty well, think\nthat there would be less danger of mischief if he were allowed to follow\nhis bent, than if he were to be forced to follow the pursuits of a\ncountry life at Fair Acres, which he thinks it grand to despise. He\ntalks with amazing coolness of all he shall do when he _does_ come, and\ntill he has learned a lesson, he would be a frightful nuisance to them\nall. The airs he gives himself to the poor old steward are preposterous;\nbut the worst thing about him is the way he speaks to his mother.\"\n\"What is she like?\"\n\"She is a very good woman, rather priding herself on setting aside all\nconventionality, and bustling about the house, and keeping everyone up\nto their duty but her son! Is it not extraordinary? She has ruined him\nwith stupid indulgence, and yet she is strict enough with the rest--even\nwith----\"\n\"Joyce!\" His mother supplied the word with a smile.\n\"Yes, even with Joyce,\" he rejoined; but starting up, with an\nexclamation of dismay:\n\"Did you know Maythorne was in Clifton, mother?\"\nMrs. Arundel followed the direction of her son's eyes, and there on the\nbroken, uneven slopes which lay before Sion Hill, came Gratian, chatting\ngaily to a man of some six-and-thirty or forty, who answered very well\nto the description a poet gave some years after of \"the dandy despot,\nthe jewelled mass of millinery, oiled and curled, and smelling of musk\nand insolence.\"\n\"I am very sorry he has come to Clifton,\" Mrs. Arundel said quickly. \"I\nsuppose he is at the hotel.\"\n\"Gratian looks satisfied. I hope I shan't get very savage with him,\nmother. When we last parted it was the night when I--but I need not talk\nabout it--he got that weak, foolish boy into his hands, and I helped to\nget him out, so he bears me a grudge.\"\n\"Never mind that, my dear son; and, Gilbert, remember an old watchword:\n'He that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that taketh a city.'\"\n\"I know I do flare out at Maythorne sometimes; but then was there not a\ncause?\"\n\"Ah! Gilbert, there is never a cause or an excuse for wrath indulged;\nindignation against _wrong_ is one thing, rage against the wrong-doer\nanother.\"\nAnd now steps were heard in the hall, and Gratian's laugh. She threw\nopen the door and said in a half-mocking tone:\n\"My Lord Maythorne.\"\nMrs. Arundel advanced to meet her brother, and greeted him kindly, but\nwith no profession of extreme delight.\n\"Well, my dear sister,\" Lord Maythorne said, \"I have taken Clifton _en\nroute_ to Plymouth, and wandering aimlessly on the Downs I met your fair\nvisitor, my kinswoman, Gratian. What a quaint little snuggery you have\ngot, Annabella, upon my word; and Gratian tells me my hopeful nephew is\nhere, looking after his future prospects, eh? A little Methodism mixed\nwith law, eh?\" And Lord Maythorne produced an elegant gold snuff-box,\ntapped the lid, and took a delicate pinch between his forefinger and\nthumb, in the most approved fashion of the time.\n\"Ha! Gilbert, how do? Where is your cub, that you were leading about\nwith such good intentions. Have you brought him to introduce to your\nmother, eh?\" Waiting for no answer, and just touching Gilbert's hand\nwith his finger tips, he went on:\n\"Have you dined, Annabella?\"\n\"Long ago; we keep early hours.\"\n\"Well then, I'll return to my hotel to dine, and Gilbert shall accompany\nme.\"\n\"No thank you,\" Gilbert said, \"I shall sup with my mother, and go early\nto bed.\"\n\"You had better accept the invitation, Gilbert. Our supper will not be\nvery recherch\u00e9,\" Gratian said; \"we do not sit down to a royal feast\nhere, we live above such vanities.\"\n\"I dare say he will not be fastidious after his farmhouse life,\" said\nLord Maythorne, scornfully. \"How was your charge; is he walking without\nleading strings yet?\"\nGilbert bit his lip and struggled for composure; but his mother watched\nhim anxiously. Lord Maythorne's irony was hard for her to bear\nsometimes, and she never knew how Gilbert would take it.\n\"My dear boy, there is a wise proverb which in English sounds a little\nharsh, scarcely courteous; in French it is less abrupt: _'Chargez de vos\naffaires.'_ There are other renderings: 'Don't put your fingers into\nother people's pies.'\"\nPoor Gilbert sprang forward and raising his voice said:\n\"I will not submit to your impertinence. What right have you to treat me\nlike this? I saw you, a man almost double my age--\"\n\"Gently, gently my dear boy, not _double_; nay, nay--\"\n\"I say, I saw you trying to ruin a poor, weak fellow, who, weak as he\nwas, trusted you, and I tried to save him. I wonder you are not ashamed\nto speak thus; you are--\"\nThe fierce torrent of angry words suddenly stopped. His mother laid her\nhand upon his arm, and with a great effort he regained his composure.\n\"I beg your pardon, mother, for brawling here, in your presence, and in\nyours, Gratian, also; it is very unseemly.\"\nA mocking laugh from Lord Maythorne was his only response, and Gratian\nleft the room saying:\n\"Adieu! I hope to find you in a better temper at supper, Gilbert,\" which\nwas scarcely less irritating.\nGilbert followed her, and left his mother and her brother together.",

Handsome, and with gentleman-like\nmanners when it suited him, he was unscrupulous as to truth, and could\nsend the shafts of his satire, dipped in gall, with a smiling face of\nindifference.

His hot temper was governed, and a\ntorrent of angry words was often checked; while he did his best to\ntrample out the dislike it was impossible not to feel for his uncle.\nWhen Mrs. Arundel was left alone with her brother, he threw himself\ncarelessly on a sofa, and again drew out his snuff-box.\n\"So you have quite decided on the law for that boy,\" he said.\n\"Yes; this seems a good beginning here, and I have been able to article\nhim to a most respectable firm of solicitors.\"\n\"They are a dirty lot generally; however, I am glad that young fellow is\nreally going to earn his living, and make his own way in the world.

I suppose you do not happen to have a hundred pounds you\ndon't know what to do with?\"\n\"Certainly not; I cannot imagine, Maythorne, how you can think of such a\nthing.\"\n\"Well, I know you send a lot to convert the niggers and Hindoos, and\nthat you subscribe to a society for the flinging about of Bibles, which\nno one reads.\"\n\"Stop, please, Maythorne; I could not listen to any more conversation\nlike this; I will not take part in it. I can lend you no money; but once\nmore, for our father's sake, I cannot help begging, entreating you to\nturn from the ways of sin.\"\n\"No cant, please, Annabella; it makes me savage, and I don't want to\naffront you.\"\n\"I do not care whether you are affronted or not,\" Mrs. Arundel said,\nearnestly. \"I cannot help feeling that we are of the same blood, and\nthat if you were a worthy successor of my father you might be a joy and\nsupport to me. Instead of this, I have to try to keep my son from your\ninfluence, and dread that even by hearing your irreverent way of\ntreating sacred things, he may grow accustomed to what is wrong. Oh! it\nis not too late; you are still a young man, still in your prime; let me\nentreat you to break off the chains which bind you, or rather, turn to\nGod to free you from the bondage of sin--the _slavery_ of sin--for it is\nslavery, Maythorne.\"\n\"I am very much obliged to you, Annabella, for your kindly interest, but\nI rather prefer deeds to words. Maythornes is pretty well stripped of\ntrees now, and I have all but exhausted the possibility of raising money\non it; but _laisser aller_ is my motto, and I am not the one to mourn\nover a dark, old-fashioned house, and lands which yield no produce; if\npossible, I shall cut the whole concern. Well, ta-ta, till to-morrow. I\nhave promised to hire horses and trot out Gratian over the Downs.\"\nMrs. Arundel felt that to say anything more would be worse than useless,\nand yet, as she watched her brother lounge across the road and stand on\nthe slope looking over the river, her eyes filled with tears.\n\"To think what he _might_ have been.

      "text": "him.\"\nGilbert had gone quickly away from Sion Hill, and found himself on the\nlower Downs--then not skirted by handsome houses, but with glades and\ngrassy slopes covered with hawthorn bushes, whitened in May-time with\nblossoms like snow, and covered in autumn with feathery masses of the\nwild clematis, or traveller's joy.\nGilbert found the place suited his mood, and he gave himself up to\nthoughts of Joyce, and forgot the late encounter with his uncle.\nHow delightful it was to build castles for the future--to think of a\nhome near all this loveliness, where Joyce would reign in all her sweet\nbeauty as his wife. The time had been when Gilbert had admired his\ncousin Gratian Anson, who was the daughter of his mother's aunt, and\ntherefore his cousin only in the second degree. Now her free, bold\nbearing, her ringing voice, her fashionable dress and banter, jarred on\nhim. Her laugh was like the rattle of a noisy brook over innumerable\nstones, when compared to Joyce's musical ripple, which was so real, and\nso entirely the outcome of her own happiness. Then how charming was her\nunconsciousness, and how her beauty was enhanced by the absence of all\naffectation; how pretty was her affection for her father and Piers, and\nhow gracefully and simply she did all the little household duties which\nher mother expected from her! Some words of a favourite poet of his\nmother's recurred to him, as he pictured Joyce in her little, short,\nlilac frock, with an apron, as he had seen her one morning, and her\nround white arms bare, as she came out of the dairy, and said she had\nmade up twenty pats of butter while he had been asleep. Surely George\nHerbert's words were verified.\nThe action was made fine by the spirit, which was done as a loving token\nof obedience to the will of another.\n\"Mother wished me to do it, so I got up an hour earlier,\" she had said,\nas she cut a slice from one of the rolls made for breakfast and offered\nit to him, spread with the butter she had made, with a cup of milk,\nbefore it had been skimmed.\nDreams of first love are very sweet; and Gilbert wondered if he had been\nwise to leave Fair Acres without getting a definite answer from Joyce\nherself.\nHonourable and straightforward, he determined not to return to Fair\nAcres unless prepared to ask her father's permission to lay all he had\nat her feet. He was conscious that at present that _all_ did not imply\nmuch, and besides, he had his mother to think of, and he must not marry\ntill he was really in a position to support a wife in that station of\nlife to which he had been called. He could wait for seven years, like\nJacob of old--waiting for Joyce was worth any sacrifice. But what if,\nwhen she emerged from her retirement and went to Barley Wood, some one\nelse might set his heart on the prize and win it. Then he recalled her\nwords, spoken in answer to his question as he carried her towards home\nthe evening before:\n\"No; I will not forget you.\"\nThey seemed to possess a double meaning as he repeated them again and\nagain, as he retraced his steps over the observatory towards Sion Hill.",

I wish to be your friend, as I have\nalways been, Gilbert. I was very sorry for you when you were so\nshamefully teazed by your young uncle; he does not like to be called\n_old_. I hope you noticed that.\"\n\"Oh! it is over now. I had no right to get into a rage.\"\n\"I think you had every right,\" Gratian said. \"He is too provoking;\nworse, since he has been so much in London, and welcomed, so we hear, by\nsome boon companions of His Majesty. But do not let us talk of him; let\nus talk of you. No; I don't choose to walk so near the edge of the\nrocks, if you do. Tell me about the people where you have been;--tell me\nabout the place. Is it a fine house, or a nice big farm? Fair Acres is a\npretty name, and are there no fair maidens as well as acres? Come,\nGilbert, you were not always so cross to me.\" This was said with a\ngentle pressure on his arm.\n\"I don't mean to be cross; but there is nothing at Fair Acres that would\ninterest you. You know about poor Melville already.\"\n\"I have heard of him,\" she said, \"and of your taking upon yourself to\nreform him. Well, who are the others?\"\n\"There are two fine boys, who want to be sailors, but they are too old,\nI am afraid, for the navy; they are thirteen.\"\n\"They--both thirteen!\"\n\"Yes, they are twins. Then there is a lame boy, Piers, a year younger.\nAnd oh, I forgot! a quiet, silent fellow, Ralph, he is sixteen.\"\n\"And does the great Melville, come next to him?\"\n\"Two little girls died. But there is a daughter of seventeen.\"\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed Gratian; \"I knew there was a daughter. Did I not tell\nyou I knew you were in love? Tell me her name. Come! We are such old\nfriends. Surely you might tell me.\"\n\"Really, Gratian, I will tell you Miss Falconer's name if you so\nparticularly wish to hear it. I--\"\n\"I will guess it. Let me see. I love my love with an A, because she is\namiable, and I took her to the sign of the Archer, and fed her with\napples, and her name is Angela. Not right? Well, I will go through the\nalphabet, and I must surely be right at last. I love my love with a\nB----.\"\n\"Pray stop,\" Gilbert said. \"I don't feel in a jesting mood, somehow.\"\n\"Not ready to wear a cap and bells? Poor Gilbert. You feel more like\nsitting under a willow tree and singing 'Poor Mary Anne.'\"\n\"Which is our house?\" Gilbert asked.\n\"Not that one; not up the steps. But you shall not go in till you tell\nme her name.\"\n\"She is called Joyce,\" Gilbert said, in despair.\n\"Ah! then you allow there is only one _she_ for you in all the world,\nand _she_ is called Joyce.\"\n\"Now, I do hope you are satisfied,\" Gilbert said.\nShe laughed that loud, ringing laugh, as she ran upstairs before him.\n\"Oh! of course I am satisfied,\" she said.\n[Illustration]",

They were a very\ndemonstrative pair, and, as we should say in these days, \"gushed\" over\neach other, but real love did underlie the fanciful expression of it;\nand Miss Falconer looked on Charlotte with the pride that a modeller in\nplastic clay, looks upon the work of his hands, and remembers how\ncarefully every detail has been wrought out, and how, in spite of a\nlittle flaw here and there, the result is satisfactory.",

A\nfarmboy lifted Joyce's box to the back seat, where she soon mounted\nwith a quick, alert spring, and then, with a shilling handed to the boy,\nthe squire drove off.\nJoyce's heart sank a little when they turned in at the gates of Barley\nWood.\n\"Are you coming in with us, father?\"\n\"No, no, my dear; I must get back as fast as I can. It is a good many\nmiles for Mavis at a stretch.\"\nThey drew up at the door, and an old servant answered the ringing of the\nbell, which Joyce had jumped down to pull by a handle, made of a deer's\nfoot. The servant's face was not very pleasant, and a forbidding looking\nwoman called out:\n\"Company! yes, there's nothing but company. There's no rest from it.\"\nThe boxes were taken down, and the squire, unwilling to prolong the\nparting, which he felt more keenly than he cared to own, waved his whip,\nand saying \"Good bye, my Sunshine, good-bye,\" drove off.\n\"This way,\" the woman said, passing across the hall and opening the door\nof a low, pretty room, sweet with that scent of rose leaves and\nlavender, which always belonged to the atmosphere of a country house\nlong ago. It was an aroma in which many scents blended, with no very\ngreat strength--a fragrance which dwells in the memory amongst the\npleasant things of early days.\nThere was nothing very striking about Barley Wood; it was simply a\npretty country residence--a place to live and die in. There was an air\nof tranquility about it, and an absence of anything like fashion or\nshow, which was very refreshing.\nMiss Frowde rose to greet the two girls, and, saying that Mrs. More\nwould see them after dinner, she led them to two rooms at the back of\nthe house, near the servants' quarters.\n\"The house will be full next week for the Bible meeting at Wrington, so\nwe thought you would not object to these rooms. I hope you will be\ncomfortable.\"\nThe rooms opened out of each other, and were very plain in their\nfurniture. Joyce, accustomed to her mother's scrupulous care about every\nlittle detail, noticed that the counterpane on her bed was a good deal\nrumpled, and there were rims of dust on the bosses of the old-fashioned\nround mirror. Evidently the servants at Barley Wood had not taken much\ntrouble about the guests.\nIndeed, the shameful neglect of Mrs. More's servants, and their bad\nconduct, had even then been canvassed by outsiders, though the old lady\nherself was perfectly unconscious of it.",

      "text": "The ingratitude of her servants, whom she had spoiled with such\nexcessive indulgence, was a dark cloud over Hannah More's last days, and\nsent her forth at last, with all the weight of her years upon her, to\nseek a new home, and turn her back on Barley Wood for ever.\nThe girls made a quick toilette and then went down, linked arm in arm,\nto the dining room, where Miss Frowde awaited them.\nThe beautiful valley in which Wrington lies, stretched out before the\nwindows, and the range of hills which enclosed it were shining in the\nfull light of the July afternoon.\nMiss Frowde was not very conversational; she asked a few common-place\nquestions, to which Joyce exerted herself to reply, but Charlotte took\nrefuge in silence; she was far too much occupied with considering what\nimpression she was making, to talk easily and naturally, as her cousin\ndid.\n\"I dare say you would like a turn in the grounds, after dinner,\" Miss\nFrowde said, \"and I will inquire when dear Mrs. More would like to see\nyou. It will only be one at a time; she is husbanding her strength for\nthe Bible meeting, when seventeen or eighteen friends will dine here.\"\nPresently one of the maid servants came into the room.\n\"Mrs. More wishes to see Miss _Fork_ner, and I was to say that the other\nmight go into the village with you, Miss Frowde, if she pleased.\"\n\"You had better go immediately,\" Miss Frowde said to Joyce. \"Dear Mrs.\nMore does not like to be kept waiting.\"\nJoyce rose at once and followed the maid to a small sitting room, where\nMrs. More was seated in a deep armchair.\nA large table was near her, covered with books and papers, and a small\nfire burned upon the hearth.\nJoyce felt as if she were going into the presence of royalty, and far\nmore in awe of Mrs. More, than she had done when offering her the milk\nat the carriage door, before Fair Acres.\nIndeed Hannah More had a certain queenly dignity about her, and the\nreflection of those palmy days when she was the admired of all admirers\nin the gay London world, the friend of Garrick and the great Dr.\nJohnson, did, in some degree, remain with her always.\nThe spiritual life in which she had lived and moved for so many years,\nhad lifted her far above the interests and pursuits which once she held\nto be the end and aim of life. Her religion was eminently practical, and\nto do good and to communicate was never forgotten. Nevertheless, the\nliterary efforts which had made her famous, her brilliant conversation,\nher intellectual powers, had given her a certain tone and dignity, which\nwhile attractive, might yet be called the air of superiority, which in\nthose days was conceded, to be as quite the proper attitude for any\nwoman who had made herself a name. Now, in the great crowd of authors\nand craftswomen of the pen, it is hard for anyone to lift her head above\nher neighbours.\nA thing of the past indeed it is to remember how famous \"the little\nBurney,\" as Dr. Johnson called her, became; how flattery was poured upon\nher, how no one dared to be jealous, because no one would dare to\nemulate her performances. To be great in London Society in Hannah More's\nearly days, was to be great indeed. The author of \"Percy\" was presented\nwith a laurel crown, the stems confined within an elegant ring, and\nGarrick himself read aloud the play to a select circle of admiring\nlisteners!\nBut though history repeats itself, and fashion ruled then as now, in\nliterature as in other things, I think there was more honest and kindly\nappreciation of the work of others than we have now-a-days.\nThe literary field was narrower, it is true, and therefore was not\nbroken up into plots, each plot hedged in by various conceits--a barrier\nthe uninitiated cannot pass. All flowers growing outside the barrier\nare called weeds; and if they are fragrant, they are pronounced sickly;\nif bright and vivid in colour, common. I may be wrong, but I think this\nself-sufficient, dogmatic criticism is very much on the increase, and\nthat the little jealousies and rivalries amongst men and women who\nfollow the same profession in art or literature grow more frequent.\nTongue and pen are often both too sharp; and the superficial chatter\nabout books and authors, pictures and music--both English and\nforeign--is too often passed as the real coin of the great realm of\nliterature, when it is but a base imitation, stamped, it may be, on a\nshowy surface with the same token, but utterly worthless when the first\nbrilliancy is worn off.\n\"Come, my dear Miss Falconer,\" was Mrs. More's greeting to Joyce; \"come\nand sit near me, that we may have a pleasant chat. Tell me how you have\nsped since I saw you, and whether you have studied the Book I gave you.\"\n\"Yes, madam,\" Joyce said, as she seated herself on a high Chippendale\nchair, the seat covered with fine cross-stitch, close to Mrs. More;\n\"yes, madam, I have read all the passages you marked; and I had no\nnotion before that the Bible was so beautiful.\"\n\"Ah, my child, it is a deep mine; its treasures do not lie on the\nsurface; and let me tell you that I, who have drunk of the waters at\nmany springs, find in the Bible alone, the living fountain of water.\nYour aunt told me she was anxious as to your education; she thought you\nneeded more than your good father found it convenient to give you.\"\n\"Father has so many boys,\" Joyce said, \"and, of course, boarding schools\nare very expensive. I have had to help mother a great deal at home, and\nI never wished to go to school. I think Aunt Letitia means by education\naccomplishments like Charlotte's, and I have none of them. But,\" Joyce\nwent on, \"I have a very clever brother, Ralph, and, when he is at home\nfor the holidays, I write his Latin exercises, and he corrects them, and\nI can read French with him; and then I know a good deal of natural\nhistory--because my brother Piers is lame, and nothing amuses him like\ncollections of birds, and moths, and insects.\"\n\"Well,\" Hannah More said, smiling, \"I think you have laid a very good\nfoundation; upon this, as you grow older, you can build up many fair\ntemples of knowledge, and I hope they will be ornamented by wisdom. You\nknow my story, I dare say.\"\nJoyce hesitated, \"I know you write plays and books. We have 'Christian\nMorals,' and 'Village Politics.' But----\"\n\"Oh,\" Hannah More said, \"those are my published works. I was alluding to\nthe story of my own life. I always like to bring it before the young,\nbecause I can say to them, I have tasted all the world can give, and\nfound it vanity. My dear, if I were now depending on the favours of the\ngreat for happiness, or the showering upon me of the fame which my\nliterary work brought me, where should I be? An old woman in her\neightieth year, can no longer dine with bishops and princes of the land.\nShe can take no part in routs, and theatres would be a weariness; but,\nthank God, and I beg you, my child, to mark this, I turned from those\nvanities to strive to serve the living God when I was in my heyday. And\nwhy? Because I felt them then to be _but_ vanity, often vexation of\nspirit, and the higher part of me loathed the false lustre of the gay\nworld.\"\nJoyce listened attentively to every word Mrs. More said, and her young\nheart gave in its allegiance to the beautiful old lady who, in her own\nbrilliant style, told her of the days of her youth, and of many little\nincidents connected with the names of distinguished men and women who",

Now, I alone am left, and can no longer give personal care\nto the work. But I have kindled the spark, with God's help, and I do\ntrust the light will shine over the hills of Somersetshire when I am\nlaid in yonder churchyard. The Mendip miners give me the most\nuneasiness; they are so rough, and wild, and lawless.\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said. \"We, that is, Mr. Arundel and I, met the man who had\nbeen brought before the magistrates at Wells, and he knocked down Mr.\nArundel, and----\"\n\"I heard of that. Poor Susan Priday, the man's daughter, has been a good\ngirl, and has had a sad life indeed.\"\n\"I felt so sorry for her,\" Joyce said, \"and I should like to help her.\nShe must be so unhappy with a bad father. If mother would let me, I\nshould like to have her in the kitchen; but I know she would not allow\nit.\"\nMrs. More smiled.\n\"I suppose your good mother thinks the education in our school has\nspoiled Susan for service.\n\"Mother is a good mistress,\" Joyce ventured to say, \"and cares for the\nmaids, as maids, but she has a notion that people who have to earn their\nbread, ought not to be able to read.\"\n\"Ah! that is a notion many have shared with your mother. Why, when the\ngreat Edward Colston first proposed to begin the good work of education\nin Bristol, he was voted by the Mayor and Aldermen as a dangerous\nperson, likely to turn the sons of the poor into vipers, who should\nsting the rich when once they were raised out of ignorance. All that\nfeeling has passed away in Bristol, as it will pass away in time in the\ncountry districts. Edward Colston's name is held now in honour; his\nschool sends out useful members of society year by year. Then there is\nRobert Raikes at Gloucester, how his work has taken root. So I comfort\nmyself with thinking that before this century has counted out its last\nyear, Hannah More's schools for the sons of the soil under Mendip, will\nhave won their way humbly but steadily to swell the great tide of\nprogress which is bearing us on its breast. It is a wonderful age!\" she\ncontinued. \"God has shown us marvellous things. Steam has become our\nservant, and its concentrated force seems likely to move kingdoms, and\nverify the prophecy that men shall go to and fro on the earth. Then in\nour cities coal-gas is captured, and turns night into day. Who shall say\nwhat hidden forces yet lie undiscovered, needing only the brain to\nconceive, and the hand of some Watt to demonstrate the power, lying\nconcealed in the mysteries of God's natural kingdom. Who was with you\non Mendip when the rough fellow attacked you?\"\n\"Mr. Arundel,\" Joyce said, in a low voice, the colour rising to her\nface.\nHannah More smiled, and said:\n\"Was he your _preux chevalier_?\"\nJoyce blushed a still rosier red.\n\"I don't understand,\" she said, simply.\n\"Your devoted knight!\"\n\"Of course, how stupid; but I so seldom hear French spoken; and I expect\nRalph and I have a strange pronunciation.\"\n\"French pronunciation can only be acquired by much speaking; and now\nfinish the story of your knight.\"\n\"Oh, it was only that the man, Susan's father, was angry, and wanted to\nforce me to give him money; and Mr. Arundel made him move out of the\nway, and then, of course, the man was furious, and hurled him down upon\nthe heather and gorse. We had lost our way, and father had to come out\nwith two men, and lanthorns to look for us.\"\nAll the time Joyce was speaking she felt those dark eyes were fixed on\nher, and she hurried on to the end of her story. Hannah More was too\nkeen an observer of faces not to read what was written on Joyce's; but\nshe only stroked the fair, rounded cheek gently, and said; \"We shall be\nfriends, I hope; there is only a short space in earth left for me, but,\nlong or short, you may reckon on my sympathy. We will talk about\neducation to-morrow. I have some letters demanding attention. That pile\nis yet unread; many are begging letters, some are even less pleasant\nthan that;\" and the old lady sighed. Even then the dishonesty and\nextravagance of her household were beginning to be noticed outside\nBarley Wood. Although her own eyes were blinded as to the cause, she\nfelt the results keenly.\nThis first day at Barley Wood was the beginning of a new life to Joyce.\nWhile Charlotte in her secret heart found the country dull, and almost\nwished herself back in Wells, a new world opened for Joyce. Mrs. More\nwould recite passages from Milton's \"Paradise Lost,\" and fill Joyce's\nmind with the beauties of the Garden of Eden, till she had thoughts for\nnothing else. Mrs. More told her she reminded her of a great man who on\nreading Milton for the first time, said he forgot that there was anyone\nelse in the world but himself and Adam and Eve!\nCharlotte dawdled over a bit of fancy work, which her aunt had hoped\nwould awake Mrs. More's admiration, but as it met with but faint praise,\nCharlotte felt herself aggrieved, and made various uncomplimentary\nremarks, in private, upon the coarse aprons which Miss Frowde produced\nas needlework which was _really_ wanted. But the stories of London life\npleased Charlotte, and she would wake up to interest when Mrs. More\ndescribed the grand routs where the \u00e9lite of London were gathered; of\nJohnson and his witty speeches; of Garrick, and of the continual round\nof gaiety which she had led, till she awoke from a dream to realities,\nand from those vanities to serve the living God.\nThe Bible meeting at Wrington was the great event of the year, and the\nvillage was in holiday trim. The bells rang from the noble church tower;\nthe school children, in clean white tippets and blue cotton frocks,\nwalked in procession to Barley Wood, where tea was provided for parents\nand teachers, and several of those who had come to the meeting addressed\nthem in simple words. Sir Thomas Acland had brought with him the Bishop\nof Ohio, and the good old man looked upon the scene before him, with\neyes dim with emotion. Here in this Somersetshire village, lying under\nthe range of low hills, had the influence of a good woman been felt. She\nhad borne bitter scoffs and rudeness from her enemies; she had been\nlaughed at even by her friends, and yet she had carried the banner of\nthe Lord onward, and now in her old age the victory was won. The people\nloved her, and though there were malcontents in Wrington, as in every\nother place, still the feeling for the good work the four sisters had\ndone, was stronger than that which was against it, and the Bible had\nbecome a treasure in many humble homes. No longer like that of which\nJoyce had spoken at Fair Acres--rarely opened and seldom read--nor like\nthe one described by Hannah More herself as the only one she found at\nCheddar, used to prop up a flower-pot in the window!\nThere was a large dinner-party of seventeen at Barley Wood after the\nmeeting, and this was a novelty to the two girls, who had never before\nsat down with so many at a table. Charlotte was in good spirits, having\ncaptured a pale-faced young clergyman, to whom she talked in her\nsentimental fashion, and who seemed almost as much fascinated by her, as\nshe intended he should be.\nJoyce, on the contrary, had no time to think of herself. She was\nintently listening to all that was said, and the conversation of those\nrefined and educated gentlemen charmed her. It was impossible not to be\nstruck with her beautiful face, glowing with interest and, though silent\nherself, showing that she was drinking in all that was said around her.\nIt was the same afterwards in Mrs. More's sitting-room, where all the\nguests gathered to sip fragrant tea and coffee, and talk over the\nburning questions of the day.\nThe good Bishop of Ohio, who had laboured long in the field abroad, as\nHannah More had laboured at home, knew well how rough was the road,\nwhich those who desire the highest good of others, must ever tread.\nHannah More was speaking of the deep anxiety that the condition of the\nMendip miners caused her, and how, of all her work, that seemed to be\nbringing forth the least fruit.\n\"An ear here and there is gathered,\" she said; \"but the harvest is scant\nindeed.\"\nJoyce, who had been listening earnestly, said:\n\"Susan Priday is an 'ear,' I am sure. She seemed to try to do all she\ncould, and--\"\nThe Bishop turned quickly. Joyce almost thought she ought not to have\nspoken, and that the Bishop and Mrs. More would think her forward, but\nthe good old man said:\n\"That is right, my dear young lady. It is well to remind our dear friend\nthat the grains she has scattered are not all in vain. Some will fall on\nthe good ground, and by God's blessing spring up and bear fruit. Who is\nSusan Priday?\"\n\"Come nearer the Bishop, Joyce,\" Mrs. More said, kindly, \"and tell him\nyour experience of Mendip miners, and of Susan also.\"\nJoyce did as she was told, and soon forgot her nervousness at being\ncalled upon to talk to so great a person as a Bishop, as she narrated\nwith sweet simplicity, and yet with dramatic power, the story which we\nalready know.\nBy degrees the voices of people in other parts of the room ceased, and\nJoyce found herself the centre of interest as she told her story.\n\"Who is she?\" Sir Thomas Acland asked, as Joyce finished her story, and",

She has led a very retired life\nat Fair Acres.\"\n\"There are many flowers that bloom unseen, and she is one of the fairest\nI ever saw. If a retired life produces such good effect, it strikes me,\nMrs. More, we had all better go into retirement. But--\"\nHe stopped, for Joyce, with a white face from which every vestige of\ncolour had vanished, came back to her position by Mrs. More's chair. Her\nhands were clasped tightly together, her whole attitude one of\nrepressed emotion.\n\"If you please, Mrs. More, I must beg you to excuse me. I am sent for to\ngo home, for my father--Oh! my father!--is dying.\"\nMiss Frowde was close behind Joyce.\n\"You must not agitate dear Mrs. More,\" she said. \"I will take care of\nMiss Falconer,\" she added. \"The gig is waiting.\"\n\"Do you know any particulars?\"\nMiss Frowde shook her head, and was leading Joyce away, when she\nsuddenly turned back.\n\"Dear madam, dear Mrs. More, please pray for me;\" and, unable to resist\nthe impulse, she threw her arms round the old lady's neck.\n\"Miss Falconer, indeed you must restrain your emotion; you will agitate\ndear Mrs. More.\"\nBut Hannah More held the trembling form of the poor stricken child\nclose.\n\"My dear,\" she whispered, \"many are the sorrows through which I have\npassed, and He whom I trust has never forsaken me. Trust in Him, and to\nHis loving kindness I commend you.\"\nJoyce raised herself from the old lady's arms, and the Bishop, deeply\nmoved, laid his hand upon her head.\n\"The Lord bless you and keep you, my child, now and evermore.\"\nJoyce did not weep or make any outward sign of great distress. She left\nall tears and cries to Charlotte, who, sincerely grieved, took care that\nevery one should know it.\n\"Shall I come? Shall I come with you? Oh, Joyce--my darling Joyce! Oh\ndear! Oh dear!\"\n\"No, Charlotte; don't come; don't come. Help me to fasten my cloak. I--I\ncan't find the clasp.\"\nMiss Frowde thrust Charlotte aside, and fastening Joyce's cloak, seemed\nonly anxious to get her off as speedily as possible. It was a very\ninconvenient episode; and if Mrs. More were the worse for the excitement\nit would be very disastrous. Secretly Miss Frowde wished she could get\nrid of Charlotte too, but as she only wept and moaned, and made no\nattempt to put her things together, Miss Frowde refrained from urging\nher to do so. Miss Frowde was not unkind or unfeeling, she was simply\nand absolutely devoted to Mrs. More; and, indeed, it was well that she\nwas always at hand to perform the hundred and one kindly offices, which\nthe spoiled and pampered domestics neglected.\nJoyce was soon ready, Charlotte clinging to her to the last, and\nfollowing her to the hall, with sobs and tears.\nNevertheless, as the gig drove off, and the wheels crunched the gravel",

Joyce sprang down and\npassed in, throwing off her large bonnet, and unfastening the clasp of\nher cloak, which seemed like to choke her.\nIn the supreme moments of life the most trivial things always seem to\nfasten upon the outward senses, as if to show, by force of contrast, the\nenormous proportions of the great trouble--or the great joy, it may\nbe--which is at the time overshadowing us.\nSo Joyce, as she stood in the hall, noticed that one of the stag's\nglass eyes had dropped out and lay upon the bench upon which Gilbert\nArundel had sat on the night of their adventure on the moor. She saw,\ntoo, lying there, a large pair of scissors, and a roll of lint lay on\nthe window-seat, with a basin in which the water was coloured a pale\ncrimson. \"They bandaged his head here,\" she thought,--and she was going\nupstairs, when slow, heavy, jerky footsteps were heard, and Duke came\ndown, and, putting his nose into her hand, whined a low, piteous whine.\n\"Oh! Duke, Duke, where is he?\"\nAs if he understood her human speech--as, indeed, he did, Duke turned to\nprecede her upstairs.\nOn a bench in the long corridor two maid servants were seated, crying\nbitterly. But Joyce did not speak to them, she dared not; even the\nquestion she had asked Duke died on her lips.\nThe door of her father's room was ajar; and as Duke pushed it open with\nhis nose, Joyce could see the great four-post bed, her mother sitting by\nit, and curled up in the window-seat was Piers.\nThe friends who had been there in the early part of the day were gone;\nthey could do no more at Fair Acres. And Mr. Paget's aim was to set the\nconstables to work to find the man who must have hurled a sharp stone at\nMr. Falconer's head. The Wells doctor, too, was gone. He had a pressing\ncase near Wells upon his hands, but he was to return at eight o'clock,\nwhen, it was hoped the doctor greater than himself, who had been\nsummoned from Bristol, would have arrived.\nIn those days help in emergency was slow to obtain.

The boy was very calm, but great tears fell upon Joyce's hand as\nshe pressed him close.\nThe silent watch went on. Duke lay motionless, but his eyes were on the\nalert. The servants looked in sometimes, and brought Joyce and her\nmother some tea and cake. Joyce swallowed a cup of tea, but ate nothing.\nCould this be the evening of the day which dawned so brightly?--the\nWrington bells chiming, the village children singing hymns, joyousness\nand gladness everywhere. The guests gathered round Mrs. More; the\nbright, intelligent conversation to which she was listening; then her\nown narrative of the Mendip adventure;--and this brought her to the\npresent from the past!\nIf her father had been assailed by a malicious miner on Mendip, that\nassailant was Bob Priday; of this she felt no doubt.\nThe Bristol doctor came, and the Wells doctor and they held a\nconsultation. But there was nothing to be done; the injury Mr. Falconer\nhad received was mortal.\n\"Will he give no sign, no word that he knows us?\" Mrs. Falconer asked.\n\"Oh, for one word!\"\n\"We do not think there will be any return of consciousness,\" the doctors\nsaid, \"but we cannot tell.\"\nNo; no one could tell. And so the sad hours of the night passed, and the\ndawn broke over the familiar fields, and Fair Acres smiled in the first\nbright rays of the morning.\nPiers had slept curled up in his window-seat, worn out with grief. Mrs.\nFalconer, too, had slept in an upright position, her head resting\nagainst the back of the chair, sleeping for sorrow.\nBut Joyce did not sleep; she kept watch, hoping, praying for one word of\nfarewell.\nAs the first sunbeam slanted through the casement, her father opened his\neyes, and fastened them on Joyce. \"Sunshine,\" he said, with a faint\nsmile. \"Dear child.\"\n\"Dearest father, dear father!\"\n\"I hope my little girl will be named after my mother, _Joyce_. Yes, it\nis an old-world name, but I fancy it; name her Joyce.\"\nThe sound of his master's voice roused Duke, who pricked his ears and\ncame to the bedside. Mrs. Falconer also started and awoke.\n\"There is a word I cannot catch, about the _Life_. Try to think of it.

By interest exerted by the Bishop of Bath and Wells, Harry and\nBunny both got into the navy, and went forth, poor little boys, full of\nhope and delight, to encounter the hardships which then were the\nuniversal fate of little middys, in their first acquaintance with the\nsalt sea waves they loved so well.\nIt was touching to see the young brother and sister, who were left at\nthe head of affairs, resolutely doing their utmost to spare their\nmother, and to keep things, as Mr. Watson called it, \"square.\"\nIf he were old he was intensely useful and honourable; and Ralph's power\nto adapt himself to his new manner of life was really wonderful. He set\nhimself to study the few and scanty agricultural books which were on his\nfather's shelves, and mastered the accounts in a way which Mr. Gell, the\nlawyer, and Mr. Paget, the executor under the will, found to be\nsurprising.\nMiss Falconer had sent many kind little notes on very deep black-edged\npaper, and sealed with a large black seal, to \"her dear afflicted\nsister;\" and Charlotte, who had returned from Barley Wood on the day\nafter Joyce left it, composed verses of doubtful rhythm, and still more\ndoubtful sense, which she sent, done up in brown paper parcels by the\ncarrier, as they were too voluminous to be conveyed in any other way.\nVerses in which \"bleeding hearts\" and \"rivers of tears,\" sought vainly\nfor appropriate rhymes; where \"fears\" refused to follow \"bears,\" and\n\"eyes\" was made to do duty again and again with \"prize\" and \"sighs.\"\nMrs. More wrote a tender letter of sympathy to Joyce, and would have\ndriven over to see her, had not the shortening days and threatened cold\nkept her a close prisoner. Indeed, she was laid low with one of her most\ndangerous illnesses before September was over; and Miss Frowde and her\ndoctor thought it more than doubtful if, at her advanced age, she would\nrecover.\nIt was on a still October afternoon, when autumnal stillness reigned in\nthe woods and fields, that Joyce went to the seat under the fir trees to\nbe alone with her sorrow. The grassy slope was slippery now with recent\nrain, and though the clouds had rolled off eastward, the sunshine was\npale and watery, coming in fitful gleams through the veil of thin misty\nvapour which hung over the sky.\nJoyce often came to this seat; it was associated with her father, and\nshe loved to be there and give full vent to the sorrow which, for the\nsake of others, she had learned to hide. Miss Falconer and Charlotte had\npaid one visit of condolence after the funeral. They were surprised, and\nI may even say disappointed, to see Joyce so calm, and Miss Falconer\nthought how different it would be with Charlotte when she was taken from\nher; she would be entirely prostrate and unfit for exertion.\nIt is well for the world that some people are fit for exertion, even in\nthe midst of crushing sorrow. It would be a melancholy thing if all\ngrief-stricken ones fed on their grief in solitude, and shut themselves",

The beautiful tie between father and daughter, which when it\nexists is one of the most beautiful in the world, seemed severed,\ncruelly severed, and Joyce was desolate. She was scarcely eighteen, and\nthe freshness and gladness of her life hitherto had been remarkable.\nNow, all unawares, the storm had swept over her sky, and, when it\npassed, left her lonely indeed.\nMrs. Falconer was one of those people who bury their dead out of sight,\nand cannot bear the mention of their names. Ralph, setting his face\nbravely to meet his duty, did not speak of his father as Joyce would\nhave loved to speak of him, and it was only to Piers, that Joyce could\nsometimes ease her burdened heart, by talking of her father. Just as on\nthe summer morning, now looking so far off, left in the golden haze of\njoy and glad young life, Joyce had seen her lame brother at the gate of\nthe plantation, so she saw him now.\nShe made a great effort to control her weeping, and said:\n\"It is very slippery on the turf to-day; wait, dear, and I will come\ndown to help you.\" But Piers said:\n\"I want _you_ to come down; I don't want to come up.\"\n\"Is anything the matter?\"\nPiers did not answer, and in another minute Joyce was at his side.\n\"Joyce, there is a woman hiding under the maples and brambles.\"\n\"A woman? Perhaps she is one of the women employed on the farm.\"\n\"I don't know,\" said Piers, \"I wish you would come and see who it is.\"\n\"Very well, dear,\" Joyce said; \"you are sure it is a _woman_?\"\n\"Yes, and she is crying and sobbing.\"\nJoyce followed Piers along the shrubbery path, now covered with a new\nlayer of fallen leaves, and, at the turn of a still narrower side path,\nshe saw, half hidden by the brambles and undergrowth, a woman; her head,\nbowed upon her hands, and her attitude one of despair.\nJoyce went near and said: \"What is the matter? Are you in pain? Can I\nhelp you?\"\nThe woman raised her head, and Joyce recognised at once that she was\nSusan Priday.\nThoughts of the night on Mendip; of the fierce onslaught made on Gilbert\nArundel by the big giant, and the almost certainty she felt, that the\ncruel blow aimed at her father was by the same hand, made Joyce start\nback and say, coldly:\n\"You had better not stay here, these are private grounds.\"\nPiers, who was leaning against the bole of a beech tree, said:\n\"Yes; get up and go away. I will show you the gate into the road.\"\n\"Lady,\" said the girl, passionately, \"I came to see _you_. I saw you\nsobbing and crying on the bench yonder, for I got into the plantation\nthat way. I heard you sob, and call 'Father,' and then my heart nearly\nbroke, and I came round at the back and got over the hedge. I felt as if\nI dare not speak to you. Do you know me, lady?\"\n\"Yes,\" Joyce said; \"of course I see who you are, but I--I cannot do\nanything for you, and we are all in great grief, very, very great\ngrief,\" Joyce said, with a sudden spasm of agony in her voice.\n\"I know it, I know it, that's why I came; and I'm in grief, too. Father\nis gone away, no one knows where; the boys have run off, and, oh! the\nbaby is dead. I did think I'd keep him, for mother's sake; but, in a\ndrunken fit, father threw a pot of boiling water at me. It missed me,\nand the baby caught it on his neck and face, and it scalded him\ndreadful. The school mistress was kind, and so was Mrs. Amos, she that\nowns the farm; but he died--he died--and I am all alone. Oh! Miss, oh!\ndear young lady, pity me.\"\n\"I do pity you,\" Joyce said. \"But where is your father? For you must be\naware that suspicion points to him as the cause of my--of my dear\nfather's death.\"\n\"Yes, I do know it. Oh! miss, forgive me, and let me come and serve\nyou. I want no wage; but I'd die for you, if that would do you good. I\nhave never forgot your face that night, nor how you spoke soft then\ninstead of angry. Oh, miss, let me come and live with you. I will sleep\non the ground. I'll do the work of two in the dairy, or in the house,\nand I want no wage. Poor mother always said God would take care of me,\nbut He has taken away the baby, He has, that is the cruellest part. And\nfather; oh! miss, you can't tell what it is to be filled with shame\nabout a father.\"\n\"No, indeed,\" Joyce said. \"No; I know what it is to be proud of one, and\nto----\" Her voice broke down, and Piers said:\n\"She ought to go away, Joyce; she can't be left here.\"\nBut Joyce seemed to be thinking for a few minutes. Here was a girl whose\nfather had, as everyone thought, been the cause of her father's death;\nhere was the daughter of this man, coming to her and begging to be taken\ninto the house, to be her servant? Was it possible?\nWith a discretion far beyond her years, Joyce said, \"I will make\ninquiries about you from the school mistress, and if I find you really\nbear a good character, I will get you a place, and----\"\n\"I want no place apart from _you_\" the girl said, passionately. \"If I\ncould die to undo my father's wicked deed, I would die, and,\" she added,\nsadly, \"it ain't much I have to live for now the baby's gone. But if you\nwon't take me, well, I'll tramp to Bristol; and if I can't get bread in\nan honest way, I must get it somehow else.\"\n\"No, no; don't say that. I must consider and think, and if I can take",

Oh! dear lady, ever since night and day, night\nand day, I have prayed for you, and that God would keep you.\"\nThere was something in the girl's despairing voice which touched Joyce\nto the heart.\n\"Come round to the kitchen door with me,\" she said, \"and I will see that\nyou have rest and food. I am sure you want both.\"\n\"I don't want rest; there is no rest in me, and food chokes me.\"\nBut Joyce took no notice of this, and saying, decidedly, \"follow me,\"\nshe put her hand on Piers' shoulder, and they went through the\nplantation to the house, skirting it to the left instead of crossing\nit, and so round to the stable-yard and the back premises.\nMrs. Falconer never had old maid servants; she trained girls to fill the\nplaces in her household, and of these, there was an endless stream\npassing through. The two in the kitchen now were both kindly,\ngood-tempered girls, utterly ignorant, but simple-hearted and honest.\n\"I want this poor young woman,\" Joyce said, \"to rest by the fire; and\ngive her her supper before she leaves. Sarah, do you hear me?\" Joyce\nsaid.\n\"Yes, miss, I hear,\" Sarah said, surveying the poor, forlorn girl with\nscorn. \"Yes, miss. I don't know whether missis would hold with taking in\na tramp like her.\"\n\"I am going to ask mother now,\" Joyce said; \"and I know you are\nkind-hearted, Sarah, and that you will attend to this poor girl, because\nI wish it.\"\nSarah gave a low sound, which was taken for consent; and Joyce, judging\nrightly that Susan Priday would be better left to the servants, went to\nfind her mother.\nAs she crossed the hall she met Ralph.\n\"There are letters from Italy,\" he said. \"Melville had not heard when he\nwrote.\"\n\"Where are the letters?\" Joyce asked.\n\"Mother has them. There is one for you--not from Italy though; it has\nthe Bristol post-mark, and is franked. There was an immense deal to pay\nfor Melville's.\"\nJoyce waited to hear no more, but went to her mother. She was sitting\nwith her son's letter open before her. It began, \"Dear father and\nmother,\" and these words went like a knife through Joyce's heart.\nMrs. Falconer sat day after day in the same chair by the fire-place. Her\nlarge widow's cap--in those days an immense erection of many thick\nfrillings, and with long \"weepers\" falling over her shoulders--altered\nher so entirely, scarcely any one would have recognised her.\nJoyce glanced through the letter. It was as self-sufficient and trifling\nas ever. Melville found foreign travel less delightful than he had\nexpected.\nThe diligence was then the universal mode of transit through France, and\nthe two travellers had taken a whole month to reach Hy\u00e8res, a journey\nwhich can now be got through in three days at the longest calculation.\nMelville complained of the food and the cramped diligence, and how the\nsmell of garlic made him sick; and how old Crawford was as \"stiff as\nstarch,\" and that he did not think he should stay away long.\nOf Genoa la Superba not a word, except to say that he had seen a fine\ncopy of one of Raphael's pictures for sale, which, if his father would\nsend the money, he would buy, for the dining hall at Fair Acres.\nJoyce had hardly patience to finish the letter; but her mother said:\n\"Give the letter to me, Joyce.\" And then she smoothed the thin sheet of\nforeign paper tenderly, and, refolding it, placed it in her large\nwork-box, which stood unused by her side.\nJoyce, meantime, opened the other letter, and a bright flush came over\nher face. She could not read it there; she put it into her deep pocket,\nand said:\n\"Dear mother, a poor girl is in the kitchen; she is utterly friendless\nand forlorn. May I let her sleep in the empty attic to-night, till I\nmake inquiries about her of the mistress of one of Mrs. More's schools\nto-morrow?\"\n\"You can do as you like, Joyce,\" was the reply, as poor Mrs. Falconer\nrelapsed into her usual condition of dreary silence, after kindling into\nsome interest about Melville's letter.\n\"You can do as you like--my day is over.\"\n\"Mother, dearest mother, do not say so; you will feel better soon. It\nis--it is the suddenness of the blow that has come upon you--and upon us\nall--that has stunned you. Do try to take comfort.\"\n\"Comfort, Joyce! You don't know what you are saying. I lived for your\nfather--and I have lost him. It was cruel, cruel to take him in his\nprime, to leave me desolate!\"\n\"You have got us children to love you, mother,\" Joyce ventured to say;\n\"and think how good Ralph is, giving up everything he cared for most, to\ntake up the business of the farm.\"\n\"As if he could do that,\" was the reply. \"Ralph is not fit for it.\"\n\"Mr. Watson says it is wonderful how he has fallen into the ways of\npeople on the estate. He has such a firm will and purpose in everything\nhe does.\"\nMrs. Falconer sighed.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"I don't want to talk any more about it. I think if\nyou will get me the yarn I will go on knitting Harry's stockings.\"\n\"Oh, yes,\" Joyce said; \"and Piers will be so pleased to hold the skeins\nfor you, mother.\"\nThen she kissed her mother again and again, and whispered:\n\"You will come to church on Sunday, mother, won't you? It is so dull for\nyou, sitting here day after day.\"\n\"I can do nothing else,\" was the reply--\"nothing else. What else should\nI do? You are a dear, good child, Joyce. He always said so; he was\nalways right.\"\nThere is nothing harder to meet than a grief like poor Mrs. Falconer's;\nor rather, I should say, there is nothing harder to meet than a grief\nwhich refuses to recognise love in the midst of anguish which hardens\nand, as it were, paralyzes the whole being; changes the fountain of\nsweetness into bitterness; making the accustomed routine of duty\nimpossible and falling on the sufferer like a heavy pall.\n\"Missus is like somebody else; can't believe it is missus at all,\" the\nmaids said, when Joyce returned with the orders for poor Susan to remain\nall night, and to be cared for till the morning.\nThe poor girl was so utterly exhausted that she had fallen asleep, her\nface hidden on her arm, her elbows on the kitchen table; and her\nattitude of utter helplessness touched Joyce.\n\"Be kind to her,\" she said; \"she is very unhappy. Be kind to her, Sarah.\nI know you _will_ be kind to her as I wish it.\"",

But I remember your parting words, your kind\npromise not to forget me. Thus I venture to tell you that I bear\nyou ever in my mind, and that the time may come, _will_ come, when\nI shall beg you to hear more from me than I can say now, and grant\nme a very earnest petition. But not now would I speak of myself or\nof my hopes and fears. Rather would I tell you how I pray God to\ncomfort you for the loss of a father, whom I count it an honour to\nhave known. I would ask you to believe that I, who have had the\nprivilege of watching the happy home-life--now, alas! so sadly\nbroken up--can, at least, understand what the wreck must be. Please\npresent my regards and sympathy to Mrs. Falconer, and assure her\nof my remembrance of her kindness to me while her guest at Fair\nAcres, if indeed you think I may venture so far.\n\"I remain, dear Miss Falconer,\n\"Your very faithful and true\n\"GILBERT DECOURCY ARUNDEL.\"\nThere was a postscript written on the blank part of the sheet of Bath\npost, which was folded over.\n\"My mother is likely to visit the Palace, at Wells, in November. I\nhave charged her, if possible, to see you at Fair Acres. I have\nheard nothing from your brother, but I am well satisfied that he is\nout of England, for reasons which you know.--G. DeC. A.\"\nThe reserved style of this letter, so different from the random shots of\nthe present day, when young men and maidens seem to think the form of a\ntelegram the most appropriate way of expressing their thoughts, may\nprovoke a smile, and be pronounced priggish and formal. But in Joyce's\neyes it was a perfect letter, and she felt it to be a support and\ncomfort to her in her loneliness. Words which come from the heart seldom\nmiss their aim; and Joyce felt that, underlying those carefully written\nlines, there was the certainty that if her promise to him was\nfulfilled, and that she thought, even in her sorrow, of him continually,\n_he_, on his part, did not forget her.\nIn the simplicity of her young heart, she had never dreamed that Gilbert\ncould really care for her, and his long silence had made her think of\nhim only as of someone who had passed out of her life, and was to be in\nfuture but a memory. Now the fluttering hope became almost a certainty,\nand she repeated to herself many times that evening, as a bird repeats\nits song over and over with the same rapture of content--\n\"I bear you ever in my mind, and the time may come, _will_ come, when I\nwill beg you to hear more from me than I dare to say now, and grant me a\nvery earnest petition.\"\n\"The time _will_ come--the time _will_ come, and, meanwhile, I can\nwait,\" she thought. \"Yes, the time will come, and I can wait.\"\n[Illustration]",

The sky was blue, the air soft and\nbalmy, and the sunshine lay upon the peaceful city, once more the City\nof Rest, which the good Bishop had called it when he first viewed the\nscene of his future labours as chief pastor of the diocese of Bath and\nWells.\nThe noise and tumult of the fifth of November seemed now like a troubled\ndream. Once more the only sounds which broke the silence were the chime\nof bells for service, the trickling of streams of water, the cawing of\nrooks in the elm trees by the moat, the chatter of the Jackdaws as they\nswung in and out of their nests on the cathedral towers. All within and\naround the Palace was calm and quiet.\nAnd in the market square every sign of the late uproar was removed, the\n_d\u00e9bris_ cleared away; the cry of a child, the foot-fall of a\npedestrian, or the low rumble of a distant cart, was heard with that\nwonderful distinctness which is born of surrounding stillness. Here and\nthere a word was exchanged with a customer by the master of a shop, who,\nstanding at the door, looked out upon the world with that quiet patient\nexpectation of custom, unknown in busy, populous towns.\nAs the Bishop's carriage drove through the market-place, several\nfigures appeared at the doors of the shops. The carriage was watched\nout of sight, the heads of the watchers were turned right and left, and\nthen the figures disappeared again, like those weather-wise men and\nwomen in the old-fashioned barometers now, like many other quaint\ndevices almost unknown.\nIf the day were fair and beautiful in Wells, it was doubly beautiful in\nthe country. Joyce felt its influence, and, for the first time since her\nfather's death, she sang gently to herself as she went about her\nhousehold duties.\nSince she had received Gilbert Arundel's letter, a ray of brightness had\npierced the cloud. She had not answered it, for he had asked for no\nanswer. And Joyce, in the sweet simplicity of her faith in him told\nherself, that she had given her promise not to forget him, and that in\nthat promise he was resting till the time came for him to ask her that\nquestion, which he said he must ask, and to present the petition which\nhe hoped she would grant.\nOf course she was ready to give him what he asked for, but there was to\nher nature, always trusting and transparent, no hardship in waiting.\n\"If I doubted him I could not wait so patiently,\" she thought, \"but I\n_trust_ him.\"",

The Cambridge\nmen are even worse than the Oxford men. However, I won't quarrel with\nGilbert about that, and I can take a little preachment from him. Aunt\nBella is pleased with anything Gilbert says or does; and as to\nMaythorne----\"\nJoyce started, very visibly this time, at that name, and said,\nwithdrawing her hand from her companion's arm, and stooping to gather\nsome sprigs of lavender:\n\"I suppose Lord Maythorne is a relation of yours?\"\n\"Distant; very distant,\" was the reply. \"A connection is nearer the\ntruth.\"\n\"Because,\" Joyce said, \"I think he is a very bad and wicked man, and I\nwish you could tell him never to come here again.\"\n\"Come here! Has he been here,\" Gratian exclaimed. \"What on earth did he\ncome here for?\"\n\"He had not been gone half-an-hour before the Bishop's carriage drove\nup. He has, as you know, done my eldest brother a great deal of\nmischief; and, though my dear father thought he had cleared all his\ndebts, this Lord Maythorne says that he still owes him a great deal, and\nwe cannot pay it.\"\n\"And is that what he came to say; very kind and pleasant of him, I must\nconfess. I expect he said a great deal more.\"\nJoyce blushed scarlet.\n\"He was very impertinent,\" she said, \"and talked in a very free way to\nme, but it is over now, and I wish to forget it. Only, if you can, will\nyou prevent him from coming again; or as he is Mrs. Arundel's brother,\ncould you ask _her_ to prevent him. When I have consulted Mr. Paget,\ndear father's executor and our trustee, I will try if any of the money\ncan be paid.\"\n\"Don't think of paying a farthing,\" Gratian said, \"pray; I will see what\nI can do in the matter. I will talk to Gilbert. Gilbert is certain to do\nwhat I ask him, and I know how much he cared about your brother. Yes,\nyou may depend upon my doing my best, you darling!\" Gratian said,\nstooping down and kissing Joyce's rounded cheek.",

For the minor canon was one of a long list of visionary\nadmirers, and he had been followed by the pale-faced clergyman she had\nmet at Barley Wood, about whom, during the few days Charlotte had spent\nat Fair Acres, she had talked, till Joyce grew weary of the theme.\n\"Such nonsense!\" she had said. \"Besides, no girl ought to acknowledge\nherself to be in love till she has had good reason given her. It is not\nnice; it is not womanly.\"\nAnd as day by day passed, and night after night, when she leaned against\nthe casement of her window, when the stars were throbbing and shining in\nthe deep-blue of the winter's sky, she had to confess, with deep\nabasement of spirit, that she had been as weak as poor Charlotte, nay,\nweaker; for as Charlotte's heroes fell from their pedestals, or vanished\ninto thin air like the mirage in the desert, she could always replace\nthem, and pour forth her romantic soul in verses addressed to new\nobjects, as if the old had never existed.\nBut Joyce told herself she must suffer the consequences of her weakness\nfor ever and a day. No one could ever again be to her what Gilbert had\nbeen, in that first happy time of awakening love.\nJoyce's pale cheeks and wistful eyes at last attracted her mother's\nnotice. In these days she would have been taken to see a doctor, ordered\nchange of air and scene, and put upon some _r\u00e9gime_ as to food.

Mrs. Law,\ngentle and kindly, had taken an interest in the young people in Wells,\nand had invited Charlotte, amongst others, to tea. Tea at six o'clock,\non some day when the bishop and his chaplain and Mr. Henry Law, were\nabsent on some business in the diocese.\nIf it had been a great thing to visit Mrs. Hannah More at Barley Wood,\nit was a greater to take tea at the palace. With the wigs of the last\nand preceding century, the bishops have thrown off a great deal of the\nepiscopal state, which was once considered a part of the duty of the\npeer spiritual. And a certain air of solemnity pervaded the Wells\npalace, even when presided over by such true \"gentlefolks\" as the\nbishop and Mrs. Law. That old-fashioned word seems to suit the host and\nhostess at the Wells palace far better than any other term I could use.\nThat innate grace and refinement of feeling is sometimes, it is true,\nacquired, but it is a plant of slow growth, especially amongst those,\nwho suddenly raised to a position of importance in the Church, feel the\nelevation makes them a little dizzy. The Bishop's wife, then presiding\nover the palace, had always moved in the higher circles of society, and,\ntherefore, neither at Carlisle nor Wells did she find it necessary to\nimpress upon humbler people that she stood on a vantage ground to which\nfew could approach. She was dignified, though she was gentle, and no one\nwould ever pass the barrier which divides familiarity, from free and\npleasant intercourse. Mrs. Law, like everyone else, was greatly taken\nwith Joyce Falconer; and again poor Charlotte began to feel that with no\neffort at all her cousin was winning her way, and making an impression",

The footman waited for a reply, and the discussion of\nMrs. Law's note caused no little excitement in the parlour, of which the\nservant, if he had been so minded, could have heard every word.\n\"My dear Joyce, what will you do? You have no suitable dress for such a\nvisit; and yet it is a pity to miss it. I really do not know what to\nadvise.\"\n\"I think I should like to go to the palace, Aunt Letitia,\" Joyce said.\n\"Like! yes; but are you prepared for such a visit?\"\n\"Oh! yes; I have my best frock, the black bombazine, and my crape\nbonnet. That need not hinder me.\"\n\"But, my dear, people in Mrs. Law's position wear evening gowns, with\nlow necks and short sleeves. _I_ have moved in these circles, and of\ncourse----\"\n\"We must not keep the servant waiting, Aunt Letitia; if you give me\nleave, I should like to accept the invitation.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Miss Falconer; \"there is my writing-case; take care\nhow you write; begin, 'Miss Joyce Falconer presents her respects.'\"\n\"But Mrs. Law addresses me as, 'Dear Miss Falconer'; had I not better\nbegin, 'Dear Madam, or dear Mrs. Law'?\"\n\"Oh! _not_ 'Dear Mrs. Law.' My dear child, how ignorant you are of\netiquette.\"\nJoyce seated herself, and wrote a few words accepting the invitation\nfrom Saturday to the Monday following, and took it herself to the\nfootman.\n\"You should have rung for Phoebe, really Joyce, my _dear_!\" But it was\ntoo late. Charlotte, who had been \"composing\" in the sitting-room\nupstairs, had heard voices, and now came down just as Joyce had closed\nthe door on the footman from the palace.\n\"An invitation to _stay_ at the palace! Oh! Joyce, how fortunate you\nare. Mrs. Law might have asked me!\"\n\"She knows you live in the place, my love,\" said Miss Falconer.\nCharlotte sighed. \"If I did _not_ live here it would be all the same.\"\nBut Charlotte was really an amiable girl, and her devotion to Joyce was\nsincere and true.\n\"Well,\" she said, \"what will you wear, dear? Can I lend you any pretty\nthings? My amber beads--or--my filigree comb. Oh! I forgot! Of course,\nyou are still in deep black.\"\n\"It is very kind of you, Charlotte,\" Joyce said; \"you always are kind;\nbut I don't want anything.\"\nThe whole of that day Joyce's visit to the palace engrossed the little\nparty in the Vicar's Close. Some cronies of Miss Falconer came in for a\ngossip by the fireside, and were duly informed of the invitation, and\nwere duly congratulatory and a little jealous, although there was a\ncertain amount of satisfaction, that it was not Charlotte whom Mrs. Law\nhad delighted to honour.",

It was a time and place for the exchange of first young\nlove, and confidences never to be forgotten.\nAnd in all the changes and chances of her future life, Joyce could look\nback to that first spring afternoon, and say from her heart that it was\nthe opening for her of a new and beautiful chapter. If the hopes of the\nearlier days of their acquaintance had lain dormant during the winter,\nthey now sprang up with the coming life of the spring time, and were\nsweet with the promise of the future.\nWhen once Gilbert had found voice to tell his story he was eloquent, and\nwhen once Joyce had given her response there was no further need for\nreticence.\n\"And why did you not write to me?\" he asked.\n\"As I said, because you did not ask me; and then when your uncle came,\nhe told me that you cared for Miss Anson; and I thought, _half_ thought,\nit might be true.\"\nGilbert made an impatient gesture.\n\"You only _half_ thought so; you knew, Joyce, you knew better. So,\" he\nwent on under his breath, \"that is the mischief he went to Fair Acres to\nwork.

Gently,\nFalcon, gently; don't pull dear old Duke so roughly.\"\n\"I want to take Duke to Bristol, mother; Grannie has left Fair Acres,\nand she is old; why shouldn't Duke?\"\n\"Duke would not be happy in Great George Street; would you, dear Duke?\"\nJoyce bent down to the grizzled head of the friend of so many years, and\nsaid:\n\"Ah! Duke, we are all getting old.\"\nPresently more voices were heard in the hall, and Mrs. Falconer appeared\nwith a little grand-daughter on either side, while Susan Priday brought\nup the procession with the baby in her arms.\n\"Now, dear mother, I think we are all ready. Have you enough wraps?\nWhere are Melville and Gratian and Piers?\"\n\"Melville is not dressed,\" said Piers, coming forward, \"and Gratian has\njust had her cup of chocolate taken her in bed.\"\n\"I must run and say Good-bye to her,\" exclaimed Joyce. \"What a pity to\nlie in bed on this lovely morning!\"\nJoyce tripped upstairs and tapped at the door of the room which had been\nher mother's in years past.\nTo the amazement of all the world, Gratian Anson had signified to\nMelville Falconer that she was ready to be mistress of Fair Acres, and\ninclude him in the bargain. On the whole the plan had answered fairly\nwell; but Mrs. Falconer had found the new _r\u00e9gime_ a perpetual vexation,\nand three years before this time had, by her son-in-law's advice,\nretired to a little cottage on Clifton Down with Piers, within reach of\nthe great joy and comfort of her declining years--Joyce and her husband\nand children.\nGratian kept Melville in good order. There were rumours in the\nneighbourhood that she took charge of the purse, and that an allowance\nwas doled out to her lord and master, which she never permitted him to\nexceed. However that might be, Gratian certainly managed to get through\nwithout heavy debts, and the squire's will had provided for the\nmaintenance of his widow, and the boys had each their portion paid from\nthe estate.\nMr. Watson and Ralph virtually managed the farm, and Ralph held a good\nposition and was greatly respected. Only one of the twins was left. The\nsea rolled over the bright hair of Bunny, on his second voyage. He was\nwashed from the mast by a huge wave, off the coast of Africa, and\nengulfed in the stormy waters, never to rise again. This sorrow had told\ngreatly on Mrs. Falconer, and she had aged very much since we saw her\nlast. But she was touchingly gentle and tender to Joyce, and her\nchildren were the delight of her heart.\nJoyce's tap was answered by a sleepy \"Come in.\"\n\"We are just starting, Gratian,\" Joyce said; \"I could not go without\nbidding you good-bye, and thanking you for a very pleasant visit.\"\n\"What makes you start so early?\"\n\"Gilbert wished us to be off by ten o'clock. He says Bristol is likely\nto be in a ferment to-day, and he did not wish us to be late.\"\n\"Late! Well I should think twelve would have been time enough to start.\nBid mother and Piers good-bye for me. Is Melville down stairs?\"\n\"I have not seen him,\" Joyce said; \"but perhaps he is in the study.\"\n\"Good-bye again,\" Joyce said, stooping to kiss Gratian; \"we have had a\nvery happy fortnight. I do like my children to know the dear old place.\"\n\"We are very glad to have you,\" Gratian replied; \"and, Joyce, if you pay\na visit at any of the best houses at Clifton, or near Bristol, notice if\nthe curtains are flowered damask or watered, for new curtains we _must_\nhave in the dining room.\"\nAnother yawn, and \"Good-bye, love to Aunt Annabella,\" and Gratian's\nhead, in the many-frilled night-cap, which scarcely hid a row of\ncurl-papers, fell back upon the pillow.\nAnd now Falcon's voice was heard.\n\"Mother, _do_ come; why doesn't Aunt Gratian get up? mother! How lazy\nshe is!\"\n\"Hush! Falcon,\" for Joyce saw her brother issuing forth from his\ndressing-room in a magnificent loose dressing-gown, and a scarlet fez\nwith a tassel on his head.\n\"Why! Joyce, off already?\" he said; \"I must come down and see the last\nof the infants. Thank goodness they are not mine!\"\n\"I have been to bid Gratian good-bye, and thanked her for her kindness;\nwe are a large party.\"\n\"Oh! so much the better,\" said Melville, good-temperedly; \"we are very\nglad to have you. What a regular family coach! Where did that come\nfrom?\"\n\"From the 'Swan.' Ralph ordered it yesterday.\"\nAt last they were all packed in.\nJoyce was the last, and she was just about to step into the carriage\nwhen Mr. Paget came riding up.\n\"Oh! you are off, Mrs. Arundel. I just called to tell you that there is\nnews of disturbances in Bristol. A great mob collected in Queen's Square\nlast night, and political feeling is exciting the people to madness. I\nsuppose Arundel will ride out to meet you?\"\n\"He told me to start early, that we might get through Bristol before the\nafternoon.\"\n\"Ah! Well, I daresay it will be all right. Upon my word, what a pretty\nparty you are! A rose and her rosebuds--eh! Mrs. Falconer? Where is\nRalph?\"\n\"Gone early to Bridgwater; there is a cattle sale to-day, and he and Mr.\nWatson went off at six o'clock.\"\n\"Ralph does not let the grass grow under his feet,--eh! Falconer? It is\nthe early bird that finds the worm.\"\nMelville smiled. The gorgeous colours of his dressing gown and fez came\nout in grand relief against the old porch, and Mr. Paget thought to\nhimself, how odd it was that Mr. Falconer's son should be so entirely\nunlike either father or mother. He had dismounted; while old Thomas held\nthe horse, he had helped Joyce into the carriage, and patted the rounded\ncheeks of the baby, whom her mother now took from her grandmother, and\nsettled comfortably on her knee, while he called out to Falcon, who was\nin the dickey with Susan and the luggage, not to put out his eyes with a\nlong cane he was brandishing, kicking his feet vigorously all the time,\nand shouting \"Gee up!\" at the pitch of his young lungs. The two little\nrosebuds of girls sat demure and quiet on the back seat with their uncle\nPiers; and then, with a final \"Good-bye\" and waving his hands, the\nscarlet-coated post-boy cracked his whip, and Joyce and her children\nwere fairly off for home; for, sweet as the old home was, and full of\ntender memories, the large city house in Great George Street was dearer",

No one would want to steal her\nchildren; there is enough of that article in the world and to spare,\nwithout taking other people's.\"\nHarry was nevertheless uneasy.\nThe unsettled condition of the whole district was becoming daily more\nserious. The popular cry in Bristol only the year before had been for\nSir Charles Wetherall, and no Popery!\nThe people who went out to meet him when he came to open the assize, had\ncheered and applauded him, trying to take the horses out of the carriage\nand drag him into the city in triumph. But now a change had come over\nthe mind of the people, and the Reform Bill was exciting them to frenzy\nand hatred of every man who opposed it, of whom their once idolized\nRecorder was one of the most prominent.\nAs we look back over the half century which lies between our own days\nand those of the great riots in the ancient city of Bristol, it is\nstrange to mark how the questions, then so furiously contested, are now\nsettled; how the pendulum, then swinging so violently, has subsided into\na more regular beat; how even the second Reform Bill, carried by a large\nmajority, is now a thing of the past; how the exclusion of any one from\nholding office, parliamentary or social, on the ground of religion, is\nnow considered an act of tyrannical, and ill-judged interference,\nbetween the conscience of a man, and his duty to God.\nThese fifty years, full of the great events so strongly marked by the\ndiscoveries of science, are full also of lessons, which we do well to\nponder. They seem to take the text and preach patience to those who are\nhot-headed, and eager to press on any reform, or to advocate, with\nintemperate zeal, any scheme, even though they honestly believe it is\nfor the good of the people.\nThe wise advice of the Poet Laureate seems worthy to be followed at this\nvery moment, when the kingdom is, from one end to the other, vibrating\nwith the burning questions which shall decide the success, or\nnon-success, of the two great parties which divide the nation:\n\"Have patience--ourselves are full\nOf social wrong; and maybe wildest dreams\nAre but the needful preludes of the truth.\nThis fine old world of ours is but a child\nYet in the go-cart. _Patience!_ Give it time\nTo learn its limbs--there is _a Hand that guides_.\"\nThe carriage containing the happy mother and her children went merrily\non its way to Bristol.",

      "text": "The first glory of the spring was reigning everywhere. The hedgerows\nwere full of starry primroses, and the copses carpeted with bluebells.\nFair companies of wind flowers quivered in the gentle breeze, and the\nvariety of foliage in the woods was almost as great as in autumn. Every\nshade of green shone in the sunlight, from silvery birch to emerald\nlime, sober elm, and russet oak, with the young tassels hanging on the\nbirch, and the contrasting sombre dark hue of the pines, clothing the\nwoods with surpassing beauty.\nThe baby, lulled by the motion of the carriage and the regular sound of\nthe horses' hoofs, was soon in profound slumber. Little Lota and\nLettice, who bore the names of the aunt and niece in the Vicar's Close,\nafter taking some buns from their grandmother's well-filled basket, also\nsubsided into sleep. Lota was taken by her grandmother, and Lettice,\nwith the support of Piers' arm, had a comfortable nap. Only Falcon, in\nthe \"dickey\" behind, was wide awake. He was a noble-looking boy of five\nyears old, with fresh, blue eyes and a fair complexion. He was like his\nmother in features, and his grandfather in his stout, athletic build. He\nhad a loud, childish voice, and, as he whipped the back of the carriage,\nhe sang lustily, in a sort of monotone, which kept time with the horses'\nfeet:\n\"Home--home--home to father.\"\nHis mother heard the words, and they found an echo in her heart of\n\"Home--home to Gilbert.\"\nJoyce's girlish loveliness had developed into the matured beauty of the\nmother, which is always so attractive. Her face shone with that soft\nlight of motherhood and happy wifehood which we look for in vain on many\nfaces which are beautiful, but _lack_ something. Her own mother\nacknowledged the charm, and often thought how much dearer and more\nbeautiful Joyce had become in her eyes since her marriage, and how the\nfather who had loved her so dearly would have rejoiced to see her now.\nThis thought was in her mind when Joyce said:\n\"Is not Lota too heavy for you, mother? Shall we change? Let me give you\nbaby.\"\n\"No, dear, no; it would be a pity to wake the baby; how sweet she looks.\nThere will never be any children in the old home now, I am afraid.\" And\nMrs. Falconer sighed.\n\"I don't think they are wanted,\" Joyce said; \"but perhaps till people\nhave babies they don't know how delightful they are. Piers is laughing\nat me.\"\n\"Not at you. I was only thinking how Gratian and Melville would hate the\nbother of children about the house.\"\n\"They were very kind to us,\" Joyce said. \"It seems to me that we may be\nvery thankful Melville married Gratian.\"\n\"Yes, she keeps him in good order.\"\nMrs. Falconer had still a weak, very weak, place in her heart for\nMelville, and she said, sharply:\n\"That's not a becoming way to speak of your eldest brother.\"\nPiers shrugged his shoulders. He took in, more fully than his mother\ncould, the trouble that Melville's conduct had brought upon them all,\nespecially on Ralph--Ralph, who might have done so well in scholarship,\nnow acting as steward to his brother, with less thanks and less pay than\nhe deserved. It irritated Piers to see Melville's self-satisfaction, and\nto know that from sheer indolence, if Ralph had not come to the rescue,\nhe would have brought the inheritance of his fathers to hopeless ruin.\nMelville had his wish now. Gratian took care that their position should\nbe recognised, and they visited at the houses of the neighbouring\ngentry, where Gratian's ready tact, and powers of fascination, were\nacknowledged. It became the fashion to enliven a dull, heavy dinner by\ninviting Mrs. Melville Falconer, who could tell amusing stories,\nseasoned with French phrases, and listen with apparently deep interest\nto the stories other people told, whether they related to the weather,\nthe crops, or the fashions.\nJoyce saw the cloud on Piers' face, and hastened to say that Ralph had\nwritten a very clever treatise on draining land, and that Gilbert\nthought it would draw people's attention to the subject, from the\nmasterly way in which it was treated.\n\"So Ralph's brains are of great use, after all;\" she said.\n\"He is thrown away at Fair Acres. Harry says so, and I don't think it is\nfair or just. I never could get over Melville's horrid selfishness, and\nI don't wish to get over it.\"\n\"Piers!\" Joyce said, reproachfully; \"remember he is your brother.\"\n\"We have all good cause to remember it,\" was the muttered rejoinder.\nAnd now, as they passed through the villages nearer Bristol, large knots\nof people were congregated here and there. Some stared at the carriage\nas they passed, some hissed, and angry voices cried:\n\"No Popery!\" and \"Reform!\"\nWhen within some four miles of the city, Susan Priday leaned over and\nsaid:\n\"There is a great crowd coming on behind us, ma'am; they look a very\nrough lot.\"\nThe carriage was going up a steep hill, and just as it had slowly\nreached the top, some fifty or sixty men came out from a lane, which\nturned off towards Bath, and called out to the post-boy to stop.\nThey were fierce, wild-looking men, and, as the post-boy tried to take\nno notice and whip on his horses, the bridles were seized and the\ncarriage was surrounded.\nThen a number of voices shouted--\n\"Reform! Reform! Are ye for Reform? you grand folks; if ye are, speak\nout!\"\n\"Let go the horses' heads!\" said Piers. \"Let go! How dare you obstruct\nthe high road?\"\n\"Aye! aye! you young fool; we'll teach you manners!\" and one of the men\nclenched his fist and shook it at Piers. In another moment the crowd\nfrom behind, which Susan Priday had seen, came breathlessly up the hill,\nwomen with children in their arms, all screaming, at the top of their\nvoices, \"Reform! Reform!\"\nOne woman held up a child with a pinched, wan face, and said--\n\"You rich folks, you'd trample on us if you could, and we are starving!\nLook here!\" and she bared the legs of the poor emaciated baby. \"Look\nhere! Look at your fat, stuffed-out childer, and look at _this_!\"\n\"Look 'ee here, missus; we are a-going to Bristol to cry for Reform. If\nyou say you will have nothing to do with the tyrant, Wetherall, and his\ncursed lot, you may go on. If not, we'll seize the carriage, we'll turn\nye all out into the road, and we'll drive in state to the big meeting in\nQueen's Square! My! what a lark that will be!\"\n\"Listen,\" Joyce said, standing up in the carriage with her child in her\narms; \"I am on my way home with these little children. Surely you will\nnot stop me and endanger their lives?\"\n\"We will! we will! if you don't give us your word you are for Reform and\ndead against Wetherall.\"\n\"Why,\" Joyce said fearlessly, \"only a year ago, and near this very\nplace, the men and women of Bristol shouted, 'Long live Wetherall!' And\nnow!\"\n\"Now we say, _curse_ him!\" growled a big, brawny man.\nThe little girls, awakened by the uproar, began to cry with fear, and\nFalcon called out, \"Let mother go on, you bad men! I say, let her go on!\nFather will be so angry with you!\"\n\"Hush! hush! dear Master Falcon,\" Susan said; \"you will only make them\nworse. Hush!\"\nAnd now, as Joyce looked over the faces crowding round her, she beckoned\nto the woman, who had been thrust back by the pressure of others who\nwanted to see the inhabitants of the carriage.\n\"Come here,\" she said, holding out some of the buns; \"I am so sorry for\nyour hungry baby. Give her one of these buns, and do believe me when I\nsay I am sorry for all your troubles.\"\nThe sweet, ringing voice began to have effect, and the clamour ceased.\n\"I am no enemy of the poor. My husband and I wish to do what we can for\nyou, and I believe, nay, I know, he is an advocate of Reform, but not\nfor rebellion against authority, and violence.\"\nThe execrations were changed now to cheers.\n\"Let 'em pass, she is a good 'un; let 'em pass, she has a kind heart;\nshe has a pretty face, too. Here,\" said a man, \"I am the father of that\npoor babby; shake hands, missus.\"\nJoyce stretched out her hand at once, and it was taken in a strong grip.\n\"Thank you,\" she said; \"I knew you would not be cruel to my little\nchildren. Will you all remember that I ask you to be peaceable, and to\npray to God to help you and give you bread for your children. He is a\nkind and loving Father; don't forget that.\"\nAs Joyce stood before that seething crowd of strange, wan faces, for\nmany of them bore too plainly the marks of fasting and hunger, the baby\nin her arms raised a pitiful cry, and she pressed it closer and soothed\nit, while the baby lifted its little hand and stroked its mother's face.\n\"Aye, she is of the right sort,\" they cried; \"she is a mother who loves\nher child. She ain't too grand to cosset her babby. Let her go on!\"\nThe post-boy cracked his whip, and the carriage was just starting, when",

Hold Falcon firmly when we get into the streets.\"\n\"I shall be glad to get home now,\" said little Falcon. \"I am as tired as\nmother is.\"\nThat surging crowd, increasing hourly in numbers and in vehemence,\nthronged the narrow streets, and made the progress of the carriage very\nslow.\nThe young man who rode before it attracted attention, and he was called\nupon several times to declare whether he would vote for Protheroe and\nBaillie, and whether he was an anti-reformer or a reformer.\nThese questions were generally shouted at him and followed by cries and\ncheers, so that the reply could not be heard.\nErect and fearless, Gilbert rode on, clearing the way for the carriage,\nwhich contained all that was most precious to him in the world. Had he\nturned a hair, or shown the slightest sign of fear, it is probable he\nwould have had stones hurled at him, or insulting missives, such as\nrotten eggs or dead rats, thrown into the carriage.

I am afraid you have been a\ngood deal frightened, my darling; but cheer up now; the danger, if there\nwas any, is over, thank God!\"\n\"Gilbert, it was not the crowd, it was not the fear about the poor\npeople who stopped the carriage, it was that amongst those dreadful\nfaces I saw Bob Priday's, the man who stopped us on Mendip years ago,\nand who, as we think, killed dear father. Oh, it was the sight of his\nface which was too much for me! And poor Susan saw him also. It brought\nit all back.

Gilbert,\" she said, rallying, \"it is so delightful to be\nat home with you again. While we have each other nothing can be _very_\nbad, can it?\"\n\"Nothing,\" he said, fervently. \"And now, while you are resting, I must\ngo down to the office, for my partner is at the meeting at the \"White\nLion,\" helping to bolster up poor Hart-Davies to fight the Tories'\nbattle. He is a good fellow, and everybody respects him; but the truth\nis, the tide is too strong in Bristol now for any but some very\nexceptional man to battle against it.\"\n\"You think the Whigs will carry the election?\"\n\"Without a doubt.\"\n\"Are you going to the meeting in Queen's Square?\"\n\"I think not. We cannot both leave the office at once, and I do not\ngreatly care about it. I do increasingly feel that these men who clamour\nfor their cause injure it. They are exciting the mob in Bristol--always\ninflammable material--and this fury of rage against old Wetherall is\nmost dangerous. Everyone expects that if he attempts to open the next\nassize there will be a riot it will be difficult to quell.

Well, well, patience is the great lesson for us\nall to learn, the patience that God has with us.

The Bristol clocks had\nstruck eleven; and from time to time the noise of the voices of many\npeople reached her, borne upon the still night air. She had sent the\nservants to bed; and Mrs. Arundel and Charlotte were also gone to their\nrooms; but Joyce sat up watching for Gilbert's return.\nThe baby Joy, was sleeping in her cradle, and Lettice and Lota in their\ncribs, while Falcon lay in profound repose, a fife, upon which he had\nbeen playing hard all day, as he marched round and round the garden, was\nclasped in his strong, round little fingers.\nJoyce bent over the children, shading the candle with her hand, to\nassure herself they slept, and then, leaving the nursery door open, that\nshe might hear if they stirred or cried, she went gently down the wide\nstaircase to the hall. The fire in the dining-room was burning low, and\nshe put on some more coal, and saw that the kettle just simmered on the\nhob, ready to be put on to the fire when Gilbert came.\nShe moved with that quiet, almost stealthy tread, which is common with\nthose who feel themselves the only persons awake in a house.\nThe stillness was broken by the ticking of the clock in the hall, and\nhow loud that tick sounded!\nJoyce went to the window, and, unfastening the shutter, looked out into\nthe night, a dark, murky night; and from below came the low murmur of\nthe crowds, which had not yet dispersed.\nPublic feeling throughout the country had reached almost to fever heat,\nbut in Bristol the animosity against Bishops and Lords, for the\nrejection of the Reform Bill which the Commons had passed, was quickened\nby the personal hatred, which the recorder, Sir Charles Wetherall had\nexcited amongst the people.\nBristol reformers were enraged that he should have made a bitter attack\nupon Lord John Russell in the House of Commons, charging him most\nunfairly with encouraging illegal means for carrying the Reform Bill.\nThough the whole country was in a ferment, and riots had broken out in\nDerby, Nottingham, and other towns, in no place was there such a\npersonal feeling excited as against the Recorder of Bristol.\nThe assizes would soon open, and vengeance was vowed against him, if he\nattempted to enter the city to perform his duties as a judge.\nBoth parties vied with each other in exciting bitterness and ill\nfeeling; and all good, moderate men felt, in their own minds, that a\ncrisis was at hand, and that, unless some wise and able pilot could be\nfound to guide the helm, a most disastrous shipwreck must follow.",

Gilbert had spoken several times at\nsome of the smaller meetings, and had advised temperance and patience.\nHe was one of the very few, in those days, who appealed to the working\nmen to help to maintain order among themselves; who showed the ruin and\ndistress the rioters had brought upon their families in other places,\nand who spoke to them as having common cause with himself to do all they\ncould to protect their wives and children. Gilbert was, in his heart,\nwhat was called a whig, but he was far, indeed, from being a hot-headed\nradical.\nThat he was known to be the grandson of a peer, and that his mother had\na title, did not win him favour with the extreme section of his own\nparty, while the others, perhaps, were a little triumphant that the son\nof a noble house might yet question the wisdom of the Lords in rejecting\na Bill which was so dear to the heart of the people.\nJoyce gently closed the shutters and returned to her place by the fire.\nThen she went out into the hall, where an oil lamp was dimly burning,\nand looked out from a small window by the side of the door.\nA sense of fear began to creep over her, not for herself, but for\nGilbert. She listened for his step with that nervous tension which is so\npainful, and of which we all know something.\nPresently the door of the cellar, which opened into the hall, creaked;\nJoyce watched it breathlessly; it opened wider and wider, and a man's\nhead appeared. In the dim light she could scarcely discern the features,\nbut something in that face was surely familiar.\nShe was not left long in doubt; once more Bob Friday stood before her.\nAt first Joyce was literally paralysed with terror, and she could\nneither speak, nor call for help.\nShe made a movement towards the door, but the man raised a hand to\nprevent her.\n\"Don't you scream or move. I want to speak to you.\"\n\"How can you--how dare you, come here?\"\n\"I came to tell ye that I'll see your young gent comes to no harm.\"\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Joyce, burying her face for a moment\nin her hands. \"I know--I know what terrible grief you once brought on me\nand all I loved.\"\nThe accents of her voice, with the sorrowful ring in them, the quiet\nself-possession, for which, with a sinking heart she struggled, touched\nthat rough, bad man, as no protestations or entreaties could have done.\n\"I cannot believe,\" she went on, \"you are come to do me more harm. My\nfour little children are asleep upstairs. There is no one in the house\nbut women, helpless women, one of whom is your own daughter--your _own\ndaughter_.\"\n\"I wouldn't hurt a hair of her head, nor yours, nor your childer's. I\ncame to warn you--the folks down below will stop at nothing once they\nare let loose; they'd as soon tear your young gent to pieces as look at\n'im. They'd fire this 'ouse for a trifle. I belong to a party of 'em,\nand if I know it, _he_ shan't come to no harm. Look ye, missus, I wanted\nto see you, to tell you the squire was riding peaceable enough----\"\n\"Oh! don't! don't! I cannot bear it,\" Joyce said.\n\"He was riding peaceable enough, and I laid in wait for 'im. I got hold\nof the bridle, and the horse, she backed and reared, and the squire he\nfell on a sharp stone, which cut his forehead--a three corner cut--I see\nit now. He lay like a dog, dead, and the horse galloped off, and\nI--well, I made off too, and got aboard a ship in Bristol Docks, and\nonly came back last Christmas. I meant to threaten the squire; but I\ndidn't kill 'im; I didn't _want_ to kill 'im.\"\n\"Your act killed him as much as if you had thrown the stone, as we all\nbelieved you did. Oh! I pray God may forgive you.\"\n\"Say you forgive me,\" the man muttered; \"I wouldn't hurt a hair of your\nhead.\"\n\"I pray God to forgive you, and I try to do as the Lord Jesus would have\nme, and forgive you. But, oh! leave your evil ways, and turn to Him.\"\n\"It's too late,\" he said.\n\"Oh! no! no!--never! never too late!\"\nThe man was silent for a few minutes; then he spoke in a low harsh\nvoice:\n\"Give my love to poor Sue. I broke her mother's heart, and I nearly\nbroke her's. I saw her riding in the carriage with you, like a lady, in\nthe spring.

What can have happened?\"\nHe carried her, half fainting, into the dining room, and chafed her cold\nhands, and held some water to her lips.\nA great flood of tears relieved her at last, and then clinging to her\nhusband's neck, and still shuddering in every limb, she managed to tell\nhim the story of Bob Priday's visit.\n\"It is a very grave matter,\" Gilbert said; \"if the man who is guilty of\nyour father's death is in Bristol, he ought to be apprehended and put on\nhis trial.\"\n\"He seems to bear us no ill-will now, Gilbert. He is penitent, I think;\nand he said dear father fell from the horse, and that he did not\nactually throw the stone at him. Oh! Gilbert, it seems to bring it all\nback again.\"\n\"Dismiss it from your thoughts to-night, my darling, we shall need all\nour strength and courage. I am sworn in as a special constable. The\npeople show increasingly signs of ill-will against those in authority.\nIf Wetherall persists in making a public entry into Bristol next week,\nGod only knows what will be the consequences. No one seems to be able to\ntake active measures. The mayor is kindly and well-intentioned, but he\nhas no strength of purpose, and if once the mob gets the upper hand,\nand those in authority are frightened, there will be a riot such as\nBristol has never known. I think, if things do not look more promising,\nI must send you to Abbot's Leigh with my mother and the babies, and\nCharlotte Benson had better go home. There is a house at Abbots Leigh,\nBenson, my partner, will let me have, and you would be out of harm's way\nthere.\"\n\"Oh! Gilbert, surely you do not mean that I am to leave you? I could\nnot--I will not leave you!\"\n\"You will do what I think is best and right, like a brave, good wife.\nYou would not add to my anxiety, I am sure. I have seen enough in\nBristol to-day to feel certain there will be a desperate struggle before\nthe city quiets down. Only imagine that man, Captain Claxton, being so\nmad as to call a meeting of sailors on board the two ships now in the\nharbour, the 'Charles' and the 'Earl of Liverpool,' under pretence of\nvoting a loyal address to the king, but really to get the sailors to\nform a guard to protect Wetherall when he enters Bristol. Could anything\nbe more likely to enrage the other party? The meeting was broken up and\nadjourned to the quay, where the anti-reformers passed the resolution in\na great uproar, protesting loyalty to the king, but declaring they will\nnot be made a cat's paw of by the corporation and paid agents. The\nnotion of protesting this publicly in the face of all the orders of the\nmayor! They are going to send a deputation to Wetherall to beg him not\nto persist in coming in next Saturday; but I am afraid it will be\nuseless. If anything could have added to my own share in the troubles of\nthe city, it is that Maythorne has chosen this time to come to the hotel\nin Clifton. He is a mere wreck, and so broken down that he looks like an\nold man instead of in his prime, but he is as bumptious as ever.\"\nJoyce had roused herself now. The idea of Gilbert's danger was enough to\ndrive away every other anxiety.\nShe made him take the refreshment which he so greatly needed, and,\nthough pale and exhausted, she felt it almost a relief to busy herself\nin any way which diverted her mind from the terrible half-hour she had\ngone through in the hall face to face with Bob Priday.\n\"Why is Maythorne's coming so vexatious to you?\" she asked; \"I mean,\nmore vexatious than usual.\"\n\"My dear child,\" Gilbert said, \"the very fact of his title, and my\nconnection with it, would be enough to ensure brickbats and stones to\nbe hurled at my head if he is seen with me. Let us hope he will keep to\nthe more aristocratic quarters of Clifton, and not come near us.\"\n\"I think,\" Joyce said, when at last they prepared to go upstairs to bed;\n\"I think I should like to hear you give God thanks for my safety, and\nthat strength was given me not to cry out or scream; but oh! Gilbert,\nGilbert, I _was_ so frightened!\"\nAgain he soothed her and comforted her, and then he raised his voice,\nthe manly tones touched with pathos, and thanked God for His mercy,\ncommitting his wife and her little children to His care.",

He took a\nvery lofty standpoint, and vowed that the Recorder was a fine fellow and\ndid what was right, and that he should like to see sacks full of the\nmalcontents thrown into the Float as an easy way of getting rid of them.\nGilbert found silence his safest course with his uncle, and tried to put\na restraint on himself when in his presence. He came up from Bristol\nabout four o'clock in the afternoon of this memorable Saturday, weary\nand dispirited, and found, to his dismay, that his uncle was in the\ndrawing-room.\nHe was lounging on a sofa, holding a skein of silk for Charlotte\nBenson's embroidery, affecting, at forty, the airs and manners of a\nyoung beau, and talking an immense deal of nonsense to poor Charlotte,\nwhich she was only too ready to drink in.\nCharlotte had begged to remain in Bristol at the early part of the week;\nand, as the days passed on, it became more and more difficult to think\nof leaving it. The mail coaches and passenger vans, as well as private\ncarriages, were continually stopped, and the travellers were roughly\nasked whether they were for Reform, or against it; for the Lords, or\nready to cry \"_Down with the Lords!_\"\nIn many instances quiet people, who cared very little about politics,\nand understood less, were seriously frightened, and even injured by the\nswift hurling of a stone or a brickbat.\nAs soon as Joyce heard her husband's step, she ran out to the hall.\nSusan Priday was also on the look-out, with Joy in her arms.\nGilbert looked worn out, and threw himself into a chair, saying:\n\"I believe it is all but impossible to avoid a riot now. I wish you and\nthe children and my mother were safe at Abbot's Leigh. Indeed, it is\nnot too late now to get you up to Down Cottage, and----\"\n[Illustration: High Street, Bristol.]\n\"I cannot leave you, Gilbert; do not ask me,\" Joyce said.\n\"Tell us what has happened in Bristol. We hear the uproar from these\nwindows,\" his mother said.\n\"Oh! let them fight it out,\" said Lord Maythorne, \"let them fight it\nout. They won't touch us.\"\n\"I am not so sure of that,\" said Gilbert, sharply. \"I have a suspicion\nthat you, for one, would get rough handling if some of the malcontents\ncaught you.\"\nLord Maythorne laughed. \"I should like to see them try. But tell us the\nnews, pray.\"\n\"The news is,\" said Gilbert, \"that the plan of bringing in the Recorder\nearly in the day failed. We marched out about ten o'clock to Totterdown,\nin the hope of cheating the mob, who did not expect the procession till\nfour o'clock. The yells and hisses of two thousand people were a\nsufficient proof of this. The sheriff's carriage could scarcely make its\nway through the masses of people, and several stones were hurled at it.\nSir Charles Wetherall reached the Guildhall about twelve o'clock, and\nthe commission was read. It might have passed off fairly, had not that\nstupid though well meaning fellow, Ludlow, began to allude to Reform. It\nwas like a spark to tinder, and there was an instant uproar; amidst it\nthe court adjourned to eight o'clock on Monday morning. Every one means\nwell; but there is no leader for our body of special constables, and\nsome of the paid fellows are worse than useless. The Recorder is now at\nthe Mansion House in Queen's Square, and we were ordered to rest, but\nnot before several of our number were a good deal hurt, and in every\nencounter the mob had the best of it. They have armed themselves with\nsticks, and one poor fellow was chased into the Float, and many more\nmust have been hurt.\"\n\"Are you hurt, Gilbert?\"\n\"A few bruises, nothing worse; but it is imperative that the children\nand Susan should go up to Clifton Down. We are too near the city; if the\nMansion House is fired, as we hear is likely, the uproar and confusion\nwill reach this house. Charlotte and you, mother, the children and\nJoyce, must prepare to start at once. Make haste and pack up a few\nthings, and I will see you to a place of safety.\"\nAnd now swift steps were heard on the stairs, and Falcon came in.\n\"Father,\" he said, \"I've been watching from the windows, and I can see\nthe crowd, and the shouts get louder.\"\n\"You are to go with Susan, Grannie, and cousin Charlotte, at once, to\nDown Cottage. You will take care of mother, won't you, Falcon?\"\n\"Of course I will,\" the boy said, \"and of the baby, and Susan. Susan\ndoes nothing but cry. I wish she would not.\"\n\"It is not the time to cry, Falcon. We must all be as brave as we can.\nNow, Joyce,\" he said, \"and Charlotte, make haste.\"\n\"You are in a desperate hurry,\" Lord Maythorne exclaimed. \"I will look\nafter the ladies with pleasure, and I confess I see no great cause of\nalarm. You forget, Gilbert, that people have nerves.\"\nFor Charlotte began to sob hysterically, and ask 'if they would all be\nburned up, and if the dreadful people would rush up the hill.'\nLord Maythorne soothed her with honeyed words, and declared he would not\nleave her till she was in a place of safety.",

Nay, Gilbert, do not refuse me.\"\n\"Well, I will yield for this one night, and to-morrow, being Sunday,\nthere may be peace; but I doubt it.

He had again taken up his post at the open nursery windows, leaning\nover the bars, and listening to the ever increasing tumult which reigned\nin the city below.\n\"Oh! dear madam,\" Susan said; \"I don't like to leave you.\"\n\"You like to please me, Susan, and there is no danger for me.\"\n\"The cellar window is made fast, I know,\" Susan said, \"and he--he can\nnever come near you again; but suppose the mob should come up here, and\nmaster not be able to reach you.\"\n\"That is not likely; by to-morrow all may be quiet, and I shall come to\nDown Cottage to see how you have got on.

Now then, darlings, run\ndown and tell father you are ready, while I go and see if grandmother\nand Mary, and cousin Charlotte are ready also.\"\nBut Mrs. Arundel had determined to remain with Joyce, and said nothing\nshould tempt her to leave her; her maid Mary should go, and she would\nstay behind.\nJoyce thought of the rather small accommodation at Down Cottage, and did\nnot raise any further objection. There was only Charlotte now to hasten.\nJoyce found her tying her bonnet and arranging her curls under it, and\nturning her head first to one side, then to the other, to catch a\nglimpse of her profile in the glass.\n\"Come, Charlotte, make haste,\" Joyce said; \"they are all ready.\"\n\"Is Lord Maythorne coming with us?\"\n\"Yes, as far as the Hotel. If I were you I should not desire his\ncompany.\"\n\"Oh! Joyce, he is very nice, quite delightful, and he is--\"\n\"He is given to flatter everybody,\" Joyce said, \"as years ago poor\nMelville found to his cost. So take care, Charlotte.\"\n\"Take care, indeed! I don't know what you mean,\" said Charlotte,\npouting. \"You always think no one can possibly admire _me_.\"\n\"My dear Charlotte, this is not a time for such nonsense, it is time to\ncommend ourselves and all we love to God's care, and not to be filled\nwith thoughts of who admires us and who does not. Lord Maythorne is\nGilbert's uncle; but he has caused a great deal of sorrow in the family,\nand we were all very sorry when he came to live in England again. Mrs.\nArundel cannot be uncivil to him, but she has not the slightest respect\nfor him; neither have I.\"\n\"Well, dear,\" said Charlotte, \"now you have finished your lecture, I\nwill go downstairs. I suppose you think, as you are--are married, you\nmay----\"\nCharlotte's ready tears began to flow, and Joyce, losing her patience,\npassed by her quickly, and ran down into the hall.\nIt was hard to bid them all \"good-bye,\" her baby smiling at her from\nunder her warm hood, Lettice and Lota clinging to her, and Susan looking\nback to the last moment, as she led the way down Great George Street\nwith Joy in her arms.\n\"You must give Uncle Piers my love, you know,\" Joyce said, \"and say I am\ncoming to-morrow. Good-bye; good-bye.\"\nShe stood at the door watching her husband and children down the street,\nwhich opens into Park Street, kissing her hand to them as the little\ngirls' figures disappeared round the corner.\nLord Maythorne and Charlotte were rather longer in setting out, and a\ngreat deal of hesitation on Charlotte's part, and coaxing on Lord\nMaythorne's, was necessary, before they too at last departed.

When will the master be\nback, ma'am?\"\n\"I don't know quite. Yes,\" she said, \"this door is safe; and I wonder\nhow anyone could have climbed that wall?\"\nHenry looked curiously at her.\n\"Somebody _did_ climb it,\" he said, \"for I found great footmarks here a\nweek ago, and showed 'em to the master.\"\nJoyce knew well enough whose footprints they were, but she said nothing.\n\"I should like you to come into the cellar with me, Henry,\" she said,\nturning to retrace her steps; and Falcon shouted from his watch-tower:\n\"They are making a greater noise than ever, mother, and I see such lots\nand lots of people on the quay. Come up, mother.\"\n\"I am coming very soon, dear,\" she said.\nThen Joyce finished her inspection of the cellar, not without a thrill\nof remembered fear as she heard the creaking of the door, as it closed\nbehind her.\n\"You had better stay in the kitchen with cook, Henry, and be on the\nwatch till your master's return. He may not be home till very late, for\nthe special constables are on duty; but what an increasing noise! What\ncan be going on now?\"\n\"They'll tear the Recorder limb from limb if they catch him; they are\njust like wild beasts in their rage against him. Lor! what a pity it is\nto meddle; let 'em have reform if they like, or leave it alone, it's no\nodds to me, nor thousands of other folk. It is a great ado about\nnothing; what will be, will be, and there's an end of it.\"\nThese opinions of Gilbert Arundel's gardener were decidedly safe, and\nhad they been held by the mass of the Bristol people, the ensuing scenes\nof strife, fire, and bloodshed, would have been spared. But all men are\nnot of the same easy, philosophical temperament!\nAnd, doubtless, the stirring of the waters has a salutary effect, though\nthe storm that smote them may be fearful. We who have lived to see a\nsecond Reform Bill carried, and religious tolerance everywhere a\nrecognised principle, are perhaps scarcely as thankful as we ought to be\nfor all the struggles, which have, by God's help and guidance, ended\nwell for this people and nation.\nHe maketh the storm to cease; \"He sitteth above the water-floods; yea,\nthe Lord remaineth a King for ever.\"\n[Illustration]",

They tore up the iron\nrailings in front of the Mansion House, and hooted and scoffed at the\nRiot Act, which was read by the Mayor's order, and the force of special\nconstables was quite insufficient.\nGilbert saw this at once, and now, when the cry arose: \"Fire the Mansion\nHouse!\" it was a relief to see some action taken, by a troop of the 14th\nLight Dragoons, and Dragoon Guards trotting into the Square.\nThere was to all noble-hearted men, something terribly humiliating in\nthe aspect of affairs. Here was a seething, ignorant crowd of men,\nwomen, and boys, intimidating the magistrates, frightening the Mayor\ntill he actually barricaded his windows in the Mansion House with his\nbed; and Sir Charles Wetherall beating an undignified retreat from the\nflat roof of the dining-room. There, helped by a woman's hand, who set\nup a ladder for him, he dropped in pitiable terror into the stables\nbehind, and hid in a loft. Gilbert, standing on guard by the corner of\nthe Square with four friends bravely holding their ground, and warding\noff with their staves the excited crowd, recognised in the dim light the\nRecorder slipping by, in a post-boy's dress, which actually passed him\nthrough the crowd, till he found himself safe at Kingsdown. And if the\ncowardice of the Recorder, in escaping for dear life from the storm he\nhad himself roused was unprecedented, the wavering uncertainty of the\nColonel in command of the troops was scarcely less reprehensible!\nHow Gilbert longed to take a prominent part, and how his heart burned\nwith righteous indignation against the weakness and incapacity of those\nin command.",

Dear father has\nbeen hurt by the rioters, and is to lie in bed very quiet all day. I\nwant to go up to Clifton to see the baby Joy, and Lettice and Lota. I\nshall leave you to watch by father, and if he stirs or wakes, call\ngrandmamma. Will you do this?\"\n\"Yes, mother,\" the boy said. Then with a sigh, \"I hope the riots are\nover now. At first I liked to hear the noise, and watch the crowd, but I\ngot tired of it. Are we to go to church, mother?\"\n\"If I can get back in time, darling, you shall go to church with Mary,\nbut I don't think I shall go to-day.\"\nThen she gave Falcon his basin of bread and milk, moving so gently that\nno one heard her lighting the nursery fire, and performing with her\naccustomed nicety all the little household duties which had been\nfamiliar to her from early childhood. Then she shared Falcon's breakfast\nwith him, gave him a volume of the old \"Children's Friend,\" with the\nfunny little woodcuts, which were the delight of the children of fifty\nyears ago; and, establishing him in the window-seat in his father's\nroom, left him on guard. It was beautiful to see how the noisy,\nhigh-spirited child, responded to his mother's hand, and felt a proud\nsense of serving her, as he was left in the room to take care of his\nfather.\nThe clocks were chiming a quarter to eight as Joyce reached Park Street,\nwhere all was quiet, but she heard several passers by, say that Queen's\nSquare was again thronged, and that the \"roughs\" were forcing their way\nback to the scene of the previous day's disturbances.\nBy the turn to Berkley Square, Joyce met Mr. Bengough, who was hurrying\ndown to the Guildhall, where, he said, Major Mackworth was attempting to\norganise the special constables; but that Colonel Brereton's folly in\nremoving his troops to the Leigh stables, had given the mob every\nencouragement.\n\"You may be glad, Mrs. Arundel, that your husband is out of the fray;\nthere will be more broken heads before midnight, I expect.\"\n\"I trust and pray, you may be kept safely. Come in, later in the day,\nand let us hear,\" Joyce said, as she parted from Mr. Bengough and walked\nquickly towards Clifton. All was quiet there, and when Joyce arrived at\nDown Cottage, her two little girls came flying to meet her, looking like\ntwo daisies, fresh from their morning bath.\nJoyce was struck with her mother's admirable management. She was always\nup with the lark in her old home at Fair Acres, and she kept up her\ncountry habits.\nThe breakfast was ready in the little dining-room, and everyone was\nthere but Charlotte. Piers had the baby Joy, upon his knee, and Mrs.\nFalcon declared she had been as \"good as gold\" all night.\nIt was hard to believe that Clifton Down Cottage could be so near to the\ntumultuous city; everything seemed going on as it did every day, and no\none appeared excited or troubled. When Joyce had told her story of the\nprevious night, however, the real state of affairs seemed brought home\nto the little party, and Lota said:\n\"I want to go home to kiss father, and make his head well.\"\nPresently Joyce said she must see Susan, and she asked Piers to come\nwith her for a moment into his own room.\nPiers delivered the baby to her grandmother, and, taking up his\ncrutches, followed Joyce. In the passage they met Charlotte.\n\"How early you have come,\" she said. \"I was called so early, as Mrs.\nFalconer wanted the rooms to be made tidy; but really I was not fit to\nget up at all. I am so dreadfully upset by yesterday's events.\"\n\"Joyce has more reason to be upset, as you call it,\" Piers said, \"than\nyou have, with Gilbert laid up with a blow on his head.\"\n\"Oh! how _dreadful_! how shocking! dearest Joyce; what _can_ I do?\"\n\"Nothing; but go and have your breakfast; mother hates having the things\nkept on the table.\"\n\"I have no patience with her,\" Piers said, wrathfully, as he closed the\ndoor of his den behind him and his sister; \"I do verily believe she\nthinks she is going to be Lady Maythorne, I do indeed.\"\n\"Oh! Piers, impossible! she cannot be so foolish.\"\n\"My dear, it would be a long plumb-line to sound her folly, or his\neither.\"\n\"But he is in difficulties as to money; he came here because he wanted\nto get some out of his sister.\"\n\"Has Aunt Letitia any money?\" Piers asked.\n\"Of course, she has her own income, and----\"\n\"Will leave it all to Charlotte. Now do you see?\"\n\"I see what you mean, but it must be prevented, it is too preposterous.\"\n\"But now, Piers, dear Piers, I want to ask your advice. I could not\ntrouble Gilbert, he is very much hurt,\" and Joyce's voice faltered. \"The\nman who saved Gilbert's life is Susan's father, Bob Priday.\"\nPiers made a gesture of astonishment. \"The man who took our father's\nlife,\" he murmured.\n\"Indirectly, not intentionally quite, as we always thought. Piers, I\nshould like to go to the Infirmary, and take Susan with me. Will you\nhelp us, and come with us?\"\n\"You may get into another scrimmage, Joyce; is it right?\"\n\"I think it is right,\" Joyce said, gently; \"I asked God about it, you\nknow.\"\nHere was Joyce's sense of strength in weakness; she had always a refuge\nand a Councillor at hand. Her religion was not one of many words; it was\nemphatically the religion of Peace--and in quietness and confidence she\ncould rest.\n\"It seems to me, Piers, as if it would be cruel to deny a dying man this\nlast act of grace.\"\n\"He does not deserve it.\"\n\"Ah! Piers, what do we deserve of God?\"\n\"Well,\" he said, \"I will go with you if I can get a hackney-coach; a\nlame fellow like me can't very well trudge down there on foot. But as\nyou do everything to please other people, it is only fair I should try\nto please you.\"\n\"I don't wish to tell mother yet, but I will go and call Susan, dear,\ngood Susan, and tell her to get ready.\"\n\"I hope she won't make a scene,\" Piers said, \"I hate scenes, and I don't\nsee what good you will do, but here goes;\" and Piers took his hat and\nwent to do his sister's bidding.",

This boy, who was one day,\nto be foremost in the ranks of those who carried the standard of truth,\nand justice, and charity into the very thick of the conflict with the\npowers of darkness, thus spoke--long, long after most of those who had\ntaken any part in those three awful days were dead--to an audience who\nwere inhabitants of the city of Bristol, and to whom, therefore, the\nsubject was of especial interest. He said:\n\"I was a schoolboy in Clifton, up above Bristol. I had been hearing of\npolitical disturbances, even of riots, of which I understood nothing,\nand for which I cared nothing.\n\"But on one memorable Sunday afternoon I saw an object which was\ndistinctly not political. It was an afternoon of sullen, autumn rain.\nThe fog hung thick over the docks and lowlands. Glaring through the fog\nI saw a bright mass of flame, almost like a half-risen sun. That, I was\ntold, was the gate of the new gaol on fire; that the prisoners had been\nset free. The fog rolled slowly upwards. Dark figures, even at that\ngreat distance, were flitting to and fro across what seemed the mouth of\nthe fire.\n\"The flames increased, multiplied at one point after another, till by\nten o'clock that night one seemed to be looking down upon Dante's\nInferno, and to hear the multitudinous moan and wail of the lost\nspirits, surging to and fro amid the sea of fire.\n\"Right behind Brandon Hill rose the central mass of fire, till the\nlittle mound seemed converted into a volcano, from the peak of which the\nflame streamed up, not red above, but delicately green and blue, pale\nrose, and pearly white, while crimson sparks leapt and fell again in the\nmidst of that rainbow, not of hope, but of despair; and dull explosions\ndown below mingled with the roar of the mob, and the infernal hiss and\ncrackle of the flames.\n\"Higher and higher the fog was scorched upward by the fierce heat below,\nglowing through and through with red, reflected glare, till it arched\nitself into one vast dome of red-hot iron, fit roof for all the madness\nbelow; and beneath it, miles away, I could see the lonely tower of\nDundry Church shining red--the symbol of the old Faith--looking down in\nstately wonder and sorrow upon the fearful birth-throes of a new age.\"\n* * * * *",

Call Susan\nto bring Joy, and we will go home at once. I must consult Mrs. Arundel,\nand ask her what it is best to do.\"\n\"You won't have time, for here they come,\" Piers said.\nYes; there was Charlotte, with her head on one side, and evidently\nsimpering at some compliment, which her companion was administering.\nWhen they came into the sitting-room, and stood face to face with Joyce,\none betrayed some annoyance, and the other some triumph.\n\"I thought you would have gone home yesterday, Charlotte,\" Joyce said,\nafter the first greeting. \"Is not Aunt Letitia anxious to see you?

I cannot see you wilfully ruin the happiness\nof your whole life by such an act.\"\n\"That's just what he said,\" Charlotte exclaimed. \"He said he knew you\nwould make objections, because Gilbert has often meddled in his\nconcerns before; but that will not change me. If you--if\nyou\"--Charlotte broke down, and became tearful--\"had been so hungry for\nsomebody to care for you as I have been, and had known what it was to be\nslighted and looked down upon, you would not be so cruel. It is all very\nwell for _you_. But you never did care what became of poor me, and I--I\nused to love you so much, Joyce.\"\nCharlotte began to sob piteously, and Joyce felt she must appear\nhard-hearted, and take the consequences.\nJust as she had dispelled the vision of the raindrop which was to revive\nthe drooping rose many years ago, so now she must do her best to dispel\na far more dangerous illusion.\n\"Lord Maythorne is not a good man,\" she said; \"he is continually in\ndebt; he often plays high, and he has been living abroad all these years\nin what manner we hardly know. We believe that he came to Bristol now,\nsimply to get some money out of his sister, my mother-in-law. Surely,\nCharlotte, you must see that if you marry him you will be miserable.\"\n\"Gratian married Melville, and you prophesied the same then; and they\nare very happy.\"\n\"That is a very different case. Gratian is older, wiser, and stronger\nthan Melville, and keeps him right by the force of her own will.\nBesides, Melville was weak, and easily yielded to temptation; but he was\nnot like Lord Maythorne, who did his best to ruin him in his Oxford\ndays.\"\n\"He says--he says that is all a lie of Gilbert's.\"\n\"How dare you speak like that of my husband! A lie! As if he ever\nstooped to tell a lie.\" Joyce flushed angrily, and continued: \"You are a\npoor, weak, sentimental girl, not a girl, for you are nearly thirty, and\nif you do not know what is good for you, you must be taken care of.

      "text": "This, then, was the end of Miss Falconer's training, this the reward for\nall her care; and the strange part of it was that, though Lord\nMaythorne's own relations were distressed and sad, at the thought of\nCharlotte's folly in committing herself to the tender mercies of such a\nman, Miss Falconer was _not_ distressed.\nGratian, who came in to spend a day or two in Clifton with her\nhusband soon after, gave a graphic description of the whole affair.\n[Illustration: Wells Cathedral from Bishop's Fields]\nMiss Falconer, she declared, was tearful, but in her secret heart\nelated. Charlotte would grace any position, Lord Maythorne said. She was\nstrikingly like in manner and voice and bearing to a reigning beauty at\none of the German baths.\n\"We are none of us likely to go there, you know,\" Gratian said, \"so we\ncan't vouch for the truth of this.\"\nThen he told Miss Falconer that Charlotte should be placed in the \"book\nof Beauty\" next season, and that a friend of his had promised to write a\nlittle sketch of her.\nAunt Letitia said she was _glad_ to be able to assure Lord Maythorne\nthat the Falconers were an ancient race, and had been landed gentry for\ngenerations.\n\"Poor dear old lady,\" Gratian continued, \"the only note of lament was,\n'What will Mrs. Hannah More say?' She took such a deep interest in dear\nCharlotte and, perhaps, I may wish, as _she_ will, that Lord Maythorne\nwas more strictly a religious man. But we cannot hope for everything,\nand dear Charlotte's training has been so careful, that I am not anxious\non that score.\"\n\"Poor dear old auntie!\" Melville exclaimed, when, after listening to\nhis wife's rapid chatter, he succeeded in getting in a word.\n\"She'll soon find cause to be anxious when Maythorne comes to her for a\nbit of thin paper with a good round sum in the corner.\"\nJoyce could not speak so lightly of this as Gratian did. She almost\nreproached herself for not being more honest with Charlotte in days long\npast, rousing her from dreams of fancied bliss to the great \"realities\"\nof life.\nAs she clasped her Baby Joy in her arms that night, she murmured over\nher tender words, and prayed that she might lead her three little\ndaughters in the right way, and teach them that the woman who fears the\nLord is to be praised, and that anchored to those words, they might\nescape the rocks and quicksands in which so many like poor Charlotte had\nfoundered.\nFor the present, indeed, Charlotte was satisfied. Lord Maythorne bought\nher, or rather procured for her, many of the fine things she had often\nlonged for. He felt a certain pride in her graceful manners, and\nperhaps, a little grateful affection for her intense admiration of\nhimself--that romantic admiration which had not yet had time to grow\nfaint!\nHe bought her the last complete edition of Lord Byron's poetry, and\nCharlotte bathed in that not very wholesome stream, and produced some\nimitative stanzas, which were printed in the _Bath Chronicle_, with a\nlittle paragraph by the editor, that they were from the pen of \"a\ncharming lady of title.\"\nA copy of the paper, delivered in the Close at Wells, went the round of\nthe little community, and, fluttered with delight, Miss Falconer told\nadmiring friends that dear Charlotte's husband was a man of cultivated\ntaste and encouraged her muse.\nThe days of dearth and barrenness will come, _must_ come, to those who\nsow their seed upon the stony ground. The bright sky must cloud over,\nthe winds and waves roar and swell, and the house that is builded on the\nsand must fall, and great shall be the ruin of it. Secure in the present\ncalm, poor little frail barks skim the surface and are content. Thus we\nleave Charlotte, and will not look at her again, lest we see that\nsaddest of all sad sights, the falling of the prop on which she leaned\nin her blindness and foolishness, the breaking of the staff which shall\nsurely pierce her hand with a wound which no earthly power can avail to\nheal.",

The lowlands, sloping down to the mouth of the Severn, were\nbathed in the sunshine, and beyond, in clear outline, was the great\nencircling range of blue mountains on the opposite coast of Wales. In\nthe clear atmosphere of the winter morning, everything was distinctly\nseen. The wooded headland of Portishead shot out to the left, and was\nrounded at full tide by many ships, outward bound for the rolling waters\nof the Atlantic.\nSnowy gulls dipped and whirled on airy flight near the shore, and small\ncrafts, with all sails set, danced and curtseyed beneath them as they\nmade for the harbour.\n\"It is a place to rest and get well in,\" Gilbert thought; and then he",

I always think of dear father when I stand\nhere, and poor merry, happy Bunny, swept into that surging sea.\"\n\"Yes,\" Piers said, sighing; \"the strong are taken and the weakly ones\nleft. Harry is, I suppose, half way round the world again in the\n'Persis.' There is Ralph working hard and enduring a good deal at the\nold home, while I----\"\n\"You are not unhappy, dear?\" Joyce asked, anxiously.\n\"No,\" he said; but the \"No\" was not heartily said. \"After all, we think\ntoo much of ourselves and all our little concerns. Why, Joyce, what are\nwe and this earth we live in, when compared to that great universe of\nwhich these stars, as they come out one by one, seem to bring a nightly\nmessage? What are we, to think so much of ourselves? and what are life,\nand death, and troubles, and joys, and petty disappointments? They are\nnothing--lighter than dust in the balance.\"\n\"They are something to God,\" Joyce said, reverently. \"He has told us so.\nDearest Piers, you are not losing that Faith which we used to call our\nstaff in the dear old days.\"\nPiers was silent for a moment.\n\"Joyce,\" he said, at last, \"I like to talk to you sometimes. I sit and\nread in my den, and go out and in of the sitting room and see how mother\nis getting on, and my brain gets full of cobwebs and I am impatient, and\nlong to spring up into a better and nobler life, and yet I am tied down.\nDon't you think I did not feel my miserable weakness when I heard of\nGilbert, in the thick of the rioters, saving a woman and child, and\nbravely doing his best in the face of the weakness and incompetence of\nthose about him? I felt as if I would have given something to get a hard\nthump on my head in such a cause, the cause of humanity.\"\n\"Piers, you are dull at home, I know, but you have the delightful young\ndoctor for a friend.\"\n\"Yes; but I can't sham illness to get him to come; he is a long way off.\nBut I am doing some more diagrams for his lecture on Fungi.\"\n\"I am so glad; and Piers, when Gilbert can really afford it, we are\ngoing to have a house in the country, and call it 'The Haven,' and you\nand mother shall come and live with us, and you shall help me to teach\nFalcon, and we shall be so happy.\"\n\"Ah! that is looking a long way forward, Joyce. Perhaps my haven will be\nhere, under the shadow of this old church, before then. But I feel the\nbetter already for being with you, old Joyce; you are just the same as\nyou ever were.\"\nThe brother and sister exchanged a kiss, and then, in the silence of\nperfect sympathy and affection, walked back to the house.",

The\nkiss and blessing did not disturb Lettice or Lota, but the \"Happy new\nyear, darling,\" brought Falcon to a state of half consciousness.\n\"Happy new year, mother--father,\" he murmured, with an added word which\nsounded like \"my trumpet.\"\n\"That beloved trumpet,\" said Joyce, laughing. \"I let him take it out\ninto the garden after dinner, and give one great blow; but he was so\nloyal, he came and hid it again, out of sight, saying, 'If father heard\nthat, it was only just _once_.'\"\n\"Dear old boy!\" Gilbert said. \"I shall not forget his self-denial\nlearned from his mother.\"\n\"Nay,\" she said, playfully, \"I do not quite wish to blow trumpets.\"\n\"Not your own, certainly,\" was the quiet rejoinder.\nThey did not forget baby Joy. Her cradle was in their own room; and\nJoyce called her husband to look at her, and wish her the \"happy new\nyear,\" as he had wished the others.\n\"A happy new year to my little Joy,\" he said.\nThe baby moved a little, and, throwing one fat arm behind her head, a\nflickering smile played over her face, a light rather than a smile, such\nas comes over the faces of the little ones sometimes when in sleep,\ntheir angels draw near.\nIt was one of those supreme moments in life, which do not find\nexpression in many words:--\n\"A happy new year to you, my little Joy,\" Joyce repeated, and then there\nwas silence, while--\n\"Two faces o'er the cradle bent,\nTwo hands above the head were locked,\nThese pressed each other while they rocked,\nThose watched a life that Love had sent.\nO solemn hour!\nO hidden power!\"\nTHE END",
