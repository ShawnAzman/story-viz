Il y a une grande comp\u00e9tition entre les \u00ab\u00a0As\u00a0\u00bb,\ntant entre ennemis qu'au sein d'un m\u00eame camp.\nLes grandes figures de cette \u00e9poque sont les Fran\u00e7ais Guynemer et Ren\u00e9 Fonck\n(plus grand As fran\u00e7ais et de la guerre selon la m\u00e9thode de calcul), ainsi que\nles Allemands Manfred von Richthofen (surnomm\u00e9 Le Baron Rouge), et Ernst Udet.\nLe soir du 10 juin 1916 a lieu le premier combat a\u00e9ronaval de l'Histoire, en\nAfrique \u00e9quatoriale. Un hydravion de fabrication britannique de type Short 184,\npilot\u00e9 par les lieutenants belges Behaeghe et Collignon, bombarde avec succ\u00e8s\nla canonni\u00e8re allemande Graf von G\u00f6tzen dans le port de Kigoma (actuelle\nTanzanie) sur le lac Tanganyika \u00e0 l'aide d'une de ses deux bombes de 65 livres\nqui l'atteint au gaillard d'arri\u00e8re mettant hors d'\u00e9tat sa gouverne. Le navire\nest ainsi neutralis\u00e9 ce qui brise le verrou allemand sur le lac, entre le Congo\nbelge et l'Est Africain allemand qui avait \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place deux ans plus t\u00f4t.\nLes canonniers allemands n'ont pu riposter contre cette attaque a\u00e9rienne car\nleurs pi\u00e8ces d'artillerie, pr\u00e9vues pour des cibles c\u00f4ti\u00e8res ou navales (nous\nn'\u00e9tions qu'au d\u00e9but de l'aviation), ne s'\u00e9levaient pas selon un angle\nsuffisant pour menacer des avions (consid\u00e9r\u00e9s par les Allemands comme\ninexistants en Afrique \u00e9quatoriale). L'hydravion rejoignit sa base n\u00e9anmoins\navec 20 atteintes de balles de mitrailleuses tir\u00e9es de Kigoma et un flotteur\nperc\u00e9.",

      "text": "#### Le Concorde\nL'avion supersonique de transport de passagers Concorde est le fruit d'une\ncoop\u00e9ration entre les constructeurs fran\u00e7ais A\u00e9rospatiale et britannique BAC\nqui r\u00e9sulte d'un accord sign\u00e9 entre les deux gouvernements en novembre 1962. Le\npremier prototype, assembl\u00e9 \u00e0 Saint-Martin, vole le 2 mars 1969 suivi par celui\nassembl\u00e9 \u00e0 Filton, le 9 avril. Le fuselage, d'une longueur de 62\u00a0m\u00e8tres, permet\nd'emporter 128 passagers sur une distance maximale de 6\u00a0400\u00a0km \u00e0 une vitesse de\nMach 2,05. Quatre r\u00e9acteurs Olympus de 17\u00a0250\u00a0daN de pouss\u00e9e propulsent cet\navion de 25\u00a0m d'envergure et d'une masse au d\u00e9collage de 181\u00a0000\u00a0kg.\nL'int\u00e9r\u00eat initial des compagnies a\u00e9riennes est limit\u00e9, elles pr\u00e9f\u00e8rent\ns'\u00e9quiper en avions gros porteurs\u00a0; le choc p\u00e9trolier de 1971 et des\nconsid\u00e9rations environnementales (bruit et pollution) des supersoniques\nentra\u00eeneront l'annulation des r\u00e9servations et l'avion ne sera command\u00e9 que par\nles compagnies Air France et British Airways. En effet le Concorde est\nparticuli\u00e8rement bruyant au d\u00e9collage et produit un bang supersonique en\ncroisi\u00e8re, ce qui est g\u00eanant pour les populations s'il survole des zones\ncontinentales habit\u00e9es.",
