Our last King,\nWhose image even but now appear'd to us,\nWas, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,\nThereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,\nDar'd to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet,\nFor so this side of our known world esteem'd him,\nDid slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,\nWell ratified by law and heraldry,\nDid forfeit, with his life, all those his lands\nWhich he stood seiz'd of, to the conqueror;\nAgainst the which, a moiety competent\nWas gaged by our King; which had return'd\nTo the inheritance of Fortinbras,\nHad he been vanquisher; as by the same cov'nant\nAnd carriage of the article design'd,\nHis fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,\nOf unimproved mettle, hot and full,\nHath in the skirts of Norway, here and there,\nShark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,\nFor food and diet, to some enterprise\nThat hath a stomach in't; which is no other,\nAs it doth well appear unto our state,\nBut to recover of us by strong hand\nAnd terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands\nSo by his father lost. And this, I take it,\nIs the main motive of our preparations,\nThe source of this our watch, and the chief head\nOf this post-haste and rummage in the land.\nBARNARDO.\nI think it be no other but e'en so:\nWell may it sort that this portentous figure\nComes armed through our watch so like the King\nThat was and is the question of these wars.\nHORATIO.\nA mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.\nIn the most high and palmy state of Rome,\nA little ere the mightiest Julius fell,\nThe graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead\nDid squeak and gibber in the Roman streets;\nAs stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,\nDisasters in the sun; and the moist star,\nUpon whose influence Neptune's empire stands,\nWas sick almost to doomsday with eclipse.\nAnd even the like precurse of fierce events,\nAs harbingers preceding still the fates\nAnd prologue to the omen coming on,\nHave heaven and earth together demonstrated\nUnto our climatures and countrymen.\nRe-enter Ghost.\nBut, soft, behold! Lo, where it comes again!\nI'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!\nIf thou hast any sound, or use of voice,\nSpeak to me.\nIf there be any good thing to be done,\nThat may to thee do ease, and grace to me,\nSpeak to me.\nIf thou art privy to thy country's fate,\nWhich, happily, foreknowing may avoid,\nO speak!\nOr if thou hast uphoarded in thy life\nExtorted treasure in the womb of earth,\nFor which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,\nSpeak of it. Stay, and speak!\n[_The cock crows._]\nStop it, Marcellus!\nMARCELLUS.\nShall I strike at it with my partisan?\nHORATIO.\nDo, if it will not stand.\nBARNARDO.\n'Tis here!\nHORATIO.\n'Tis here!\n[_Exit Ghost._]\nMARCELLUS.\n'Tis gone!\nWe do it wrong, being so majestical,\nTo offer it the show of violence,\nFor it is as the air, invulnerable,\nAnd our vain blows malicious mockery.\nBARNARDO.\nIt was about to speak, when the cock crew.\nHORATIO.\nAnd then it started, like a guilty thing\nUpon a fearful summons. I have heard\nThe cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,\nDoth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat\nAwake the god of day; and at his warning,\nWhether in sea or fire, in earth or air,\nTh'extravagant and erring spirit hies\nTo his confine. And of the truth herein\nThis present object made probation.\nMARCELLUS.\nIt faded on the crowing of the cock.\nSome say that ever 'gainst that season comes\nWherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,\nThe bird of dawning singeth all night long;\nAnd then, they say, no spirit dare stir abroad,\nThe nights are wholesome, then no planets strike,\nNo fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm;\nSo hallow'd and so gracious is the time.\nHORATIO.\nSo have I heard, and do in part believe it.\nBut look, the morn in russet mantle clad,\nWalks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill.\nBreak we our watch up, and by my advice,\nLet us impart what we have seen tonight\nUnto young Hamlet; for upon my life,\nThis spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.\nDo you consent we shall acquaint him with it,\nAs needful in our loves, fitting our duty?\nMARCELLUS.\nLet's do't, I pray, and I this morning know\nWhere we shall find him most conveniently.\n[_Exeunt._]",

A room of state in the Castle.\nEnter Claudius King of Denmark, Gertrude the Queen, Hamlet, Polonius,\nLaertes, Voltemand,\nCornelius, Lords and Attendant.\nKING.\nThough yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death\nThe memory be green, and that it us befitted\nTo bear our hearts in grief, and our whole kingdom\nTo be contracted in one brow of woe;\nYet so far hath discretion fought with nature\nThat we with wisest sorrow think on him,\nTogether with remembrance of ourselves.\nTherefore our sometime sister, now our queen,\nTh'imperial jointress to this warlike state,\nHave we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,\nWith one auspicious and one dropping eye,\nWith mirth in funeral, and with dirge in marriage,\nIn equal scale weighing delight and dole,\nTaken to wife; nor have we herein barr'd\nYour better wisdoms, which have freely gone\nWith this affair along. For all, our thanks.\nNow follows, that you know young Fortinbras,\nHolding a weak supposal of our worth,\nOr thinking by our late dear brother's death\nOur state to be disjoint and out of frame,\nColleagued with this dream of his advantage,\nHe hath not fail'd to pester us with message,\nImporting the surrender of those lands\nLost by his father, with all bonds of law,\nTo our most valiant brother. So much for him.\nNow for ourself and for this time of meeting:\nThus much the business is: we have here writ\nTo Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,\nWho, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears\nOf this his nephew's purpose, to suppress\nHis further gait herein; in that the levies,\nThe lists, and full proportions are all made\nOut of his subject: and we here dispatch\nYou, good Cornelius, and you, Voltemand,\nFor bearers of this greeting to old Norway,\nGiving to you no further personal power\nTo business with the King, more than the scope\nOf these dilated articles allow.\nFarewell; and let your haste commend your duty.\nCORNELIUS and VOLTEMAND.\nIn that, and all things, will we show our duty.\nKING.\nWe doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.\n[_Exeunt Voltemand and Cornelius._]\nAnd now, Laertes, what's the news with you?\nYou told us of some suit. What is't, Laertes?\nYou cannot speak of reason to the Dane,\nAnd lose your voice. What wouldst thou beg, Laertes,\nThat shall not be my offer, not thy asking?\nThe head is not more native to the heart,\nThe hand more instrumental to the mouth,\nThan is the throne of Denmark to thy father.\nWhat wouldst thou have, Laertes?\nLAERTES.\nDread my lord,\nYour leave and favour to return to France,\nFrom whence though willingly I came to Denmark\nTo show my duty in your coronation;\nYet now I must confess, that duty done,\nMy thoughts and wishes bend again toward France,\nAnd bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.\nKING.\nHave you your father's leave? What says Polonius?\nPOLONIUS.\nHe hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave\nBy laboursome petition; and at last\nUpon his will I seal'd my hard consent.\nI do beseech you give him leave to go.\nKING.\nTake thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,\nAnd thy best graces spend it at thy will!\nBut now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son\u2014\nHAMLET.\n[_Aside._] A little more than kin, and less than kind.\nKING.\nHow is it that the clouds still hang on you?\nHAMLET.\nNot so, my lord, I am too much i' the sun.\nQUEEN.\nGood Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,\nAnd let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.\nDo not for ever with thy vailed lids\nSeek for thy noble father in the dust.\nThou know'st 'tis common, all that lives must die,\nPassing through nature to eternity.\nHAMLET.\nAy, madam, it is common.\nQUEEN.\nIf it be,\nWhy seems it so particular with thee?\nHAMLET.\nSeems, madam! Nay, it is; I know not seems.\n'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,\nNor customary suits of solemn black,\nNor windy suspiration of forc'd breath,\nNo, nor the fruitful river in the eye,\nNor the dejected haviour of the visage,\nTogether with all forms, moods, shows of grief,\nThat can denote me truly. These indeed seem,\nFor they are actions that a man might play;\nBut I have that within which passeth show;\nThese but the trappings and the suits of woe.\nKING.\n'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,\nTo give these mourning duties to your father;\nBut you must know, your father lost a father,\nThat father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound\nIn filial obligation, for some term\nTo do obsequious sorrow. But to persevere\nIn obstinate condolement is a course\nOf impious stubbornness. 'Tis unmanly grief,\nIt shows a will most incorrect to heaven,\nA heart unfortified, a mind impatient,\nAn understanding simple and unschool'd;\nFor what we know must be, and is as common\nAs any the most vulgar thing to sense,\nWhy should we in our peevish opposition\nTake it to heart? Fie, 'tis a fault to heaven,\nA fault against the dead, a fault to nature,\nTo reason most absurd, whose common theme\nIs death of fathers, and who still hath cried,\nFrom the first corse till he that died today,\n'This must be so.' We pray you throw to earth\nThis unprevailing woe, and think of us\nAs of a father; for let the world take note\nYou are the most immediate to our throne,\nAnd with no less nobility of love\nThan that which dearest father bears his son\nDo I impart toward you. For your intent\nIn going back to school in Wittenberg,\nIt is most retrograde to our desire:\nAnd we beseech you bend you to remain\nHere in the cheer and comfort of our eye,\nOur chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.\nQUEEN.\nLet not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet.\nI pray thee stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.\nHAMLET.\nI shall in all my best obey you, madam.\nKING.\nWhy, 'tis a loving and a fair reply.\nBe as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;\nThis gentle and unforc'd accord of Hamlet\nSits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof,\nNo jocund health that Denmark drinks today\nBut the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,\nAnd the King's rouse the heaven shall bruit again,\nRe-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.\n[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]",

Farewell.\nAnd, sister, as the winds give benefit\nAnd convoy is assistant, do not sleep,\nBut let me hear from you.\nOPHELIA.\nDo you doubt that?\nLAERTES.\nFor Hamlet, and the trifling of his favour,\nHold it a fashion and a toy in blood;\nA violet in the youth of primy nature,\nForward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting;\nThe perfume and suppliance of a minute;\nNo more.\nOPHELIA.\nNo more but so?\nLAERTES.\nThink it no more.\nFor nature crescent does not grow alone\nIn thews and bulk; but as this temple waxes,\nThe inward service of the mind and soul\nGrows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,\nAnd now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch\nThe virtue of his will; but you must fear,\nHis greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;\nFor he himself is subject to his birth:\nHe may not, as unvalu'd persons do,\nCarve for himself; for on his choice depends\nThe sanctity and health of this whole state;\nAnd therefore must his choice be circumscrib'd\nUnto the voice and yielding of that body\nWhereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,\nIt fits your wisdom so far to believe it\nAs he in his particular act and place\nMay give his saying deed; which is no further\nThan the main voice of Denmark goes withal.\nThen weigh what loss your honour may sustain\nIf with too credent ear you list his songs,\nOr lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open\nTo his unmaster'd importunity.\nFear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister;\nAnd keep you in the rear of your affection,\nOut of the shot and danger of desire.\nThe chariest maid is prodigal enough\nIf she unmask her beauty to the moon.\nVirtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:\nThe canker galls the infants of the spring\nToo oft before their buttons be disclos'd,\nAnd in the morn and liquid dew of youth\nContagious blastments are most imminent.\nBe wary then, best safety lies in fear.\nYouth to itself rebels, though none else near.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall th'effect of this good lesson keep\nAs watchman to my heart. But good my brother,\nDo not as some ungracious pastors do,\nShow me the steep and thorny way to heaven;\nWhilst like a puff'd and reckless libertine\nHimself the primrose path of dalliance treads,\nAnd recks not his own rede.\nLAERTES.\nO, fear me not.\nI stay too long. But here my father comes.\nEnter Polonius.\nA double blessing is a double grace;\nOccasion smiles upon a second leave.\nPOLONIUS.\nYet here, Laertes? Aboard, aboard, for shame.\nThe wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,\nAnd you are stay'd for. There, my blessing with you.\n[_Laying his hand on Laertes's head._]\nAnd these few precepts in thy memory\nLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,\nNor any unproportion'd thought his act.\nBe thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.\nThose friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,\nGrapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel;\nBut do not dull thy palm with entertainment\nOf each new-hatch'd, unfledg'd comrade. Beware\nOf entrance to a quarrel; but being in,\nBear't that th'opposed may beware of thee.\nGive every man thine ear, but few thy voice:\nTake each man's censure, but reserve thy judgement.\nCostly thy habit as thy purse can buy,\nBut not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:\nFor the apparel oft proclaims the man;\nAnd they in France of the best rank and station\nAre of a most select and generous chief in that.\nNeither a borrower nor a lender be:\nFor loan oft loses both itself and friend;\nAnd borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.\nThis above all: to thine own self be true;\nAnd it must follow, as the night the day,\nThou canst not then be false to any man.\nFarewell: my blessing season this in thee.\nLAERTES.\nMost humbly do I take my leave, my lord.\nPOLONIUS.\nThe time invites you; go, your servants tend.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell, Ophelia, and remember well\nWhat I have said to you.\nOPHELIA.\n'Tis in my memory lock'd,\nAnd you yourself shall keep the key of it.\nLAERTES.\nFarewell.\n[_Exit._]\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat is't, Ophelia, he hath said to you?\nOPHELIA.\nSo please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.\nPOLONIUS.\nMarry, well bethought:\n'Tis told me he hath very oft of late\nGiven private time to you; and you yourself\nHave of your audience been most free and bounteous.\nIf it be so,\u2014as so 'tis put on me,\nAnd that in way of caution,\u2014I must tell you\nYou do not understand yourself so clearly\nAs it behoves my daughter and your honour.\nWhat is between you? Give me up the truth.\nOPHELIA.\nHe hath, my lord, of late made many tenders\nOf his affection to me.\nPOLONIUS.\nAffection! Pooh! You speak like a green girl,\nUnsifted in such perilous circumstance.\nDo you believe his tenders, as you call them?\nOPHELIA.\nI do not know, my lord, what I should think.\nPOLONIUS.\nMarry, I'll teach you; think yourself a baby;\nThat you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,\nWhich are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;\nOr,\u2014not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,\nRunning it thus,\u2014you'll tender me a fool.\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord, he hath importun'd me with love\nIn honourable fashion.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.\nOPHELIA.\nAnd hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,\nWith almost all the holy vows of heaven.\nPOLONIUS.\nAy, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,\nWhen the blood burns, how prodigal the soul\nLends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,\nGiving more light than heat, extinct in both,\nEven in their promise, as it is a-making,\nYou must not take for fire. From this time\nBe something scanter of your maiden presence;\nSet your entreatments at a higher rate\nThan a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,\nBelieve so much in him that he is young;\nAnd with a larger tether may he walk\nThan may be given you. In few, Ophelia,\nDo not believe his vows; for they are brokers,\nNot of that dye which their investments show,\nBut mere implorators of unholy suits,\nBreathing like sanctified and pious bawds,\nThe better to beguile. This is for all:\nI would not, in plain terms, from this time forth\nHave you so slander any moment leisure\nAs to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.\nLook to't, I charge you; come your ways.\nOPHELIA.\nI shall obey, my lord.\n[_Exeunt._]",

What may this mean,\nThat thou, dead corse, again in complete steel,\nRevisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,\nMaking night hideous, and we fools of nature\nSo horridly to shake our disposition\nWith thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?\nSay, why is this? Wherefore? What should we do?\n[_Ghost beckons Hamlet._]\nHORATIO.\nIt beckons you to go away with it,\nAs if it some impartment did desire\nTo you alone.\nMARCELLUS.\nLook with what courteous action\nIt waves you to a more removed ground.\nBut do not go with it.\nHORATIO.\nNo, by no means.\nHAMLET.\nIt will not speak; then will I follow it.\nHORATIO.\nDo not, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, what should be the fear?\nI do not set my life at a pin's fee;\nAnd for my soul, what can it do to that,\nBeing a thing immortal as itself?\nIt waves me forth again.

Think of it.\nThe very place puts toys of desperation,\nWithout more motive, into every brain\nThat looks so many fathoms to the sea\nAnd hears it roar beneath.\nHAMLET.\nIt waves me still.\nGo on, I'll follow thee.\nMARCELLUS.\nYou shall not go, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nHold off your hands.\nHORATIO.\nBe rul'd; you shall not go.\nHAMLET.\nMy fate cries out,\nAnd makes each petty artery in this body\nAs hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.\n[_Ghost beckons._]\nStill am I call'd.

But that I am forbid\nTo tell the secrets of my prison-house,\nI could a tale unfold whose lightest word\nWould harrow up thy soul; freeze thy young blood,\nMake thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres,\nThy knotted and combined locks to part,\nAnd each particular hair to stand on end\nLike quills upon the fretful porpentine.\nBut this eternal blazon must not be\nTo ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!\nIf thou didst ever thy dear father love\u2014\nHAMLET.\nO God!\nGHOST.\nRevenge his foul and most unnatural murder.\nHAMLET.\nMurder!\nGHOST.\nMurder most foul, as in the best it is;\nBut this most foul, strange, and unnatural.\nHAMLET.\nHaste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift\nAs meditation or the thoughts of love\nMay sweep to my revenge.\nGHOST.\nI find thee apt;\nAnd duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed\nThat rots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,\nWouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear.\n'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,\nA serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark\nIs by a forged process of my death\nRankly abus'd; but know, thou noble youth,\nThe serpent that did sting thy father's life\nNow wears his crown.\nHAMLET.\nO my prophetic soul!\nMine uncle!\nGHOST.\nAy, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,\nWith witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,\u2014\nO wicked wit, and gifts, that have the power\nSo to seduce!\u2014won to his shameful lust\nThe will of my most seeming-virtuous queen.\nO Hamlet, what a falling off was there,\nFrom me, whose love was of that dignity\nThat it went hand in hand even with the vow\nI made to her in marriage; and to decline\nUpon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor\nTo those of mine. But virtue, as it never will be mov'd,\nThough lewdness court it in a shape of heaven;\nSo lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,\nWill sate itself in a celestial bed\nAnd prey on garbage.\nBut soft! methinks I scent the morning air;\nBrief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,\nMy custom always of the afternoon,\nUpon my secure hour thy uncle stole\nWith juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\nAnd in the porches of my ears did pour\nThe leperous distilment, whose effect\nHolds such an enmity with blood of man\nThat swift as quicksilver it courses through\nThe natural gates and alleys of the body;\nAnd with a sudden vigour it doth posset\nAnd curd, like eager droppings into milk,\nThe thin and wholesome blood. So did it mine;\nAnd a most instant tetter bark'd about,\nMost lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust\nAll my smooth body.\nThus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand,\nOf life, of crown, of queen at once dispatch'd:\nCut off even in the blossoms of my sin,\nUnhous'led, disappointed, unanel'd;\nNo reckoning made, but sent to my account\nWith all my imperfections on my head.\nO horrible! O horrible! most horrible!\nIf thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;\nLet not the royal bed of Denmark be\nA couch for luxury and damned incest.\nBut howsoever thou pursu'st this act,\nTaint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive\nAgainst thy mother aught; leave her to heaven,\nAnd to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,\nTo prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!\nThe glow-worm shows the matin to be near,\nAnd 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire.\nAdieu, adieu, adieu. Remember me.\n[_Exit._]\nHAMLET.\nO all you host of heaven! O earth! What else?\nAnd shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, my heart;\nAnd you, my sinews, grow not instant old,\nBut bear me stiffly up. Remember thee?\nAy, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat\nIn this distracted globe. Remember thee?\nYea, from the table of my memory\nI'll wipe away all trivial fond records,\nAll saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\nThat youth and observation copied there;\nAnd thy commandment all alone shall live\nWithin the book and volume of my brain,\nUnmix'd with baser matter. Yes, by heaven!\nO most pernicious woman!\nO villain, villain, smiling damned villain!\nMy tables. Meet it is I set it down,\nThat one may smile, and smile, and be a villain!\nAt least I am sure it may be so in Denmark.\n[_Writing._]\nSo, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;\nIt is 'Adieu, adieu, remember me.'\nI have sworn't.\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\n[_Within._] My lord, my lord.\nMARCELLUS.\n[_Within._] Lord Hamlet.\nHORATIO.\n[_Within._] Heaven secure him.\nHAMLET.\nSo be it!\nMARCELLUS.\n[_Within._] Illo, ho, ho, my lord!\nHAMLET.\nHillo, ho, ho, boy!

Touching this vision here,\nIt is an honest ghost, that let me tell you.\nFor your desire to know what is between us,\nO'ermaster't as you may. And now, good friends,\nAs you are friends, scholars, and soldiers,\nGive me one poor request.\nHORATIO.\nWhat is't, my lord? We will.\nHAMLET.\nNever make known what you have seen tonight.\nHORATIO and MARCELLUS.\nMy lord, we will not.\nHAMLET.\nNay, but swear't.\nHORATIO.\nIn faith, my lord, not I.\nMARCELLUS.\nNor I, my lord, in faith.\nHAMLET.\nUpon my sword.\nMARCELLUS.\nWe have sworn, my lord, already.\nHAMLET.\nIndeed, upon my sword, indeed.\nGHOST.\n[_Cries under the stage._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nHa, ha boy, sayst thou so? Art thou there, truepenny?\nCome on, you hear this fellow in the cellarage.\nConsent to swear.\nHORATIO.\nPropose the oath, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nNever to speak of this that you have seen.\nSwear by my sword.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\n_Hic et ubique?_ Then we'll shift our ground.\nCome hither, gentlemen,\nAnd lay your hands again upon my sword.\nNever to speak of this that you have heard.\nSwear by my sword.\nGHOST.\n[_Beneath._] Swear.\nHAMLET.\nWell said, old mole!

How dost thou, Guildenstern? Ah,\nRosencrantz. Good lads, how do ye both?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nAs the indifferent children of the earth.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nHappy in that we are not over-happy;\nOn Fortune's cap we are not the very button.\nHAMLET.\nNor the soles of her shoe?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNeither, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThen you live about her waist, or in the middle of her favours?\nGUILDENSTERN.\nFaith, her privates we.\nHAMLET.\nIn the secret parts of Fortune? O, most true; she is a strumpet. What's\nthe news?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNone, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.\nHAMLET.\nThen is doomsday near. But your news is not true. Let me question more\nin particular. What have you, my good friends, deserved at the hands of\nFortune, that she sends you to prison hither?\nGUILDENSTERN.\nPrison, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nDenmark's a prison.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nThen is the world one.\nHAMLET.\nA goodly one; in which there are many confines, wards, and dungeons,\nDenmark being one o' th' worst.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWe think not so, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad but\nthinking makes it so. To me it is a prison.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nWhy, then your ambition makes it one; 'tis too narrow for your mind.\nHAMLET.\nO God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count myself a king of\ninfinite space, were it not that I have bad dreams.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nWhich dreams, indeed, are ambition; for the very substance of the\nambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.\nHAMLET.\nA dream itself is but a shadow.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTruly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a quality that it is\nbut a shadow's shadow.\nHAMLET.\nThen are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and outstretch'd heroes\nthe beggars' shadows. Shall we to th' court? For, by my fay, I cannot\nreason.\nROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\nWe'll wait upon you.\nHAMLET.\nNo such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my servants; for,\nto speak to you like an honest man, I am most dreadfully attended. But,\nin the beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTo visit you, my lord, no other occasion.\nHAMLET.\nBeggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I thank you. And sure,\ndear friends, my thanks are too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent\nfor? Is it your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deal\njustly with me. Come, come; nay, speak.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nWhat should we say, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy, anything. But to the purpose. You were sent for; and there is a\nkind of confession in your looks, which your modesties have not craft\nenough to colour. I know the good King and Queen have sent for you.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTo what end, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nThat you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by the rights of our\nfellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the obligation of our\never-preserved love, and by what more dear a better proposer could\ncharge you withal, be even and direct with me, whether you were sent\nfor or no.\nROSENCRANTZ.\n[_To Guildenstern._] What say you?\nHAMLET.\n[_Aside._] Nay, then I have an eye of you. If you love me, hold not\noff.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nMy lord, we were sent for.\nHAMLET.\nI will tell you why; so shall my anticipation prevent your discovery,\nand your secrecy to the King and Queen moult no feather. I have of\nlate, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custom\nof exercises; and indeed, it goes so heavily with my disposition that\nthis goodly frame the earth, seems to me a sterile promontory; this\nmost excellent canopy the air, look you, this brave o'erhanging\nfirmament, this majestical roof fretted with golden fire, why, it\nappears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of\nvapours. What a piece of work is man, how noble in reason, how infinite\nin faculties, in form and moving, how express and admirable; in action\nhow like an angel, in apprehension, how like a god: the beauty of the\nworld, the paragon of animals. And yet, to me, what is this\nquintessence of dust? Man delights not me; no, nor woman neither,\nthough by your smiling you seem to say so.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nMy lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.\nHAMLET.\nWhy did you laugh then, when I said 'Man delights not me'?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nTo think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what Lenten entertainment\nthe players shall receive from you. We coted them on the way, and\nhither are they coming to offer you service.\nHAMLET.\nHe that plays the king shall be welcome,\u2014his Majesty shall have tribute\nof me; the adventurous knight shall use his foil and target; the lover\nshall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace;\nthe clown shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickle o' th' sere;\nand the lady shall say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt\nfor't. What players are they?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nEven those you were wont to take such delight in\u2014the tragedians of the\ncity.\nHAMLET.\nHow chances it they travel? Their residence, both in reputation and\nprofit, was better both ways.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nI think their inhibition comes by the means of the late innovation.\nHAMLET.\nDo they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the city? Are\nthey so followed?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNo, indeed, they are not.\nHAMLET.\nHow comes it? Do they grow rusty?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nNay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace; but there is, sir, an\naerie of children, little eyases, that cry out on the top of question,\nand are most tyrannically clapped for't. These are now the fashion, and\nso berattle the common stages\u2014so they call them\u2014that many wearing\nrapiers are afraid of goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, are they children? Who maintains 'em? How are they escoted? Will\nthey pursue the quality no longer than they can sing? Will they not say\nafterwards, if they should grow themselves to common players\u2014as it is\nmost like, if their means are no better\u2014their writers do them wrong to\nmake them exclaim against their own succession?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nFaith, there has been much to do on both sides; and the nation holds it\nno sin to tarre them to controversy. There was for a while, no money\nbid for argument unless the poet and the player went to cuffs in the\nquestion.\nHAMLET.\nIs't possible?\nGUILDENSTERN.\nO, there has been much throwing about of brains.\nHAMLET.\nDo the boys carry it away?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nAy, that they do, my lord. Hercules and his load too.\nHAMLET.\nIt is not very strange; for my uncle is King of Denmark, and those that\nwould make mouths at him while my father lived, give twenty, forty,\nfifty, a hundred ducats apiece for his picture in little. 'Sblood,\nthere is something in this more than natural, if philosophy could find\nit out.\n[_Flourish of trumpets within._]\nGUILDENSTERN.\nThere are the players.\nHAMLET.\nGentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands, come. The\nappurtenance of welcome is fashion and ceremony. Let me comply with you\nin this garb, lest my extent to the players, which I tell you must show\nfairly outward, should more appear like entertainment than yours. You\nare welcome. But my uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.\nGUILDENSTERN.\nIn what, my dear lord?\nHAMLET.\nI am but mad north-north-west. When the wind is southerly, I know a\nhawk from a handsaw.\nEnter Polonius.\nPOLONIUS.\nWell be with you, gentlemen.\nHAMLET.\nHark you, Guildenstern, and you too, at each ear a hearer. That great\nbaby you see there is not yet out of his swaddling clouts.\nROSENCRANTZ.\nHappily he's the second time come to them; for they say an old man is\ntwice a child.\nHAMLET.\nI will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players. Mark it.\u2014You say\nright, sir: for a Monday morning 'twas so indeed.\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, I have news to tell you.\nHAMLET.\nMy lord, I have news to tell you. When Roscius was an actor in Rome\u2014\nPOLONIUS.\nThe actors are come hither, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nBuzz, buzz.\nPOLONIUS.\nUpon my honour.\nHAMLET.\nThen came each actor on his ass\u2014\nPOLONIUS.\nThe best actors in the world, either for tragedy, comedy, history,\npastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical,\ntragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem\nunlimited. Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too light, for the\nlaw of writ and the liberty. These are the only men.\nHAMLET.\nO Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat treasure had he, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy\u2014\n'One fair daughter, and no more,\nThe which he loved passing well.'\nPOLONIUS.\n[_Aside._] Still on my daughter.\nHAMLET.\nAm I not i' th' right, old Jephthah?\nPOLONIUS.\nIf you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter that I love passing\nwell.\nHAMLET.\nNay, that follows not.\nPOLONIUS.\nWhat follows then, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nWhy,\nAs by lot, God wot,\nand then, you know,\nIt came to pass, as most like it was.\nThe first row of the pious chanson will show you more. For look where\nmy abridgement comes.\nEnter four or five Players.\nYou are welcome, masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well.\nWelcome, good friends. O, my old friend! Thy face is valanc'd since I\nsaw thee last. Com'st thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young lady\nand mistress!

Masters, you\nare all welcome. We'll e'en to't like French falconers, fly at anything\nwe see. We'll have a speech straight. Come, give us a taste of your\nquality. Come, a passionate speech.\nFIRST PLAYER.\nWhat speech, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nI heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was never acted, or if it\nwas, not above once, for the play, I remember, pleased not the million,\n'twas caviare to the general. But it was\u2014as I received it, and others,\nwhose judgements in such matters cried in the top of mine\u2014an excellent\nplay, well digested in the scenes, set down with as much modesty as\ncunning. I remember one said there were no sallets in the lines to make\nthe matter savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might indite the\nauthor of affectation, but called it an honest method, as wholesome as\nsweet, and by very much more handsome than fine. One speech in it, I\nchiefly loved. 'Twas Aeneas' tale to Dido, and thereabout of it\nespecially where he speaks of Priam's slaughter. If it live in your\nmemory, begin at this line, let me see, let me see:\n_The rugged Pyrrhus, like th' Hyrcanian beast,\u2014_\nIt is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus\u2014\n_The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,\nBlack as his purpose, did the night resemble\nWhen he lay couched in the ominous horse,\nHath now this dread and black complexion smear'd\nWith heraldry more dismal. Head to foot\nNow is he total gules, horridly trick'd\nWith blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,\nBak'd and impasted with the parching streets,\nThat lend a tyrannous and a damned light\nTo their vile murders. Roasted in wrath and fire,\nAnd thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,\nWith eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus\nOld grandsire Priam seeks._\nSo, proceed you.\nPOLONIUS.\n'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and good discretion.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n_Anon he finds him,\nStriking too short at Greeks. His antique sword,\nRebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,\nRepugnant to command. Unequal match'd,\nPyrrhus at Priam drives, in rage strikes wide;\nBut with the whiff and wind of his fell sword\nTh'unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,\nSeeming to feel this blow, with flaming top\nStoops to his base, and with a hideous crash\nTakes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear. For lo, his sword,\nWhich was declining on the milky head\nOf reverend Priam, seem'd i' th'air to stick.\nSo, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,\nAnd like a neutral to his will and matter,\nDid nothing.\nBut as we often see against some storm,\nA silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,\nThe bold winds speechless, and the orb below\nAs hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder\nDoth rend the region; so after Pyrrhus' pause,\nAroused vengeance sets him new a-work,\nAnd never did the Cyclops' hammers fall\nOn Mars's armour, forg'd for proof eterne,\nWith less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword\nNow falls on Priam.\nOut, out, thou strumpet Fortune! All you gods,\nIn general synod, take away her power;\nBreak all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,\nAnd bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,\nAs low as to the fiends._\nPOLONIUS.\nThis is too long.\nHAMLET.\nIt shall to the barber's, with your beard.\u2014Prithee say on.\nHe's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.\nSay on; come to Hecuba.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n_But who, O who, had seen the mobled queen,\u2014_\nHAMLET.\n'The mobled queen'?\nPOLONIUS.\nThat's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.\nFIRST PLAYER.\n_Run barefoot up and down, threat'ning the flames\nWith bisson rheum. A clout upon that head\nWhere late the diadem stood, and for a robe,\nAbout her lank and all o'erteemed loins,\nA blanket, in th'alarm of fear caught up\u2014\nWho this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,\n'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have pronounc'd.\nBut if the gods themselves did see her then,\nWhen she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport\nIn mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,\nThe instant burst of clamour that she made,\u2014\nUnless things mortal move them not at all,\u2014\nWould have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,\nAnd passion in the gods._\nPOLONIUS.\nLook, where he has not turn'd his colour, and has tears in's eyes. Pray\nyou, no more.\nHAMLET.\n'Tis well. I'll have thee speak out the rest of this soon.\u2014Good my\nlord, will you see the players well bestowed? Do you hear, let them be\nwell used; for they are the abstracts and brief chronicles of the time.\nAfter your death you were better have a bad epitaph than their ill\nreport while you live.\nPOLONIUS.\nMy lord, I will use them according to their desert.\nHAMLET.\nGod's bodikin, man, much better. Use every man after his desert, and who\nshould 'scape whipping? Use them after your own honour and dignity. The\nless they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty. Take them in.\nPOLONIUS.\nCome, sirs.\nHAMLET.\nFollow him, friends. We'll hear a play tomorrow.\n[_Exeunt Polonius with all the Players but the First._]\nDost thou hear me, old friend? Can you play _The Murder of Gonzago_?\nFIRST PLAYER.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWe'll ha't tomorrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some\ndozen or sixteen lines, which I would set down and insert in't, could\nyou not?\nFIRST PLAYER.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nVery well. Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.\n[_Exit First Player._]\n[_To Rosencrantz and Guildenstern_] My good friends, I'll leave you\ntill night. You are welcome to Elsinore.",

Yet I,\nA dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak\nLike John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,\nAnd can say nothing. No, not for a king\nUpon whose property and most dear life\nA damn'd defeat was made.

To die\u2014to sleep,\nNo more; and by a sleep to say we end\nThe heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks\nThat flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation\nDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep.\nTo sleep, perchance to dream\u2014ay, there's the rub,\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come,\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\nMust give us pause. There's the respect\nThat makes calamity of so long life.\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\nThe oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,\nThe pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would these fardels bear,\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\nBut that the dread of something after death,\nThe undiscover'd country, from whose bourn\nNo traveller returns, puzzles the will,\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\nThus conscience does make cowards of us all,\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\nIs sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment,\nWith this regard their currents turn awry\nAnd lose the name of action. Soft you now,\nThe fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons\nBe all my sins remember'd.\nOPHELIA.\nGood my lord,\nHow does your honour for this many a day?\nHAMLET.\nI humbly thank you; well, well, well.\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord, I have remembrances of yours\nThat I have longed long to re-deliver.\nI pray you, now receive them.\nHAMLET.\nNo, not I.\nI never gave you aught.\nOPHELIA.\nMy honour'd lord, you know right well you did,\nAnd with them words of so sweet breath compos'd\nAs made the things more rich; their perfume lost,\nTake these again; for to the noble mind\nRich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.\nThere, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nHa, ha! Are you honest?\nOPHELIA.\nMy lord?\nHAMLET.\nAre you fair?\nOPHELIA.\nWhat means your lordship?\nHAMLET.\nThat if you be honest and fair, your honesty should admit no discourse\nto your beauty.\nOPHELIA.\nCould beauty, my lord, have better commerce than with honesty?\nHAMLET.\nAy, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner transform honesty from\nwhat it is to a bawd than the force of honesty can translate beauty\ninto his likeness. This was sometime a paradox, but now the time gives\nit proof. I did love you once.\nOPHELIA.\nIndeed, my lord, you made me believe so.\nHAMLET.\nYou should not have believed me; for virtue cannot so inoculate our old\nstock but we shall relish of it. I loved you not.\nOPHELIA.\nI was the more deceived.\nHAMLET.\nGet thee to a nunnery. Why wouldst thou be a breeder of sinners? I am\nmyself indifferent honest; but yet I could accuse me of such things\nthat it were better my mother had not borne me. I am very proud,\nrevengeful, ambitious, with more offences at my beck than I have\nthoughts to put them in, imagination to give them shape, or time to act\nthem in. What should such fellows as I do crawling between earth and\nheaven? We are arrant knaves all, believe none of us. Go thy ways to a\nnunnery. Where's your father?\nOPHELIA.\nAt home, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nLet the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the fool nowhere but\nin's own house. Farewell.\nOPHELIA.\nO help him, you sweet heavens!\nHAMLET.\nIf thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for thy dowry. Be thou\nas chaste as ice, as pure as snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get\nthee to a nunnery, go: farewell. Or if thou wilt needs marry, marry a\nfool; for wise men know well enough what monsters you make of them. To\na nunnery, go; and quickly too. Farewell.\nOPHELIA.\nO heavenly powers, restore him!\nHAMLET.\nI have heard of your paintings too, well enough. God hath given you one\nface, and you make yourselves another. You jig, you amble, and you\nlisp, and nickname God's creatures, and make your wantonness your\nignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't, it hath made me mad. I say, we\nwill have no more marriages. Those that are married already, all but\none, shall live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a nunnery, go.\n[_Exit._]\nOPHELIA.\nO, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!\nThe courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword,\nTh'expectancy and rose of the fair state,\nThe glass of fashion and the mould of form,\nTh'observ'd of all observers, quite, quite down!\nAnd I, of ladies most deject and wretched,\nThat suck'd the honey of his music vows,\nNow see that noble and most sovereign reason,\nLike sweet bells jangled out of tune and harsh,\nThat unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth\nBlasted with ecstasy. O woe is me,\nT'have seen what I have seen, see what I see.\nEnter King and Polonius.\nKING.\nLove? His affections do not that way tend,\nNor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,\nWas not like madness. There's something in his soul\nO'er which his melancholy sits on brood,\nAnd I do doubt the hatch and the disclose\nWill be some danger, which for to prevent,\nI have in quick determination\nThus set it down: he shall with speed to England\nFor the demand of our neglected tribute:\nHaply the seas and countries different,\nWith variable objects, shall expel\nThis something settled matter in his heart,\nWhereon his brains still beating puts him thus\nFrom fashion of himself. What think you on't?\nPOLONIUS.\nIt shall do well. But yet do I believe\nThe origin and commencement of his grief\nSprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia?\nYou need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said,\nWe heard it all. My lord, do as you please,\nBut if you hold it fit, after the play,\nLet his queen mother all alone entreat him\nTo show his grief, let her be round with him,\nAnd I'll be plac'd, so please you, in the ear\nOf all their conference. If she find him not,\nTo England send him; or confine him where\nYour wisdom best shall think.\nKING.\nIt shall be so.\nMadness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.\n[_Exeunt._]",

But if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as\nlief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air too much\nwith your hand, thus, but use all gently; for in the very torrent,\ntempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and\nbeget a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the\nsoul to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to\ntatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who, for\nthe most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and\nnoise. I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant. It\nout-Herods Herod. Pray you avoid it.\nFIRST PLAYER.\nI warrant your honour.\nHAMLET.\nBe not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor.\nSuit the action to the word, the word to the action, with this special\nobservance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for anything\nso overdone is from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the\nfirst and now, was and is, to hold as 'twere the mirror up to nature;\nto show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age\nand body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this overdone, or come\ntardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the\njudicious grieve; the censure of the which one must in your allowance\no'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have\nseen play\u2014and heard others praise, and that highly\u2014not to speak it\nprofanely, that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait\nof Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have\nthought some of Nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them\nwell, they imitated humanity so abominably.\nFIRST PLAYER.\nI hope we have reform'd that indifferently with us, sir.\nHAMLET.\nO reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no\nmore than is set down for them. For there be of them that will\nthemselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh\ntoo, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then\nto be considered. That's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition\nin the fool that uses it. Go make you ready.\n[_Exeunt Players._]\nEnter Polonius, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.\nHow now, my lord?\nWill the King hear this piece of work?\nPOLONIUS.\nAnd the Queen too, and that presently.\nHAMLET.\nBid the players make haste.\n[_Exit Polonius._]\nWill you two help to hasten them?\nROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN.\nWe will, my lord.\n[_Exeunt Rosencrantz and Guildenstern._]\nHAMLET.\nWhat ho, Horatio!\nEnter Horatio.\nHORATIO.\nHere, sweet lord, at your service.\nHAMLET.\nHoratio, thou art e'en as just a man\nAs e'er my conversation cop'd withal.\nHORATIO.\nO my dear lord.\nHAMLET.\nNay, do not think I flatter;\nFor what advancement may I hope from thee,\nThat no revenue hast, but thy good spirits\nTo feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?\nNo, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,\nAnd crook the pregnant hinges of the knee\nWhere thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?\nSince my dear soul was mistress of her choice,\nAnd could of men distinguish, her election\nHath seal'd thee for herself. For thou hast been\nAs one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,\nA man that Fortune's buffets and rewards\nHast ta'en with equal thanks. And blessed are those\nWhose blood and judgement are so well co-mingled\nThat they are not a pipe for Fortune's finger\nTo sound what stop she please. Give me that man\nThat is not passion's slave, and I will wear him\nIn my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,\nAs I do thee. Something too much of this.\nThere is a play tonight before the King.\nOne scene of it comes near the circumstance\nWhich I have told thee, of my father's death.\nI prithee, when thou see'st that act a-foot,\nEven with the very comment of thy soul\nObserve mine uncle. If his occulted guilt\nDo not itself unkennel in one speech,\nIt is a damned ghost that we have seen;\nAnd my imaginations are as foul\nAs Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;\nFor I mine eyes will rivet to his face;\nAnd after we will both our judgements join\nIn censure of his seeming.\nHORATIO.\nWell, my lord.\nIf he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,\nAnd 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.\nHAMLET.\nThey are coming to the play. I must be idle.\nGet you a place.\nDanish march. A flourish. Enter King, Queen, Polonius, Ophelia,\nRosencrantz, Guildenstern and others.\nKING.\nHow fares our cousin Hamlet?\nHAMLET.\nExcellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat the air,\npromise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.\nKING.\nI have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine.\nHAMLET.\nNo, nor mine now. [_To Polonius._] My lord, you play'd once i'\nth'university, you say?\nPOLONIUS.\nThat did I, my lord, and was accounted a good actor.\nHAMLET.\nWhat did you enact?\nPOLONIUS.\nI did enact Julius Caesar. I was kill'd i' th' Capitol. Brutus killed\nme.\nHAMLET.\nIt was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there. Be the\nplayers ready?\nROSENCRANTZ.\nAy, my lord; they stay upon your patience.\nQUEEN.\nCome hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.\nHAMLET.\nNo, good mother, here's metal more attractive.\nPOLONIUS.\n[_To the King._] O ho! do you mark that?\nHAMLET.\nLady, shall I lie in your lap?\n[_Lying down at Ophelia's feet._]\nOPHELIA.\nNo, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI mean, my head upon your lap?\nOPHELIA.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nDo you think I meant country matters?\nOPHELIA.\nI think nothing, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nThat's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.\nOPHELIA.\nWhat is, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nNothing.\nOPHELIA.\nYou are merry, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWho, I?\nOPHELIA.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nO God, your only jig-maker! What should a man do but be merry? For look\nyou how cheerfully my mother looks, and my father died within's two\nhours.\nOPHELIA.\nNay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nSo long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for I'll have a suit of\nsables. O heavens! die two months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then\nthere's hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half a year. But\nby'r lady, he must build churches then; or else shall he suffer not\nthinking on, with the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for O, the\nhobby-horse is forgot!'\nTrumpets sound. The dumb show enters.\n_Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him and he\nher. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her\nup, and declines his head upon her neck. Lays him down upon a bank of\nflowers. She, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow,\ntakes off his crown, kisses it, pours poison in the King's ears, and\nexits. The Queen returns, finds the King dead, and makes passionate\naction. The Poisoner with some three or four Mutes, comes in again,\nseeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner\nwoos the Queen with gifts. She seems loth and unwilling awhile, but in\nthe end accepts his love._\n[_Exeunt._]\nOPHELIA.\nWhat means this, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nMarry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.\nOPHELIA.\nBelike this show imports the argument of the play.\nEnter Prologue.\nHAMLET.\nWe shall know by this fellow: the players cannot keep counsel; they'll\ntell all.\nOPHELIA.\nWill they tell us what this show meant?\nHAMLET.\nAy, or any show that you'll show him. Be not you ashamed to show, he'll\nnot shame to tell you what it means.\nOPHELIA.\nYou are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.\nPROLOGUE.\n_For us, and for our tragedy,\nHere stooping to your clemency,\nWe beg your hearing patiently._\nHAMLET.\nIs this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?\nOPHELIA.\n'Tis brief, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nAs woman's love.\nEnter a King and a Queen.\nPLAYER KING.\nFull thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round\nNeptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,\nAnd thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen\nAbout the world have times twelve thirties been,\nSince love our hearts, and Hymen did our hands\nUnite commutual in most sacred bands.\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nSo many journeys may the sun and moon\nMake us again count o'er ere love be done.\nBut, woe is me, you are so sick of late,\nSo far from cheer and from your former state,\nThat I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,\nDiscomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:\nFor women's fear and love holds quantity,\nIn neither aught, or in extremity.\nNow what my love is, proof hath made you know,\nAnd as my love is siz'd, my fear is so.\nWhere love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;\nWhere little fears grow great, great love grows there.\nPLAYER KING.\nFaith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too:\nMy operant powers their functions leave to do:\nAnd thou shalt live in this fair world behind,\nHonour'd, belov'd, and haply one as kind\nFor husband shalt thou\u2014\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nO confound the rest.\nSuch love must needs be treason in my breast.\nIn second husband let me be accurst!\nNone wed the second but who kill'd the first.\nHAMLET.\n[_Aside._] Wormwood, wormwood.\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nThe instances that second marriage move\nAre base respects of thrift, but none of love.\nA second time I kill my husband dead,\nWhen second husband kisses me in bed.\nPLAYER KING.\nI do believe you think what now you speak;\nBut what we do determine, oft we break.\nPurpose is but the slave to memory,\nOf violent birth, but poor validity:\nWhich now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree,\nBut fall unshaken when they mellow be.\nMost necessary 'tis that we forget\nTo pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt.\nWhat to ourselves in passion we propose,\nThe passion ending, doth the purpose lose.\nThe violence of either grief or joy\nTheir own enactures with themselves destroy.\nWhere joy most revels, grief doth most lament;\nGrief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.\nThis world is not for aye; nor 'tis not strange\nThat even our loves should with our fortunes change,\nFor 'tis a question left us yet to prove,\nWhether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.\nThe great man down, you mark his favourite flies,\nThe poor advanc'd makes friends of enemies;\nAnd hitherto doth love on fortune tend:\nFor who not needs shall never lack a friend,\nAnd who in want a hollow friend doth try,\nDirectly seasons him his enemy.\nBut orderly to end where I begun,\nOur wills and fates do so contrary run\nThat our devices still are overthrown.\nOur thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own.\nSo think thou wilt no second husband wed,\nBut die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nNor earth to me give food, nor heaven light,\nSport and repose lock from me day and night,\nTo desperation turn my trust and hope,\nAn anchor's cheer in prison be my scope,\nEach opposite that blanks the face of joy,\nMeet what I would have well, and it destroy!\nBoth here and hence pursue me lasting strife,\nIf, once a widow, ever I be wife.\nHAMLET.\n[_To Ophelia._] If she should break it now.\nPLAYER KING.\n'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile.\nMy spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile\nThe tedious day with sleep.\n[_Sleeps._]\nPLAYER QUEEN.\nSleep rock thy brain,\nAnd never come mischance between us twain.\n[_Exit._]\nHAMLET.\nMadam, how like you this play?\nQUEEN.\nThe lady protests too much, methinks.\nHAMLET.\nO, but she'll keep her word.\nKING.\nHave you heard the argument? Is there no offence in't?\nHAMLET.\nNo, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence i' th' world.\nKING.\nWhat do you call the play?\nHAMLET.\n_The Mousetrap._ Marry, how? Tropically. This play is the image of a\nmurder done in Vienna. Gonzago is the Duke's name, his wife Baptista:\nyou shall see anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o' that?\nYour majesty, and we that have free souls, it touches us not. Let the\ngall'd jade wince; our withers are unwrung.\nEnter Lucianus.\nThis is one Lucianus, nephew to the King.\nOPHELIA.\nYou are a good chorus, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nI could interpret between you and your love, if I could see the puppets\ndallying.\nOPHELIA.\nYou are keen, my lord, you are keen.\nHAMLET.\nIt would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.\nOPHELIA.\nStill better, and worse.\nHAMLET.\nSo you mistake your husbands.\u2014Begin, murderer. Pox, leave thy damnable\nfaces, and begin. Come, the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.\nLUCIANUS.\nThoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing,\nConfederate season, else no creature seeing;\nThou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,\nWith Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,\nThy natural magic and dire property\nOn wholesome life usurp immediately.\n[_Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears._]\nHAMLET.\nHe poisons him i' th'garden for's estate. His name's Gonzago. The story\nis extant, and written in very choice Italian. You shall see anon how\nthe murderer gets the love of Gonzago's wife.\nOPHELIA.\nThe King rises.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, frighted with false fire?\nQUEEN.\nHow fares my lord?\nPOLONIUS.\nGive o'er the play.\nKING.\nGive me some light. Away.\nAll.\nLights, lights, lights.\n[_Exeunt all but Hamlet and Horatio._]",

Forgive me my foul murder!\nThat cannot be; since I am still possess'd\nOf those effects for which I did the murder,\u2014\nMy crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.\nMay one be pardon'd and retain th'offence?\nIn the corrupted currents of this world\nOffence's gilded hand may shove by justice,\nAnd oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself\nBuys out the law. But 'tis not so above;\nThere is no shuffling, there the action lies\nIn his true nature, and we ourselves compell'd\nEven to the teeth and forehead of our faults,\nTo give in evidence. What then? What rests?\nTry what repentance can. What can it not?\nYet what can it, when one cannot repent?\nO wretched state! O bosom black as death!\nO limed soul, that struggling to be free,\nArt more engag'd! Help, angels! Make assay:\nBow, stubborn knees; and heart with strings of steel,\nBe soft as sinews of the new-born babe.\nAll may be well.\n[_Retires and kneels._]\nEnter Hamlet.\nHAMLET.\nNow might I do it pat, now he is praying.\nAnd now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;\nAnd so am I reveng'd. That would be scann'd:\nA villain kills my father, and for that\nI, his sole son, do this same villain send\nTo heaven. O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.\nHe took my father grossly, full of bread,\nWith all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;\nAnd how his audit stands, who knows save heaven?\nBut in our circumstance and course of thought,\n'Tis heavy with him. And am I then reveng'd,\nTo take him in the purging of his soul,\nWhen he is fit and season'd for his passage? No.\nUp, sword, and know thou a more horrid hent:\nWhen he is drunk asleep; or in his rage,\nOr in th'incestuous pleasure of his bed,\nAt gaming, swearing; or about some act\nThat has no relish of salvation in't,\nThen trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,\nAnd that his soul may be as damn'd and black\nAs hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays.\nThis physic but prolongs thy sickly days.\n[_Exit._]\nThe King rises and advances.\nKING.\nMy words fly up, my thoughts remain below.\nWords without thoughts never to heaven go.\n[_Exit._]\nSCENE IV.

Go a little before.\n[_Exeunt all but Hamlet._]\nHow all occasions do inform against me,\nAnd spur my dull revenge. What is a man\nIf his chief good and market of his time\nBe but to sleep and feed? A beast, no more.\nSure he that made us with such large discourse,\nLooking before and after, gave us not\nThat capability and godlike reason\nTo fust in us unus'd. Now whether it be\nBestial oblivion, or some craven scruple\nOf thinking too precisely on th'event,\u2014\nA thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom\nAnd ever three parts coward,\u2014I do not know\nWhy yet I live to say this thing's to do,\nSith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means\nTo do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me,\nWitness this army of such mass and charge,\nLed by a delicate and tender prince,\nWhose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,\nMakes mouths at the invisible event,\nExposing what is mortal and unsure\nTo all that fortune, death, and danger dare,\nEven for an eggshell. Rightly to be great\nIs not to stir without great argument,\nBut greatly to find quarrel in a straw\nWhen honour's at the stake. How stand I then,\nThat have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,\nExcitements of my reason and my blood,\nAnd let all sleep, while to my shame I see\nThe imminent death of twenty thousand men\nThat, for a fantasy and trick of fame,\nGo to their graves like beds, fight for a plot\nWhereon the numbers cannot try the cause,\nWhich is not tomb enough and continent\nTo hide the slain? O, from this time forth,\nMy thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth.\n[_Exit._]",

Poor Ophelia\nDivided from herself and her fair judgement,\nWithout the which we are pictures or mere beasts.\nLast, and as much containing as all these,\nHer brother is in secret come from France,\nFeeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,\nAnd wants not buzzers to infect his ear\nWith pestilent speeches of his father's death,\nWherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,\nWill nothing stick our person to arraign\nIn ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,\nLike to a murdering piece, in many places\nGives me superfluous death.\n[_A noise within._]\nQUEEN.\nAlack, what noise is this?\nKING.\nWhere are my Switzers?

Laertes shall be king!'\nCaps, hands, and tongues applaud it to the clouds,\n'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king.'\nQUEEN.\nHow cheerfully on the false trail they cry.\nO, this is counter, you false Danish dogs.\n[_A noise within._]\nKING.\nThe doors are broke.\nEnter Laertes, armed; Danes following.\nLAERTES.\nWhere is this king?\u2014Sirs, stand you all without.\nDanes.\nNo, let's come in.\nLAERTES.\nI pray you, give me leave.\nDANES.\nWe will, we will.\n[_They retire without the door._]\nLAERTES.\nI thank you.

Do not fear our person.\nThere's such divinity doth hedge a king,\nThat treason can but peep to what it would,\nActs little of his will.\u2014Tell me, Laertes,\nWhy thou art thus incens'd.\u2014Let him go, Gertrude:\u2014\nSpeak, man.\nLAERTES.\nWhere is my father?\nKING.\nDead.\nQUEEN.\nBut not by him.\nKING.\nLet him demand his fill.\nLAERTES.\nHow came he dead? I'll not be juggled with.\nTo hell, allegiance! Vows, to the blackest devil!\nConscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!\nI dare damnation. To this point I stand,\nThat both the worlds, I give to negligence,\nLet come what comes; only I'll be reveng'd\nMost throughly for my father.\nKING.\nWho shall stay you?\nLAERTES.\nMy will, not all the world.\nAnd for my means, I'll husband them so well,\nThey shall go far with little.\nKING.\nGood Laertes,\nIf you desire to know the certainty\nOf your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge\nThat, sweepstake, you will draw both friend and foe,\nWinner and loser?\nLAERTES.\nNone but his enemies.\nKING.\nWill you know them then?\nLAERTES.\nTo his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;\nAnd, like the kind life-rendering pelican,\nRepast them with my blood.\nKING.\nWhy, now you speak\nLike a good child and a true gentleman.\nThat I am guiltless of your father's death,\nAnd am most sensibly in grief for it,\nIt shall as level to your judgement 'pear\nAs day does to your eye.\nDANES.\n[_Within._] Let her come in.\nLAERTES.\nHow now! What noise is that?\nRe-enter Ophelia, fantastically dressed with straws and flowers.\nO heat, dry up my brains. Tears seven times salt,\nBurn out the sense and virtue of mine eye.\nBy heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,\nTill our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!\nDear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!\nO heavens, is't possible a young maid's wits\nShould be as mortal as an old man's life?\nNature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,\nIt sends some precious instance of itself\nAfter the thing it loves.\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nThey bore him barefac'd on the bier,\nHey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny\nAnd on his grave rain'd many a tear.\u2014\nFare you well, my dove!\nLAERTES.\nHadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,\nIt could not move thus.\nOPHELIA.\nYou must sing 'Down a-down, and you call him a-down-a.' O, how the\nwheel becomes it! It is the false steward that stole his master's\ndaughter.\nLAERTES.\nThis nothing's more than matter.\nOPHELIA.\nThere's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray love, remember. And\nthere is pansies, that's for thoughts.\nLAERTES.\nA document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.\nOPHELIA.\nThere's fennel for you, and columbines. There's rue for you; and here's\nsome for me. We may call it herb of grace o' Sundays. O you must wear\nyour rue with a difference. There's a daisy. I would give you some\nviolets, but they wither'd all when my father died. They say he made a\ngood end.\n[_Sings._]\nFor bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.\nLAERTES.\nThought and affliction, passion, hell itself\nShe turns to favour and to prettiness.\nOPHELIA.\n[_Sings._]\nAnd will he not come again?\nAnd will he not come again?\nNo, no, he is dead,\nGo to thy death-bed,\nHe never will come again.\nHis beard was as white as snow,\nAll flaxen was his poll.\nHe is gone, he is gone,\nAnd we cast away moan.\nGod ha' mercy on his soul.\nAnd of all Christian souls, I pray God. God b' wi' ye.\n[_Exit._]\nLAERTES.\nDo you see this, O God?\nKING.\nLaertes, I must commune with your grief,\nOr you deny me right. Go but apart,\nMake choice of whom your wisest friends you will,\nAnd they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me.\nIf by direct or by collateral hand\nThey find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,\nOur crown, our life, and all that we call ours\nTo you in satisfaction; but if not,\nBe you content to lend your patience to us,\nAnd we shall jointly labour with your soul\nTo give it due content.\nLAERTES.\nLet this be so;\nHis means of death, his obscure burial,\u2014\nNo trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,\nNo noble rite, nor formal ostentation,\u2014\nCry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,\nThat I must call't in question.\nKING.\nSo you shall.\nAnd where th'offence is let the great axe fall.\nI pray you go with me.",

Another room in the Castle.\nEnter King and Laertes.\nKING.\nNow must your conscience my acquittance seal,\nAnd you must put me in your heart for friend,\nSith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,\nThat he which hath your noble father slain\nPursu'd my life.\nLAERTES.\nIt well appears. But tell me\nWhy you proceeded not against these feats,\nSo crimeful and so capital in nature,\nAs by your safety, wisdom, all things else,\nYou mainly were stirr'd up.\nKING.\nO, for two special reasons,\nWhich may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,\nBut yet to me they are strong. The Queen his mother\nLives almost by his looks; and for myself,\u2014\nMy virtue or my plague, be it either which,\u2014\nShe's so conjunctive to my life and soul,\nThat, as the star moves not but in his sphere,\nI could not but by her. The other motive,\nWhy to a public count I might not go,\nIs the great love the general gender bear him,\nWho, dipping all his faults in their affection,\nWould like the spring that turneth wood to stone,\nConvert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,\nToo slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,\nWould have reverted to my bow again,\nAnd not where I had aim'd them.\nLAERTES.\nAnd so have I a noble father lost,\nA sister driven into desperate terms,\nWhose worth, if praises may go back again,\nStood challenger on mount of all the age\nFor her perfections. But my revenge will come.\nKING.\nBreak not your sleeps for that. You must not think\nThat we are made of stuff so flat and dull\nThat we can let our beard be shook with danger,\nAnd think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more.\nI lov'd your father, and we love ourself,\nAnd that, I hope, will teach you to imagine\u2014\nEnter a Messenger.\nHow now? What news?\nMESSENGER.\nLetters, my lord, from Hamlet.\nThis to your Majesty; this to the Queen.\nKING.\nFrom Hamlet! Who brought them?\nMESSENGER.\nSailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not.\nThey were given me by Claudio. He receiv'd them\nOf him that brought them.\nKING.\nLaertes, you shall hear them.\nLeave us.\n[_Exit Messenger._]\n[_Reads._] 'High and mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your\nkingdom. Tomorrow shall I beg leave to see your kingly eyes. When I\nshall, first asking your pardon thereunto, recount the occasions of my\nsudden and more strange return.\nHAMLET.'\nWhat should this mean? Are all the rest come back?\nOr is it some abuse, and no such thing?\nLAERTES.\nKnow you the hand?\nKING.\n'Tis Hamlet's character. 'Naked!'\nAnd in a postscript here he says 'alone.'\nCan you advise me?\nLAERTES.\nI am lost in it, my lord. But let him come,\nIt warms the very sickness in my heart\nThat I shall live and tell him to his teeth,\n'Thus diest thou.'\nKING.\nIf it be so, Laertes,\u2014\nAs how should it be so? How otherwise?\u2014\nWill you be rul'd by me?\nLAERTES.\nAy, my lord;\nSo you will not o'errule me to a peace.\nKING.\nTo thine own peace. If he be now return'd,\nAs checking at his voyage, and that he means\nNo more to undertake it, I will work him\nTo an exploit, now ripe in my device,\nUnder the which he shall not choose but fall;\nAnd for his death no wind shall breathe,\nBut even his mother shall uncharge the practice\nAnd call it accident.\nLAERTES.\nMy lord, I will be rul'd;\nThe rather if you could devise it so\nThat I might be the organ.\nKING.\nIt falls right.\nYou have been talk'd of since your travel much,\nAnd that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality\nWherein they say you shine. Your sum of parts\nDid not together pluck such envy from him\nAs did that one, and that, in my regard,\nOf the unworthiest siege.\nLAERTES.\nWhat part is that, my lord?\nKING.\nA very riband in the cap of youth,\nYet needful too, for youth no less becomes\nThe light and careless livery that it wears\nThan settled age his sables and his weeds,\nImporting health and graveness. Two months since\nHere was a gentleman of Normandy,\u2014\nI've seen myself, and serv'd against, the French,\nAnd they can well on horseback, but this gallant\nHad witchcraft in't. He grew unto his seat,\nAnd to such wondrous doing brought his horse,\nAs had he been incorps'd and demi-natur'd\nWith the brave beast. So far he topp'd my thought\nThat I in forgery of shapes and tricks,\nCome short of what he did.\nLAERTES.\nA Norman was't?\nKING.\nA Norman.\nLAERTES.\nUpon my life, Lamord.\nKING.\nThe very same.\nLAERTES.\nI know him well. He is the brooch indeed\nAnd gem of all the nation.\nKING.\nHe made confession of you,\nAnd gave you such a masterly report\nFor art and exercise in your defence,\nAnd for your rapier most especially,\nThat he cried out 'twould be a sight indeed\nIf one could match you. The scrimers of their nation\nHe swore had neither motion, guard, nor eye,\nIf you oppos'd them. Sir, this report of his\nDid Hamlet so envenom with his envy\nThat he could nothing do but wish and beg\nYour sudden coming o'er to play with him.\nNow, out of this,\u2014\nLAERTES.\nWhat out of this, my lord?\nKING.\nLaertes, was your father dear to you?\nOr are you like the painting of a sorrow,\nA face without a heart?\nLAERTES.\nWhy ask you this?\nKING.\nNot that I think you did not love your father,\nBut that I know love is begun by time,\nAnd that I see, in passages of proof,\nTime qualifies the spark and fire of it.\nThere lives within the very flame of love\nA kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;\nAnd nothing is at a like goodness still,\nFor goodness, growing to a pleurisy,\nDies in his own too much. That we would do,\nWe should do when we would; for this 'would' changes,\nAnd hath abatements and delays as many\nAs there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;\nAnd then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh\nThat hurts by easing. But to the quick o' th'ulcer:\nHamlet comes back: what would you undertake\nTo show yourself your father's son in deed,\nMore than in words?\nLAERTES.\nTo cut his throat i' th' church.\nKING.\nNo place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;\nRevenge should have no bounds. But good Laertes,\nWill you do this, keep close within your chamber.\nHamlet return'd shall know you are come home:\nWe'll put on those shall praise your excellence,\nAnd set a double varnish on the fame\nThe Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together\nAnd wager on your heads. He, being remiss,\nMost generous, and free from all contriving,\nWill not peruse the foils; so that with ease,\nOr with a little shuffling, you may choose\nA sword unbated, and in a pass of practice,\nRequite him for your father.\nLAERTES.\nI will do't.\nAnd for that purpose I'll anoint my sword.\nI bought an unction of a mountebank\nSo mortal that, but dip a knife in it,\nWhere it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,\nCollected from all simples that have virtue\nUnder the moon, can save the thing from death\nThis is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point\nWith this contagion, that if I gall him slightly,\nIt may be death.\nKING.\nLet's further think of this,\nWeigh what convenience both of time and means\nMay fit us to our shape. If this should fail,\nAnd that our drift look through our bad performance.\n'Twere better not assay'd. Therefore this project\nShould have a back or second, that might hold\nIf this did blast in proof. Soft, let me see.\nWe'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings,\u2014\nI ha't! When in your motion you are hot and dry,\nAs make your bouts more violent to that end,\nAnd that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him\nA chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping,\nIf he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,\nOur purpose may hold there.\nEnter Queen.\nHow now, sweet Queen?\nQUEEN.\nOne woe doth tread upon another's heel,\nSo fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes.\nLAERTES.\nDrown'd! O, where?\nQUEEN.\nThere is a willow grows aslant a brook,\nThat shows his hoary leaves in the glassy stream.\nThere with fantastic garlands did she make\nOf crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples,\nThat liberal shepherds give a grosser name,\nBut our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them.\nThere on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds\nClamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke,\nWhen down her weedy trophies and herself\nFell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide,\nAnd mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up,\nWhich time she chaunted snatches of old tunes,\nAs one incapable of her own distress,\nOr like a creature native and indued\nUnto that element. But long it could not be\nTill that her garments, heavy with their drink,\nPull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay\nTo muddy death.\nLAERTES.\nAlas, then she is drown'd?\nQUEEN.\nDrown'd, drown'd.\nLAERTES.\nToo much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,\nAnd therefore I forbid my tears. But yet\nIt is our trick; nature her custom holds,\nLet shame say what it will. When these are gone,\nThe woman will be out. Adieu, my lord,\nI have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,\nBut that this folly douts it.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nLet's follow, Gertrude;\nHow much I had to do to calm his rage!\nNow fear I this will give it start again;\nTherefore let's follow.\n[_Exeunt._]",

A churchyard.\nEnter two Clowns with spades, &c.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nIs she to be buried in Christian burial, when she wilfully seeks her\nown salvation?\nSECOND CLOWN.\nI tell thee she is, and therefore make her grave straight. The crowner\nhath sat on her, and finds it Christian burial.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nHow can that be, unless she drowned herself in her own defence?\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWhy, 'tis found so.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nIt must be _se offendendo_, it cannot be else. For here lies the point:\nif I drown myself wittingly, it argues an act: and an act hath three\nbranches. It is to act, to do, and to perform: argal, she drowned\nherself wittingly.\nSECOND CLOWN.\nNay, but hear you, goodman delver,\u2014\nFIRST CLOWN.\nGive me leave. Here lies the water; good. Here stands the man; good. If\nthe man go to this water and drown himself, it is, will he nill he, he\ngoes,\u2014mark you that. But if the water come to him and drown him, he\ndrowns not himself.

If this had not been a gentlewoman, she\nshould have been buried out o' Christian burial.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, there thou say'st. And the more pity that great folk should have\ncountenance in this world to drown or hang themselves more than their\neven Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient gentlemen but\ngardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers: they hold up Adam's profession.\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWas he a gentleman?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nHe was the first that ever bore arms.\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWhy, he had none.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhat, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the Scripture? The\nScripture says Adam digg'd. Could he dig without arms? I'll put another\nquestion to thee. If thou answerest me not to the purpose, confess\nthyself\u2014\nSECOND CLOWN.\nGo to.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhat is he that builds stronger than either the mason, the shipwright,\nor the carpenter?\nSECOND CLOWN.\nThe gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a thousand tenants.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nI like thy wit well in good faith, the gallows does well. But how does\nit well? It does well to those that do ill. Now, thou dost ill to say\nthe gallows is built stronger than the church; argal, the gallows may\ndo well to thee. To't again, come.\nSECOND CLOWN.\nWho builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or a carpenter?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nAy, tell me that, and unyoke.\nSECOND CLOWN.\nMarry, now I can tell.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nTo't.\nSECOND CLOWN.\nMass, I cannot tell.\nEnter Hamlet and Horatio, at a distance.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nCudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull ass will not mend his\npace with beating; and when you are asked this question next, say 'a\ngrave-maker'. The houses he makes last till doomsday. Go, get thee to\nYaughan; fetch me a stoup of liquor.\n[_Exit Second Clown._]\n[_Digs and sings._]\nIn youth when I did love, did love,\nMethought it was very sweet;\nTo contract, O, the time for, a, my behove,\nO methought there was nothing meet.\nHAMLET.\nHas this fellow no feeling of his business, that he sings at\ngrave-making?\nHORATIO.\nCustom hath made it in him a property of easiness.\nHAMLET.\n'Tis e'en so; the hand of little employment hath the daintier sense.\nFIRST CLOWN.\n[_Sings._]\nBut age with his stealing steps\nHath claw'd me in his clutch,\nAnd hath shipp'd me into the land,\nAs if I had never been such.\n[_Throws up a skull._]\nHAMLET.\nThat skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once. How the knave jowls\nit to th' ground, as if 'twere Cain's jawbone, that did the first\nmurder! This might be the pate of a politician which this ass now\no'er-offices, one that would circumvent God, might it not?\nHORATIO.\nIt might, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nOr of a courtier, which could say 'Good morrow, sweet lord! How dost\nthou, good lord?' This might be my lord such-a-one, that praised my\nlord such-a-one's horse when he meant to beg it, might it not?\nHORATIO.\nAy, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nWhy, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and knocked about the\nmazard with a sexton's spade. Here's fine revolution, an we had the\ntrick to see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding but to play\nat loggets with 'em? Mine ache to think on't.\nFIRST CLOWN.\n[_Sings._]\nA pickaxe and a spade, a spade,\nFor and a shrouding-sheet;\nO, a pit of clay for to be made\nFor such a guest is meet.\n[_Throws up another skull._]\nHAMLET.\nThere's another. Why may not that be the skull of a lawyer? Where be\nhis quiddits now, his quillets, his cases, his tenures, and his tricks?\nWhy does he suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the sconce\nwith a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of his action of battery?\nHum. This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of land, with his\nstatutes, his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, his\nrecoveries. Is this the fine of his fines, and the recovery of his\nrecoveries, to have his fine pate full of fine dirt? Will his vouchers\nvouch him no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than the\nlength and breadth of a pair of indentures? The very conveyances of his\nlands will scarcely lie in this box; and must the inheritor himself\nhave no more, ha?\nHORATIO.\nNot a jot more, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nIs not parchment made of sheep-skins?\nHORATIO.\nAy, my lord, and of calf-skins too.\nHAMLET.\nThey are sheep and calves which seek out assurance in that. I will\nspeak to this fellow.\u2014Whose grave's this, sir?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nMine, sir.\n[_Sings._]\nO, a pit of clay for to be made\nFor such a guest is meet.\nHAMLET.\nI think it be thine indeed, for thou liest in't.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nYou lie out on't, sir, and therefore 'tis not yours.\nFor my part, I do not lie in't, yet it is mine.\nHAMLET.\nThou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine. 'Tis for the dead,\nnot for the quick; therefore thou liest.\nFIRST CLOWN.\n'Tis a quick lie, sir; 't will away again from me to you.\nHAMLET.\nWhat man dost thou dig it for?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFor no man, sir.\nHAMLET.\nWhat woman then?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFor none neither.\nHAMLET.\nWho is to be buried in't?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nOne that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.\nHAMLET.\nHow absolute the knave is! We must speak by the card, or equivocation\nwill undo us. By the Lord, Horatio, these three years I have taken note\nof it, the age is grown so picked that the toe of the peasant comes so\nnear the heel of the courtier he galls his kibe.\u2014How long hast thou\nbeen a grave-maker?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nOf all the days i' th' year, I came to't that day that our last King\nHamlet o'ercame Fortinbras.\nHAMLET.\nHow long is that since?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nCannot you tell that? Every fool can tell that. It was the very day\nthat young Hamlet was born,\u2014he that is mad, and sent into England.\nHAMLET.\nAy, marry, why was he sent into England?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, because he was mad; he shall recover his wits there; or if he do\nnot, it's no great matter there.\nHAMLET.\nWhy?\nFIRST CLOWN.\n'Twill not be seen in him there; there the men are as mad as he.\nHAMLET.\nHow came he mad?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nVery strangely, they say.\nHAMLET.\nHow strangely?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFaith, e'en with losing his wits.\nHAMLET.\nUpon what ground?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, here in Denmark. I have been sexton here, man and boy, thirty\nyears.\nHAMLET.\nHow long will a man lie i' th'earth ere he rot?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nFaith, if he be not rotten before he die,\u2014as we have many pocky corses\nnowadays that will scarce hold the laying in,\u2014he will last you some\neight year or nine year. A tanner will last you nine year.\nHAMLET.\nWhy he more than another?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nWhy, sir, his hide is so tann'd with his trade that he will keep out\nwater a great while. And your water is a sore decayer of your whoreson\ndead body. Here's a skull now; this skull hath lain in the earth\nthree-and-twenty years.\nHAMLET.\nWhose was it?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nA whoreson, mad fellow's it was. Whose do you think it was?\nHAMLET.\nNay, I know not.\nFIRST CLOWN.\nA pestilence on him for a mad rogue! A pour'd a flagon of Rhenish on my\nhead once. This same skull, sir, was Yorick's skull, the King's jester.\nHAMLET.\nThis?\nFIRST CLOWN.\nE'en that.\nHAMLET.\nLet me see. [_Takes the skull._] Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him,\nHoratio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath\nborne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my\nimagination it is! My gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I\nhave kiss'd I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your gambols?\nyour songs? your flashes of merriment, that were wont to set the table\non a roar? Not one now, to mock your own grinning? Quite chop-fallen?\nNow get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch\nthick, to this favour she must come. Make her laugh at that.\u2014Prithee,\nHoratio, tell me one thing.\nHORATIO.\nWhat's that, my lord?\nHAMLET.\nDost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i' th'earth?\nHORATIO.\nE'en so.\nHAMLET.\nAnd smelt so? Pah!\n[_Throws down the skull._]\nHORATIO.\nE'en so, my lord.\nHAMLET.\nTo what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may not imagination trace\nthe noble dust of Alexander till he find it stopping a bung-hole?\nHORATIO.\n'Twere to consider too curiously to consider so.\nHAMLET.\nNo, faith, not a jot. But to follow him thither with modesty enough,\nand likelihood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died, Alexander was\nburied, Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we\nmake loam; and why of that loam whereto he was converted might they not\nstop a beer-barrel?\nImperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,\nMight stop a hole to keep the wind away.\nO, that that earth which kept the world in awe\nShould patch a wall t'expel the winter's flaw.\nBut soft! but soft! aside! Here comes the King.\nEnter priests, &c, in procession; the corpse of Ophelia, Laertes and\nMourners following; King, Queen, their Trains, &c.\nThe Queen, the courtiers. Who is that they follow?\nAnd with such maimed rites? This doth betoken\nThe corse they follow did with desperate hand\nFordo it own life. 'Twas of some estate.\nCouch we awhile and mark.\n[_Retiring with Horatio._]\nLAERTES.\nWhat ceremony else?\nHAMLET.\nThat is Laertes, a very noble youth. Mark.\nLAERTES.\nWhat ceremony else?\nPRIEST.\nHer obsequies have been as far enlarg'd\nAs we have warranties. Her death was doubtful;\nAnd but that great command o'ersways the order,\nShe should in ground unsanctified have lodg'd\nTill the last trumpet. For charitable prayers,\nShards, flints, and pebbles should be thrown on her.\nYet here she is allowed her virgin rites,\nHer maiden strewments, and the bringing home\nOf bell and burial.\nLAERTES.\nMust there no more be done?\nPRIEST.\nNo more be done.\nWe should profane the service of the dead\nTo sing sage requiem and such rest to her\nAs to peace-parted souls.\nLAERTES.\nLay her i' th'earth,\nAnd from her fair and unpolluted flesh\nMay violets spring. I tell thee, churlish priest,\nA minist'ring angel shall my sister be\nWhen thou liest howling.\nHAMLET.\nWhat, the fair Ophelia?\nQUEEN.\n[_Scattering flowers._] Sweets to the sweet. Farewell.\nI hop'd thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;\nI thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,\nAnd not have strew'd thy grave.\nLAERTES.\nO, treble woe\nFall ten times treble on that cursed head\nWhose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense\nDepriv'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while,\nTill I have caught her once more in mine arms.\n[_Leaps into the grave._]\nNow pile your dust upon the quick and dead,\nTill of this flat a mountain you have made,\nTo o'ertop old Pelion or the skyish head\nOf blue Olympus.\nHAMLET.\n[_Advancing._]\nWhat is he whose grief\nBears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow\nConjures the wand'ring stars, and makes them stand\nLike wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,\nHamlet the Dane.\n[_Leaps into the grave._]\nLAERTES.\n[_Grappling with him._] The devil take thy soul!\nHAMLET.\nThou pray'st not well.\nI prithee take thy fingers from my throat;\nFor though I am not splenative and rash,\nYet have I in me something dangerous,\nWhich let thy wiseness fear. Away thy hand!\nKING.\nPluck them asunder.\nQUEEN.\nHamlet! Hamlet!\nAll.\nGentlemen!\nHORATIO.\nGood my lord, be quiet.\n[_The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave._]\nHAMLET.\nWhy, I will fight with him upon this theme\nUntil my eyelids will no longer wag.\nQUEEN.\nO my son, what theme?\nHAMLET.\nI lov'd Ophelia; forty thousand brothers\nCould not, with all their quantity of love,\nMake up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?\nKING.\nO, he is mad, Laertes.\nQUEEN.\nFor love of God forbear him!\nHAMLET.\n'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:\nWoul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?\nWoul't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?\nI'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?\nTo outface me with leaping in her grave?\nBe buried quick with her, and so will I.\nAnd if thou prate of mountains, let them throw\nMillions of acres on us, till our ground,\nSingeing his pate against the burning zone,\nMake Ossa like a wart. Nay, an thou'lt mouth,\nI'll rant as well as thou.\nQUEEN.\nThis is mere madness:\nAnd thus awhile the fit will work on him;\nAnon, as patient as the female dove,\nWhen that her golden couplets are disclos'd,\nHis silence will sit drooping.\nHAMLET.\nHear you, sir;\nWhat is the reason that you use me thus?\nI lov'd you ever. But it is no matter.\nLet Hercules himself do what he may,\nThe cat will mew, and dog will have his day.\n[_Exit._]\nKING.\nI pray thee, good Horatio, wait upon him.\n[_Exit Horatio._]\n[_To Laertes_]\nStrengthen your patience in our last night's speech;\nWe'll put the matter to the present push.\u2014\nGood Gertrude, set some watch over your son.\nThis grave shall have a living monument.\nAn hour of quiet shortly shall we see;\nTill then in patience our proceeding be.\n[_Exeunt._]\nSCENE II.
