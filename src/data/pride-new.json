      "text": "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession\nof a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\nHowever little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his\nfirst entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds\nof the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful\nproperty of some one or other of their daughters.\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" said his lady to him one day, \"have you heard that\nNetherfield Park is let at last?\"\nMr. Bennet replied that he had not.\n\"But it is,\" returned she; \"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she\ntold me all about it.\"\nMr. Bennet made no answer.\n\"Do not you want to know who has taken it?\" cried his wife impatiently.\n\"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.\"\nThis was invitation enough.\n\"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken\nby a young man of large fortune from the north of England; that he came\ndown on Monday in a chaise and four to see the place, and was so much\ndelighted with it that he agreed with Mr. Morris immediately; that he is\nto take possession before Michaelmas, and some of his servants are to be\nin the house by the end of next week.\"\n\"What is his name?\"\n\"Bingley.\"\n\"Is he married or single?\"\n\"Oh! single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four\nor five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\"How so? how can it affect them?\"\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You\nmust know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\"Design! nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he\n_may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as\nsoon as he comes.\"\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send\nthem by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are\nas handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley might like you the best of the\nparty.\"\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of beauty, but\nI do not pretend to be any thing extraordinary now. When a woman has\nfive grown up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own\nbeauty.\"\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into\nthe neighbourhood.\"\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would\nbe for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go,\nmerely on that account, for in general you know they visit no new\ncomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for _us_ to visit\nhim, if you do not.\"\n\"You are over scrupulous surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be very\nglad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my\nhearty consent to his marrying which ever he chuses of the girls; though\nI must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.\"\n\"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the\nothers; and I am sure she is not half so handsome as Jane, nor half so\ngood humoured as Lydia. But you are always giving _her_ the\npreference.\"\n\"They have none of them much to recommend them,\" replied he; \"they are\nall silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has something more of\nquickness than her sisters.\"\n\"Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way? You take\ndelight in vexing me. You have no compassion on my poor nerves.\"\n\"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves. They\nare my old friends. I have heard you mention them with consideration\nthese twenty years at least.\"\n\"Ah! you do not know what I suffer.\"\n\"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men of four\nthousand a year come into the neighbourhood.\"\n\"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come since you will not\nvisit them.\"\n\"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will visit them\nall.\"\nMr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,\nreserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had\nbeen insufficient to make his wife understand his character. _Her_ mind\nwas less difficult to develope. She was a woman of mean understanding,\nlittle information, and uncertain temper. When she was discontented she\nfancied herself nervous. The business of her life was to get her\ndaughters married; its solace was visiting and news.",

Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment\nof her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many\nof the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on\nthe business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt\nthat there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such\na quarter, than by supposing a partiality for their niece.

      "text": "Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction\ntook place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see, that her new\nacquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her\nbeing at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;\nbut the observation of a very few minutes convinced her, that she was\nonly exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from\nher beyond a monosyllable.\nMiss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though\nlittle more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance\nwomanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there\nwas sense and good humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly\nunassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as\nacute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much\nrelieved by discerning such different feelings.\nThey had not been long together, before Darcy told her that Bingley was\nalso coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her\nsatisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley's quick step\nwas heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All\nElizabeth's anger against him had been long done away; but, had she\nstill felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the\nunaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself, on seeing her\nagain. He enquired in a friendly, though general way, after her family,\nand looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever\ndone.\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage\nthan to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before\nthem, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just\narisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards\neach with an earnest, though guarded, enquiry; and they soon drew from\nthose enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what\nit was to love. Of the lady's sensations they remained a little in\ndoubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was\nevident enough.\nElizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the\nfeelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to\nmake herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she\nfeared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom she\nendeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour. Bingley\nwas ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.\nIn seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!\nhow ardently did she long to know, whether any of his were directed in a\nlike manner. Sometimes she could fancy, that he talked less than on\nformer occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that\nas he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But, though\nthis might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his behaviour\nto Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival of Jane. No look appeared\non either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between\nthem that could justify the hopes of his sister. On this point she was\nsoon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they\nparted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted a recollection of\nJane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of saying more that\nmight lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He observed to her, at a\nmoment when the others were talking together, and in a tone which had\nsomething of real regret, that it \"was a very long time since he had had\nthe pleasure of seeing her;\" and, before she could reply, he added, \"It\nis above eight months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when\nwe were all dancing together at Netherfield.\"\nElizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards\ntook occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest,\nwhether _all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the\nquestion, nor in the preceding remark, but there was a look and a manner\nwhich gave them meaning.\nIt was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but,\nwhenever she did catch a glimpse, she saw an expression of general\ncomplaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far\nremoved from hauteur or disdain of his companions, as convinced her that\nthe improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed, however\ntemporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one day. When\nshe saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the good opinion\nof people, with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a\ndisgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself, but to the\nvery relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected their last\nlively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the change was so\ngreat, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could hardly\nrestrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the company\nof his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations at\nRosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from\nself-consequence, or unbending reserve as now, when no importance could\nresult from the success of his endeavours, and when even the\nacquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw\ndown the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and\nRosings.\nTheir visitors staid with them above half an hour, and when they arose\nto depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing",

It was evident that she was\nmuch better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;\nit was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to\ninterest, but nothing to justify enquiry.\nOf Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far\nas their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could\nnot be untouched by his politeness, and had they drawn his character\nfrom their own feelings, and his servant's report, without any reference\nto any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known,\nwould not have recognised it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,\nhowever, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible,\nthat the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four\nyears old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be\nhastily rejected. Neither had any thing occurred in the intelligence of\ntheir Lambton friends, that could materially lessen its weight. They\nhad nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if\nnot, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small\nmarket-town, where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged,\nhowever, that he was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.\nWith respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held\nthere in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns, with the\nson of his patron, were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well known\nfact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind\nhim, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.\nAs for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than\nthe last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not\nlong enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and\nshe lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She\ncertainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she\nhad almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,\nthat could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his\nvaluable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some\ntime ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened\ninto somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony so highly in his\nfavour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,\nwhich yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,\nthere was a motive within her of good will which could not be\noverlooked. It was gratitude.--Gratitude, not merely for having once\nloved her, but for loving her still well enough, to forgive all the\npetulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the\nunjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been\npersuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this\naccidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without\nany indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where\ntheir two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good opinion\nof her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such a\nchange in a man of so much pride, excited not only astonishment but\ngratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and as such\nits impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no means\nunpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected, she\nesteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his\nwelfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to\ndepend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both\nthat she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still\npossessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.",

Its windows\nopening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody\nhills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chesnuts\nwhich were scattered over the intermediate lawn.\nIn this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there\nwith Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in\nLondon. Georgiana's reception of them was very civil; but attended with\nall that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the\nfear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves\ninferior, the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and\nher niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.\nBy Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, they were noticed only by a curtsey; and\non their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,\nsucceeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a\ngenteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind\nof discourse, proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the\nothers; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from\nElizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she\nwished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a\nshort sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.\nElizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,\nand that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without\ncalling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her\nfrom trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an\ninconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity\nof saying much. Her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every\nmoment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room. She wished, she\nfeared that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether\nshe wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After\nsitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss\nBingley's voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold\nenquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal\nindifference and brevity, and the other said no more.\nThe next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the\nentrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the\nfinest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a\nsignificant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been\ngiven, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole\nparty; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the\nbeautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected\nthem round the table.",

No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely\nresolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more\nnecessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she\nsaw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,\nand that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour\nwhen he first came into the room.

Miss Darcy, on her brother's\nentrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he\nwas anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,\nas much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss\nBingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the\nfirst opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,\n\"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?\nThey must be a great loss to _your_ family.\"\nIn Darcy's presence she dared not mention Wickham's name; but Elizabeth\ninstantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the\nvarious recollections connected with him gave her a moment's distress;\nbut, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she\npresently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While\nshe spoke, an involuntary glance shewed her Darcy with an heightened\ncomplexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with\nconfusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what\npain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have\nrefrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose\nElizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed\nher partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in\nDarcy's opinion, and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and\nabsurdities, by which some part of her family were connected with that\ncorps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy's meditated\nelopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secresy was\npossible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley's connections her\nbrother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish\nwhich Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming\nhereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan, and without\nmeaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss\nBennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern\nfor the welfare of his friend.\nElizabeth's collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and\nas Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to\nWickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able\nto speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely\nrecollected her interest in the affair, and the very circumstance which\nhad been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have\nfixed them on her more, and more cheerfully.",

But Georgiana would not join\nher. Her brother's recommendation was enough to ensure her favour: his\njudgment could not err, and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as\nto leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than\nlovely and amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley\ncould not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to\nhis sister.\n\"How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,\" she cried; \"I\nnever in my life saw any one so much altered as she is since the winter.\nShe is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we\nshould not have known her again.\"\nHowever little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented\nhimself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than\nher being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the\nsummer.\n\"For my own part,\" she rejoined, \"I must confess that I never could see\nany beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no\nbrilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants\ncharacter; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are\ntolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which\nhave sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive any thing\nextraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not\nlike at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency\nwithout fashion, which is intolerable.\"\nPersuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not\nthe best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always\nwise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the\nsuccess she expected. He was resolutely silent however; and, from a\ndetermination of making him speak, she continued,\n\"I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all\nwere to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect\nyour saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, '_She_\na beauty!--I should as soon call her mother a wit.' But afterwards she\nseemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at\none time.\"\n\"Yes,\" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, \"but _that_\nwas only when I first knew her, for it is many months since I have\nconsidered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.\"\nHe then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of\nhaving forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.",

Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as\nJane had written the direction remarkably ill.\nThey had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her\nuncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by\nthemselves. The one missent must be first attended to; it had been\nwritten five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their\nlittle parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;\nbut the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident\nagitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:\n\"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of\na most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming\nyou--be assured that we are all well.

Thoughtless and indiscreet I\ncan easily believe him, but this step (and let us rejoice over it)\nmarks nothing bad at heart. His choice is disinterested at least,\nfor he must know my father can give her nothing. Our poor mother\nis sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How thankful am I,\nthat we never let them know what has been said against him; we must\nforget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about twelve, as\nis conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at\neight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must\nhave passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason\nto expect him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife,\ninforming her of their intention.

Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would\nwrite, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.\nImprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia\nwould be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place, for\nthere is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to Scotland.\nColonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the day\nbefore, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia's short\nletter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to\nGretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief\nthat W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which\nwas repeated to Colonel F. who instantly taking the alarm, set off\nfrom B. intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to\nClapham, but no farther; for on entering that place they removed\ninto a hackney-coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them\nfrom Epsom. All that is known after this is, that they were seen\nto continue the London road. I know not what to think. After making\nevery possible enquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into\nHertfordshire, anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at\nthe inns in Barnet and Hatfield, but without any success, no such\npeople had been seen to pass through. With the kindest concern he\ncame on to Longbourn, and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner\nmost creditable to his heart. I am sincerely grieved for him and\nMrs. F. but no one can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my\ndear Lizzy, is very great. My father and mother believe the worst,\nbut I cannot think so ill of him. Many circumstances might make it\nmore eligible for them to be married privately in town than to\npursue their first plan; and even if _he_ could form such a design\nagainst a young woman of Lydia's connections, which is not likely,\ncan I suppose her so lost to every thing?--Impossible. I grieve to\nfind, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their\nmarriage; he shook his head when I expressed my hopes, and said he\nfeared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill\nand keeps her room. Could she exert herself it would be better, but\nthis is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in my life\nsaw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed\ntheir attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot\nwonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared\nsomething of these distressing scenes; but now as the first shock\nis over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so\nselfish, however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu. I\ntake up my pen again to do, what I have just told you I would not,\nbut circumstances are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging\nyou all to come here, as soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and\naunt so well, that I am not afraid of requesting it, though I have\nstill something more to ask of the former. My father is going to\nLondon with Colonel Forster instantly, to try to discover her. What\nhe means to do, I am sure I know not; but his excessive distress\nwill not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest\nway, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again\nto-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle's advice and\nassistance would be every thing in the world; he will immediately\ncomprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.\"\n\"Oh! where, where is my uncle?\" cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat\nas she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a\nmoment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was\nopened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and impetuous\nmanner made him start, and before he could recover himself enough to\nspeak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia's\nsituation, hastily exclaimed, \"I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.\nI must find Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be\ndelayed; I have not an instant to lose.\"\n\"Good God! what is the matter?\" cried he, with more feeling than\npoliteness; then recollecting himself, \"I will not detain you a minute,\nbut let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are\nnot well enough;--you cannot go yourself.\"\nElizabeth hesitated, but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how\nlittle would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back\nthe servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an\naccent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and\nmistress home, instantly.\nOn his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and\nlooking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,",

Had I but explained some part of it only--some part of what\nI learnt, to my own family! Had his character been known, this could not\nhave happened. But it is all, all too late now.\"\n\"I am grieved, indeed,\" cried Darcy; \"grieved--shocked.

But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too\nmuch. Wretched, wretched, mistake!\"\nDarcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up\nand down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air\ngloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power\nwas sinking; every thing _must_ sink under such a proof of family\nweakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither\nwonder nor condemn, but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing\nconsolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It\nwas, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own\nwishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved\nhim, as now, when all love must be vain.\nBut self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the\nhumiliation, the misery, she was bringing on them all, soon swallowed up\nevery private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,\nElizabeth was soon lost to every thing else; and, after a pause of\nseveral minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the\nvoice of her companion, who, in a manner, which though it spoke\ncompassion, spoke likewise restraint, said, \"I am afraid you have been\nlong desiring my absence, nor have I any thing to plead in excuse of my\nstay, but real, though unavailing, concern. Would to heaven that any\nthing could be either said or done on my part, that might offer\nconsolation to such distress.--But I will not torment you with vain\nwishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks. This\nunfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister's having the pleasure\nof seeing you at Pemberley to-day.\"\n\"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that\nurgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as\nlong as it is possible.--I know it cannot be long.\"\nHe readily assured her of his secrecy--again expressed his sorrow for\nher distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present\nreason to hope, and leaving his compliments for her relations, with only\none serious, parting, look, went away.",

      "text": "As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they\nshould ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had\nmarked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a\nretrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of\ncontradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those\nfeelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would\nformerly have rejoiced in its termination.\nIf gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth's\nchange of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if\notherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or\nunnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a\nfirst interview with its object, and even before two words have been\nexchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given\nsomewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,\nand that its ill-success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other\nless interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go\nwith regret; and in this early example of what Lydia's infamy must\nproduce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched\nbusiness. Never, since reading Jane's second letter, had she entertained\na hope of Wickham's meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,\ncould flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least\nof her feelings on this developement. While the contents of the first\nletter remained on her mind, she was all surprise--all astonishment that\nWickham should marry a girl, whom it was impossible he could marry for\nmoney; and how Lydia could ever have attached him, had appeared\nincomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment\nas this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not\nsuppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the\nintention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither\nher virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy\nprey.\nShe had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that\nLydia had any partiality for him, but she was convinced that Lydia had\nwanted only encouragement to attach herself to any body. Sometimes one\nofficer, sometimes another had been her favourite, as their attentions\nraised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually\nfluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and\nmistaken indulgence towards such a girl.--Oh! how acutely did she now\nfeel it.\nShe was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot, to\nshare with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a\nfamily so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and\nrequiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing\ncould be done for Lydia, her uncle's interference seemed of the utmost\nimportance, and till he entered the room, the misery of her impatience\nwas severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,\nby the servant's account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill;--but\nsatisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the\ncause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on\nthe postscript of the last, with trembling energy.--Though Lydia had\nnever been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be\ndeeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after\nthe first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily\npromised every assistance in his power.--Elizabeth, though expecting no\nless, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated\nby one spirit, every thing relating to their journey was speedily\nsettled. They were to be off as soon as possible. \"But what is to be\ndone about Pemberley?\" cried Mrs. Gardiner. \"John told us Mr. Darcy was\nhere when you sent for us;--was it so?\"\n\"Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.\n_That_ is all settled.\"\n\"That is all settled;\" repeated the other, as she ran into her room to\nprepare. \"And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real\ntruth! Oh, that I knew how it was!\"\nBut wishes were vain; or at best could serve only to amuse her in the\nhurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure\nto be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was\nimpossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of\nbusiness as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to\nbe written to all their friends in Lambton, with false excuses for their\nsudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.\nGardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn, nothing\nremained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of\nthe morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could\nhave supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.",

It appears to me so very unlikely, that any young man should\nform such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or\nfriendless, and who was actually staying in his colonel's family, that I\nam strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends\nwould not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the\nregiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is\nnot adequate to the risk.\"\n\"Do you really think so?\" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.\n\"Upon my word,\" said Mrs. Gardiner, \"I begin to be of your uncle's\nopinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and\ninterest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of\nWickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him up, as to believe\nhim capable of it?\"\n\"Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect\nI can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not\nhope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the\ncase?\"\n\"In the first place,\" replied Mr. Gardiner, \"there is no absolute proof\nthat they are not gone to Scotland.\"\n\"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into an hackney coach is such a\npresumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the\nBarnet road.\"\n\"Well, then--supposing them to be in London. They may be there, though\nfor the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is\nnot likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it\nmight strike them that they could be more economically, though less\nexpeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.\"\n\"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their\nmarriage be private? Oh! no, no, this is not likely. His most particular\nfriend, you see by Jane's account, was persuaded of his never intending\nto marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He\ncannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she\nbeyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake,\nforego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what\nrestraint the apprehension of disgrace in the corps might throw on a\ndishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know\nnothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your\nother objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no\nbrothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father's\nbehaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever\nseemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would\ndo as little, and think as little about it, as any father could do, in\nsuch a matter.\"",

After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel\nof this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss\nBennet could not assert to be wholly impossible; the former continued\nthe subject, by saying, \"But tell me all and every thing about it, which\nI have not already heard. Give me farther particulars. What did Colonel\nForster say? Had they no apprehension of any thing before the elopement\ntook place? They must have seen them together for ever.\"\n\"Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,\nespecially on Lydia's side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so\ngrieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He\n_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had\nany idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension\nfirst got abroad, it hastened his journey.\"\n\"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of\ntheir intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?\"\n\"Yes; but when questioned by _him_ Denny denied knowing any thing of\ntheir plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not\nrepeat his persuasion of their not marrying--and from _that_, I am\ninclined to hope, he might have been misunderstood before.\"\n\"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a\ndoubt, I suppose, of their being really married?\"\n\"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains! I felt a\nlittle uneasy--a little fearful of my sister's happiness with him in\nmarriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite\nright. My father and mother knew nothing of that, they only felt how\nimprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural\ntriumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia's last\nletter, she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems,\nof their being in love with each other, many weeks.\"\n\"But not before they went to Brighton?\"\n\"No, I believe not.\"\n\"And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he\nknow his real character?\"\n\"I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly\ndid. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant. And since this sad\naffair has taken place, it is said, that he left Meryton greatly in\ndebt; but I hope this may be false.\"\n\"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,\nthis could not have happened!\"\n\"Perhaps it would have been better;\" replied her sister. \"But to expose\nthe former faults of any person, without knowing what their present\nfeelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the best intentions.\"",

What a good joke it will be! I can hardly write for\nlaughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt, for not keeping my\nengagement, and dancing with him to-night. Tell him I hope he will\nexcuse me when he knows all, and tell him I will dance with him at\nthe next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I shall send for my\nclothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you would tell Sally\nto mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown, before they are\npacked up. Good bye. Give my love to Colonel Forster, I hope you\nwill drink to our good journey.\n\"Your affectionate friend,\n\"LYDIA BENNET.\"\n\"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!\" cried Elizabeth when she had\nfinished it. \"What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment.

It had come\nwith a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a\ngentleman and lady's removing from one carriage into another, might be\nremarked, he meant to make enquiries at Clapham. If he could any how\ndiscover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he\ndetermined to make enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible\nto find out the stand and number of the coach.

It was as\nfollows:\n\"MY DEAR SIR,\n\"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation\nin life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now\nsuffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter\nfrom Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear Sir, that Mrs. Collins and\nmyself sincerely sympathise with you, and all your respectable\nfamily, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest\nkind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No\narguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe\na misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that\nmust be of all others most afflicting to a parent's mind. The death\nof your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this.\nAnd it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to\nsuppose, as my dear Charlotte informs me, that this licentiousness\nof behaviour in your daughter, has proceeded from a faulty degree\nof indulgence, though, at the same time, for the consolation of\nyourself and Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her own\ndisposition must be naturally bad, or she could not be guilty of\nsuch an enormity, at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you\nare grievously to be pitied, in which opinion I am not only joined\nby Mrs. Collins, but likewise by lady Catherine and her daughter,\nto whom I have related the affair. They agree with me in\napprehending that this false step in one daughter, will be\ninjurious to the fortunes of all the others, for who, as lady\nCatherine herself condescendingly says, will connect themselves\nwith such a family. And this consideration leads me moreover to\nreflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last\nNovember, for had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in\nall your sorrow and disgrace. Let me advise you then, my dear Sir,\nto console yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy\nchild from your affection for ever, and leave her to reap the\nfruits of her own heinous offence.\n\"I am, dear Sir, &c. &c.\"",

Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would\nbe necessary to clear his expences at Brighton. He owed a good deal in\nthe town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable.

Soon after\nyou left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out in what\npart of London they were. The particulars, I reserve till we meet.\nIt is enough to know they are discovered, I have seen them\nboth----\"\n\"Then it is, as I always hoped,\" cried Jane; \"they are married!\"\nElizabeth read on; \"I have seen them both. They are not married,\nnor can I find there was any intention of being so; but if you are\nwilling to perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on\nyour side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is\nrequired of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement, her\nequal share of the five thousand pounds, secured among your\nchildren after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,\nmoreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her, during your\nlife, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions, which,\nconsidering every thing, I had no hesitation in complying with, as\nfar as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall send this by\nexpress, that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer. You\nwill easily comprehend, from these particulars, that Mr. Wickham's\ncircumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to\nbe. The world has been deceived in that respect; and I am happy to\nsay, there will be some little money, even when all his debts are\ndischarged, to settle on my niece, in addition to her own fortune.\nIf, as I conclude will be the case, you send me full powers to act\nin your name, throughout the whole of this business, I will\nimmediately give directions to Haggerston for preparing a proper\nsettlement. There will not be the smallest occasion for your coming\nto town again; therefore, stay quietly at Longbourn, and depend on\nmy diligence and care. Send back your answer as soon as you can,\nand be careful to write explicitly. We have judged it best, that my\nniece should be married from this house, of which I hope you will\napprove. She comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as any\nthing more is determined on. Your's, &c.\n\"EDW. GARDINER.\"",

Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one\ncommunication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation\nfor good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly\ncontain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner's hope of Lydia's\nbeing soon married, her joy burst forth, and every following sentence\nadded to its exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from\ndelight, as she had ever been fidgetty from alarm and vexation. To know\nthat her daughter would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no\nfear for her felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.\n\"My dear, dear Lydia!\" she cried: \"This is delightful indeed!--She will\nbe married!--I shall see her again!--She will be married at sixteen!--My\ngood, kind brother!--I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage\nevery thing. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the\nclothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about\nthem directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how\nmuch he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,\nKitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear\nLydia!--How merry we shall be together when we meet!\"\nHer eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of\nthese transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.\nGardiner's behaviour laid them all under.\n\"For we must attribute this happy conclusion,\" she added, \"in a great\nmeasure, to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself\nto assist Mr. Wickham with money.\"\n\"Well,\" cried her mother, \"it is all very right; who should do it but\nher own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children\nmust have had all his money you know, and it is the first time we have\never had any thing from him, except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.\nIn a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well\nit sounds. And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in\nsuch a flutter, that I am sure I can't write; so I will dictate, and you\nwrite for me. We will settle with your father about the money\nafterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.\"\nShe was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and\ncambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had\nnot Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait, till her\nfather was at leisure to be consulted. One day's delay she observed,\nwould be of small importance; and her mother was too happy, to be quite\nso obstinate as usual. Other schemes too came into her head.\n\"I will go to Meryton,\" said she, \"as soon as I am dressed, and tell the\ngood, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on\nLady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An\nairing would do me a great deal of good, I am sure. Girls, can I do any\nthing for you in Meryton? Oh! here comes Hill. My dear Hill, have you\nheard the good news? Miss Lydia is going to be married; and you shall\nall have a bowl of punch, to make merry at her wedding.\"\nMrs. Hill began instantly to express her joy. Elizabeth received her\ncongratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took\nrefuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.\nPoor Lydia's situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no\nworse, she had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in\nlooking forward, neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity,\ncould be justly expected for her sister; in looking back to what they\nhad feared, only two hours ago, she felt all the advantages of what they",

He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that\nrespect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle, for whatever of\nhonour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of\nprevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be\nher husband, might then have rested in its proper place.\nHe was seriously concerned, that a cause of so little advantage to any\none, should be forwarded at the sole expence of his brother-in-law, and\nhe was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his\nassistance, and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.\nWhen first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly\nuseless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join\nin cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow\nand younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters\nsuccessively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.\nBennet, for many years after Lydia's birth, had been certain that he\nwould. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too\nlate to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her\nhusband's love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their\nincome.\nFive thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and\nthe children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the\nlatter, depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with\nregard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet\ncould have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In\nterms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though\nexpressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect\napprobation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the\nengagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed\nthat, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be\ndone with so little inconvenience to himself, as by the present\narrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a-year the loser, by the\nhundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket\nallowance, and the continual presents in money, which passed to her,\nthrough her mother's hands, Lydia's expences had been very little within\nthat sum.",

The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of\nher wishes, since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of\naccomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those\nattendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and\nservants.

There were\nfew people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;\nbut at the same time, there was no one, whose knowledge of a sister's\nfrailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of\ndisadvantage from it, individually to herself; for at any rate, there\nseemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia's marriage been\nconcluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that\nMr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other\nobjection would now be added, an alliance and relationship of the\nnearest kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.\nFrom such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The\nwish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his\nfeeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a\nblow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she\nhardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no\nlonger hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there\nseemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that\nshe could have been happy with him; when it was no longer likely they\nshould meet.",

The bride and her mother could neither\nof them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near\nElizabeth, began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,\nwith a good humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her\nreplies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the\nworld. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led\nvoluntarily to subjects, which her sisters would not have alluded to for\nthe world.\n\"Only think of its being three months,\" she cried, \"since I went away;\nit seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been things\nenough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure\nI had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I\nthought it would be very good fun if I was.\"\nHer father lifted up his eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth looked\nexpressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw any thing of\nwhich she chose to be insensible, gaily continued, \"Oh! mamma, do the\npeople here abouts know I am married to-day? I was afraid they might\nnot; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle, so I was\ndetermined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass next to\nhim, and took off my glove, and let my hand just rest upon the window\nframe, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and smiled like\nany thing.\"\nElizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up, and ran out of the room;\nand returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to\nthe dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with\nanxious parade, walk up to her mother's right hand, and hear her say to\nher eldest sister, \"Ah! Jane, I take your place now, and you must go\nlower, because I am a married woman.\"\nIt was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment,\nfrom which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good\nspirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all\ntheir other neighbours, and to hear herself called \"Mrs. Wickham,\" by\neach of them; and in the mean time, she went after dinner to shew her\nring and boast of being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.",

But I must tell you how it went off. We were\nmarried, you know, at St. Clement's, because Wickham's lodgings were in\nthat parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven\no'clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others\nwere to meet us at the church. Well, Monday morning came, and I was in\nsuch a fuss! I was so afraid you know that something would happen to put\nit off, and then I should have gone quite distracted. And there was my\naunt, all the time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if\nshe was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten,\nfor I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to\nknow whether he would be married in his blue coat.\n\"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would never\nbe over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my uncle and aunt\nwere horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you'll believe\nme, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a\nfortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or any thing. To be sure London was\nrather thin, but however the little Theatre was open. Well, and so just\nas the carriage came to the door, my uncle was called away upon business\nto that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get\ntogether, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did not\nknow what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we were beyond\nthe hour, we could not be married all day. But, luckily, he came back\nagain in ten minutes time, and then we all set out. However, I\nrecollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented going, the\nwedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as well.\"",

She was no sooner in possession of it, than\nhurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be\ninterrupted, she sat down on one of the benches, and prepared to be\nhappy; for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not\ncontain a denial.\n\"Gracechurch-street, Sept. 6.\n\"MY DEAR NIECE,\n\"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole\nmorning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will\nnot comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself\nsurprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.\nDon't think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,\nthat I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_\nside. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my\nimpertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am--and nothing\nbut the belief of your being a party concerned, would have allowed\nhim to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and\nignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming\nhome from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.\nDarcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all\nover before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked\nas _your's_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that\nhe had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that\nhe had seen and talked with them both, Wickham repeatedly, Lydia\nonce. From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day\nafter ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting\nfor them. The motive professed, was his conviction of its being\nowing to himself that Wickham's worthlessness had not been so well\nknown, as to make it impossible for any young woman of character,\nto love or confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his\nmistaken pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath\nhim, to lay his private actions open to the world. His character\nwas to speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step\nforward, and endeavour to remedy an evil, which had been brought on\nby himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never\ndisgrace him. He had been some days in town, before he was able to\ndiscover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was\nmore than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this, was another\nreason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a\nMrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was\ndismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though\nhe did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward-street,\nand has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.\nYounge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he\nwent to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But\nit was two or three days before he could get from her what he\nwanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery\nand corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be\nfound. Wickham indeed had gone to her, on their first arrival in\nLondon, and had she been able to receive them into her house, they\nwould have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our\nkind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----\nstreet. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.\nHis first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade\nher to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her\nfriends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,\noffering his assistance, as far as it would go. But he found Lydia\nabsolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none\nof her friends, she wanted no help of his, she would not hear of\nleaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or\nother, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her\nfeelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a\nmarriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he\neasily learnt, had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself\nobliged to leave the regiment, on account of some debts of honour,\nwhich were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the\nill-consequences of Lydia's flight, on her own folly alone. He\nmeant to resign his commission immediately; and as to his future\nsituation, he could conjecture very little about it. He must go\nsomewhere, but he did not know where, and he knew he should have\nnothing to live on. Mr. Darcy asked him why he had not married your\nsister at once. Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich,\nhe would have been able to do something for him, and his situation\nmust have been benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to\nthis question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more\neffectually making his fortune by marriage, in some other country.\nUnder such circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof\nagainst the temptation of immediate relief. They met several times,\nfor there was much to be discussed. Wickham of course wanted more\nthan he could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable.\nEvery thing being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy's next step was\nto make your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in\nGracechurch-street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner\ncould not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further enquiry, that\nyour father was still with him, but would quit town the next\nmorning. He did not judge your father to be a person whom he could\nso properly consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed\nseeing him, till after the departure of the former. He did not\nleave his name, and till the next day, it was only known that a\ngentleman had called on business. On Saturday he came again. Your\nfather was gone, your uncle at home, and, as I said before, they\nhad a great deal of talk together. They met again on Sunday, and\nthen _I_ saw him too. It was not all settled before Monday: as soon\nas it was, the express was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor\nwas very obstinate. I fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real\ndefect of his character after all. He has been accused of many\nfaults at different times; but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was\nto be done that he did not do himself; though I am sure (and I do\nnot speak it to be thanked, therefore say nothing about it,) your\nuncle would most readily have settled the whole. They battled it\ntogether for a long time, which was more than either the gentleman\nor lady concerned in it deserved. But at last your uncle was forced\nto yield, and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece,\nwas forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it,\nwhich went sorely against the grain; and I really believe your\nletter this morning gave him great pleasure, because it required an\nexplanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give\nthe praise where it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no farther\nthan yourself, or Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose,\nwhat has been done for the young people. His debts are to be paid,\namounting, I believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds,\nanother thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his\ncommission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him\nalone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his\nreserve, and want of proper consideration, that Wickham's character\nhad been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been\nreceived and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in\n_this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody's_\nreserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this\nfine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured, that\nyour uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit\nfor _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved\non, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at\nPemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more\nwhen the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to\nreceive the last finish. I believe I have now told you every thing.\nIt is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I\nhope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to\nus; and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was\nexactly what he had been, when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I\nwould not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour\nwhile she staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane's letter\nlast Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a\npiece with it, and therefore what I now tell you, can give you no\nfresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,\nrepresenting to her all the wickedness of what she had done, and\nall the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me,\nit was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was\nsometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth\nand Jane, and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was\npunctual in his return, and as Lydia informed you, attended the\nwedding. He dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again\non Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear\nLizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold\nenough to say before) how much I like him. His behaviour to us has,\nin every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.\nHis understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but\na little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his\nwife may teach him. I thought him very sly;--he hardly ever\nmentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive\nme, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so\nfar, as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I\nhave been all round the park. A low phaeton, with a nice little\npair of ponies, would be the very thing. But I must write no more.\nThe children have been wanting me this half hour. Your's, very\nsincerely,\n\"M. GARDINER.\"",

Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the\nfirst, you may remember.\"\n\"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was not so\npalatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually\ndeclared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business\nhad been compromised accordingly.\"\n\"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation.

      "text": "To Jane, he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused, and\nwhose merit she had undervalued; but to her own more extensive\ninformation, he was the person, to whom the whole family were indebted\nfor the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an\ninterest, if not quite so tender, at least as reasonable and just, as\nwhat Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his\ncoming to Netherfield, to Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her again,\nwas almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered\nbehaviour in Derbyshire.\nThe colour which had been driven from her face, returned for half a\nminute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to\nher eyes, as she thought for that space of time, that his affection and\nwishes must still be unshaken. But she would not be secure.\n\"Let me first see how he behaves,\" said she; \"it will then be early\nenough for expectation.\"\nShe sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without daring to\nlift up her eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her\nsister, as the servant was approaching the door. Jane looked a little\npaler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the\ngentlemen's appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with\ntolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any\nsymptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.\nElizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down\nagain to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She\nhad ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and\nshe thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as\nshe had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps he could not in her mother's\npresence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but\nnot an improbable, conjecture.\nBingley, she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period\nsaw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.\nBennet with a degree of civility, which made her two daughters ashamed,\nespecially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of\nher curtsey and address to his friend.\nElizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the\npreservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was\nhurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill\napplied.\nDarcy, after enquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a question\nwhich she could not answer without confusion, said scarcely any thing.\nHe was not seated by her; perhaps that was the reason of his silence;\nbut it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her\nfriends, when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed,\nwithout bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable\nto resist the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she\nas often found him looking at Jane, as at herself, and frequently on no\nobject but the ground. More thoughtfulness, and less anxiety to please\nthan when they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed,\nand angry with herself for being so.\n\"Could I expect it to be otherwise!\" said she. \"Yet why did he come?\"\nShe was in no humour for conversation with any one but himself; and to\nhim she had hardly courage to speak.\nShe enquired after his sister, but could do no more.\n\"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,\" said Mrs. Bennet.\nHe readily agreed to it.\n\"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,\nyou meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope\nit is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood,\nsince you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled. And one of my\nown daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have\nseen it in the papers. It was in the Times and the Courier, I know;\nthough it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, 'Lately,\nGeorge Wickham, Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,' without there being a\nsyllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or any thing.\nIt was my brother Gardiner's drawing up too, and I wonder how he came to\nmake such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?\"\nBingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth\ndared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could\nnot tell.\n\"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,\"\ncontinued her mother, \"but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very\nhard to have her taken such a way from me. They are gone down to\nNewcastle, a place quite northward, it seems, and there they are to\nstay, I do not know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you\nhave heard of his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the\nregulars. Thank Heaven! he has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so\nmany as he deserves.\"\nElizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery\nof shame, that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her,\nhowever, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually\ndone before; and she asked Bingley, whether he meant to make any stay in\nthe country at present. A few weeks, he believed.\n\"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,\" said her mother,\n\"I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you please, on Mr.\nBennet's manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and\nwill save all the best of the covies for you.\"\nElizabeth's misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious\nattention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had\nflattered them a year ago, every thing, she was persuaded, would be\nhastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,\nthat years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends, for\nmoments of such painful confusion.\n\"The first wish of my heart,\" said she to herself, \"is never more to be\nin company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure,\nthat will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either\none or the other again!\"",

      "text": "They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in\nthe meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes, which the good\nhumour, and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour's visit, had\nrevived.\nOn Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two,\nwho were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as\nsportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the\ndining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take\nthe place, which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by\nher sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to\ninvite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to\nhesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was\ndecided. He placed himself by her.\nElizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He\nbore it with noble indifference, and she would have imagined that\nBingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes\nlikewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing\nalarm.\nHis behaviour to her sister was such, during dinner time, as shewed an\nadmiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded\nElizabeth, that if left wholly to himself, Jane's happiness, and his\nown, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the\nconsequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It\ngave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in\nno cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her, as the table\ncould divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little\nsuch a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to\nadvantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse, but\nshe could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and\ncold was their manner, whenever they did. Her mother's ungraciousness,\nmade the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth's mind;\nand she would, at times, have given any thing to be privileged to tell\nhim, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of\nthe family.\nShe was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of\nbringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away\nwithout enabling them to enter into something more of conversation, than\nthe mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and\nuneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room, before the\ngentlemen came, was wearisome and dull to a degree, that almost made her\nuncivil. She looked forward to their entrance, as the point on which all\nher chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.\n\"If he does not come to me, _then_,\" said she, \"I shall give him up for\never.\"\nThe gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have\nanswered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,\nwhere Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,\nin so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her,\nwhich would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen's approaching, one of\nthe girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,\n\"The men shan't come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;\ndo we?\"\nDarcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with\nher eyes, envied every one to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience\nenough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged against herself\nfor being so silly!\n\"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to\nexpect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex, who would not\nprotest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?\nThere is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings!\"\nShe was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee cup\nhimself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,\n\"Is your sister at Pemberley still?\"\n\"Yes, she will remain there till Christmas.\"\n\"And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?\"\n\"Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough,\nthese three weeks.\"\nShe could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse\nwith her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for\nsome minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady's whispering\nto Elizabeth again, he walked away.\nWhen the tea-things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies\nall rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when\nall her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her\nmother's rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated\nwith the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.\nThey were confined for the evening at different tables, and she had\nnothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side\nof the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.\nMrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to\nsupper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of the\nothers, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.\n\"Well girls,\" said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, \"What\nsay you to the day? I think every thing has passed off uncommonly well,\nI assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The\nvenison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat\na haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the\nLucas's last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges\nwere remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French\ncooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater\nbeauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And\nwhat do you think she said besides? 'Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her\nat Netherfield at last.' She did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long is as good\na creature as ever lived--and her nieces are very pretty behaved girls,\nand not at all handsome: I like them prodigiously.\"\nMrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she had seen enough of\nBingley's behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she would get him at\nlast; and her expectations of advantage to her family, when in a happy\nhumour, were so far beyond reason, that she was quite disappointed at\nnot seeing him there again the next day, to make his proposals.",

Not a word passed\nbetween the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in\nthe happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy\nreturned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably\npersuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's\nconcurrence.\nBingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the\nmorning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more\nagreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption\nor folly in Bingley, that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him\ninto silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric than the\nother had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;\nand in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get\nevery body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter\nto write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea;\nfor as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be\nwanted to counteract her mother's schemes.\nBut on returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished, she\nsaw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother\nhad been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her\nsister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in\nearnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of\nboth as they hastily turned round, and moved away from each other, would\nhave told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _her's_ she\nthought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and\nElizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as\nwell as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few\nwords to her sister, ran out of the room.\nJane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give\npleasure; and instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest\nemotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.\n\"'Tis too much!\" she added, \"by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh!\nwhy is not every body as happy?\"\nElizabeth's congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a\ndelight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of\nkindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not\nallow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be\nsaid, for the present.\n\"I must go instantly to my mother;\" she cried. \"I would not on any\naccount trifle with her affectionate solicitude; or allow her to hear it\nfrom any one but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh! Lizzy, to\nknow that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear\nfamily! how shall I bear so much happiness!\"",

She will be down in a moment I dare say.\"\nHe then shut the door, and coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and\naffection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her\ndelight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with\ngreat cordiality; and then till her sister came down, she had to listen\nto all he had to say, of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections;\nand in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his\nexpectations of felicity, to be rationally founded, because they had for\nbasis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of\nJane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and\nhimself.\nIt was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of\nMiss Bennet's mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face, as\nmade her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped\nher turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or\nspeak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,\nthough she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when\nMr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly shewed\nhow really happy he was.\nNot a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their\nvisitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he\nturned to his daughter and said,\n\"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.\"\nJane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his\ngoodness.\n\"You are a good girl;\" he replied, \"and I have great pleasure in\nthinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your\ndoing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are\neach of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so\neasy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will\nalways exceed your income.\"\n\"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters, would be\nunpardonable in _me_.\"\n\"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,\" cried his wife, \"what are you\ntalking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a-year, and very likely\nmore.\" Then addressing her daughter, \"Oh! my dear, dear Jane, I am so\nhappy! I am sure I sha'nt get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it\nwould be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not\nbe so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when\nhe first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was\nthat you should come together. Oh! he is the handsomest young man that\never was seen!\"\nWickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her\nfavourite child. At that moment, she cared for no other. Her younger\nsisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness\nwhich she might in future be able to dispense.\nMary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty\nbegged very hard for a few balls there every winter.\nBingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;\ncoming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after\nsupper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough\ndetested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought\nhimself obliged to accept.",

My youngest of all, is lately married,\nand my eldest is somewhere about the grounds, walking with a young man,\nwho I believe will soon become a part of the family.\"\n\"You have a very small park here,\" returned Lady Catherine after a short\nsilence.\n\"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but I\nassure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas's.\"\n\"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening, in\nsummer; the windows are full west.\"\nMrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then\nadded,\n\"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left Mr. and\nMrs. Collins well.\"\n\"Yes, very well.

I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you\nwill favour me with your company.\"\n\"Go, my dear,\" cried her mother, \"and shew her ladyship about the\ndifferent walks.

As they passed through the hall,\nLady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and\ndrawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be decent\nlooking rooms, walked on.\nHer carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her\nwaiting-woman was in it.

If there is no\nother objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be\nkept from it, by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry\nMiss De Bourgh. You both did as much as you could, in planning the\nmarriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by\nhonour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make\nanother choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?\"",

Lady Catherine it\nappeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings,\nfor the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.\nDarcy. It was a rational scheme to be sure! but from what the report of\ntheir engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;\ntill she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,\nand _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the\nexpectation of one wedding, made every body eager for another, to supply\nthe idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her\nsister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at\nLucas lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the\nCollinses, the report she concluded had reached lady Catherine) had only\nset _that_ down, as almost certain and immediate, which _she_ had looked\nforward to as possible, at some future time.\nIn revolving lady Catherine's expressions, however, she could not help\nfeeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting\nin this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to\nprevent their marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate\nan application to her nephew; and how _he_ might take a similar\nrepresentation of the evils attached to a connection with her, she dared\nnot pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his\naunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose\nthat he thought much higher of her ladyship than _she_ could do; and it\nwas certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_,\nwhose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would\naddress him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would\nprobably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak\nand ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.\nIf he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often\nseemed likely, the advice and intreaty of so near a relation might\nsettle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy, as dignity\nunblemished could make him.

He begins with\ncongratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of\nwhich it seems he has been told, by some of the good-natured, gossiping\nLucases. I shall not sport with your impatience, by reading what he says\non that point. What relates to yourself, is as follows. \"Having thus\noffered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on\nthis happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another:\nof which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter\nElizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after\nher elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of her fate,\nmay be reasonably looked up to, as one of the most illustrious\npersonages in this land.\"\n\"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?\" \"This young\ngentleman is blessed in a peculiar way, with every thing the heart of\nmortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and extensive\npatronage. Yet in spite of all these temptations, let me warn my cousin\nElizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur, by a precipitate\nclosure with this gentleman's proposals, which, of course, you will be\ninclined to take immediate advantage of.\"\n\"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out.\"\n\"My motive for cautioning you, is as follows. We have reason to imagine\nthat his aunt, lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with\na friendly eye.\"\n\"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_\nsurprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within\nthe circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more\neffectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any\nwoman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in\nhis life! It is admirable!\"\nElizabeth tried to join in her father's pleasantry, but could only force\none most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so\nlittle agreeable to her.\n\"Are you not diverted?\"\n\"Oh! yes. Pray read on.\"\n\"After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last\nnight, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she\nfelt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that on the score of some\nfamily objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give her\nconsent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty\nto give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she and\nher noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run\nhastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.\" \"Mr.\nCollins moreover adds,\" \"I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia's sad\nbusiness has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their\nliving together before the marriage took place, should be so generally\nknown. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain\nfrom declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young\ncouple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an\nencouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should\nvery strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as\na christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their names\nto be mentioned in your hearing.\" \"_That_ is his notion of christian\nforgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear Charlotte's\nsituation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you\nlook as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be _Missish_, I\nhope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For what do we\nlive, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our\nturn?\"\n\"Oh!\" cried Elizabeth, \"I am excessively diverted. But it is so\nstrange!\"\n\"Yes--_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man\nit would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference, and _your_\npointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate\nwriting, I would not give up Mr. Collins's correspondence for any\nconsideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving\nhim the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and\nhypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine\nabout this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?\"\nTo this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had\nbeen asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his\nrepeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her\nfeelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh, when she\nwould rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her, by\nwhat he said of Mr. Darcy's indifference, and she could do nothing but\nwonder at such a want of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of",

The recollection of what I\nthen said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of\nit, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your\nreproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: 'had you behaved in a\nmore gentleman-like manner.' Those were your words. You know not, you\ncan scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me;--though it was some\ntime, I confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.\"\n\"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an\nimpression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such\na way.\"\n\"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper\nfeeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never\nforget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible\nway, that would induce you to accept me.\"\n\"Oh! do not repeat what I then said.

Did you, on reading it, give any credit to its\ncontents?\"\nShe explained what its effect on her had been, and how gradually all her\nformer prejudices had been removed.\n\"I knew,\" said he, \"that what I wrote must give you pain, but it was\nnecessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was one part\nespecially, the opening of it, which I should dread your having the\npower of reading again. I can remember some expressions which might\njustly make you hate me.\"\n\"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential to the\npreservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason to think my\nopinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I hope, quite so easily\nchanged as that implies.\"\n\"When I wrote that letter,\" replied Darcy, \"I believed myself perfectly\ncalm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was written in a\ndreadful bitterness of spirit.\"\n\"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The\nadieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings\nof the person who wrote, and the person who received it, are now so\nwidely different from what they were then, that every unpleasant\ncircumstance attending it, ought to be forgotten. You must learn some\nof my philosophy. Think only of the past as its remembrance gives you\npleasure.\"\n\"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_\nretrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment\narising from them, is not of philosophy, but what is much better, of\nignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will\nintrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a\nselfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a\nchild I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my\ntemper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride\nand conceit. Unfortunately an only son, (for many years an only _child_)\nI was spoilt by my parents, who though good themselves, (my father\nparticularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,\nalmost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond\nmy own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to\n_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with\nmy own. Such I was, from eight to eight and twenty; and such I might\nstill have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not\nowe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most\nadvantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a\ndoubt of my reception. You shewed me how insufficient were all my\npretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.\"\n\"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?\"\n\"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be\nwishing, expecting my addresses.\"\n\"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally I assure you.\nI never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me wrong.\nHow you must have hated me after _that_ evening?\"\n\"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began to take\na proper direction.\"\n\"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me; when we met at\nPemberley. You blamed me for coming?\"\n\"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise.\"\n\"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.\nMy conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I\nconfess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.\"\n\"My object _then_,\" replied Darcy, \"was to shew you, by every civility\nin my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped\nto obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you\nsee that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes\nintroduced themselves I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half an\nhour after I had seen you.\"\nHe then told her of Georgiana's delight in her acquaintance, and of her\ndisappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to\nthe cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of\nfollowing her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister, had been formed\nbefore he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness\nthere, had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must\ncomprehend.\nShe expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to\neach, to be dwelt on farther.\nAfter walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know",

I guessed as much.\" And\nthough he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much\nthe case.\n\"On the evening before my going to London,\" said he \"I made a confession\nto him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told him of\nall that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs,\nabsurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had the\nslightest suspicion.

I had narrowly observed her during the two visits\nwhich I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.\"\n\"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to\nhim.\"\n\"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had\nprevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but\nhis reliance on mine, made every thing easy. I was obliged to confess\none thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not\nallow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months\nlast winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was\nangry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained\nin any doubt of your sister's sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me\nnow.\"\nElizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful\nfriend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked\nherself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laught at, and it\nwas rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley,\nwhich of course was to be inferior only to his own, he continued the\nconversation till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.",

      "text": "The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The\nacknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent.\nDarcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;\nand Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy,\nthan _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,\nthere were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in\nthe family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one\nliked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a\n_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.\nAt night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far\nfrom Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.\n\"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!--engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,\nyou shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible.\"\n\"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and\nI am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I am\nin earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we are\nengaged.\"\nJane looked at her doubtingly. \"Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much\nyou dislike him.\"\n\"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I\ndid not always love him so well as I do now. But in such cases as these,\na good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever\nremember it myself.\"\nMiss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more\nseriously assured her of its truth.\n\"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,\" cried\nJane. \"My dear, dear Lizzy, I would--I do congratulate you--but are you\ncertain? forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be\nhappy with him?\"\n\"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already, that\nwe are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased,\nJane? Shall you like to have such a brother?\"\n\"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more\ndelight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you\nreally love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do any thing rather than\nmarry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought\nto do?\"\n\"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do, when I\ntell you all.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"Why, I must confess, that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am\nafraid you will be angry.\"\n\"My dearest sister, now _be_ be serious. I want to talk very seriously.\nLet me know every thing that I am to know, without delay. Will you tell\nme how long you have loved him?\"\n\"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began.\nBut I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds\nat Pemberley.\"\nAnother intreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the\ndesired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of\nattachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing\nfarther to wish.\n\"Now I am quite happy,\" said she, \"for you will be as happy as myself. I\nalways had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I\nmust always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley's friend and your\nhusband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But\nLizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you\ntell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know\nof it, to another, not to you.\"\nElizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to\nmention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made\nher equally avoid the name of his friend. But now she would no longer\nconceal from her, his share in Lydia's marriage. All was acknowledged,\nand half the night spent in conversation.",

Wont it, Kitty?\"\nKitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great\ncuriosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently\nconsented. As she went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,\nsaying,\n\"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that\ndisagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind it: it is\nall for Jane's sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to\nhim, except just now and then. So, do not put yourself to\ninconvenience.\"\nDuring their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet's consent should be\nasked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved to herself the\napplication for her mother's. She could not determine how her mother\nwould take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur\nwould be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man. But whether she\nwere violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it\nwas certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to\nher sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the\nfirst raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her\ndisapprobation.\n* * * * *",

She did not fear her father's opposition, but he was going to\nbe made unhappy, and that it should be through her means, that _she_,\nhis favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be\nfilling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched\nreflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,\nlooking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes\nhe approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while\npretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, \"Go to your father, he\nwants you in the library.\" She was gone directly.\nHer father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.\n\"Lizzy,\" said he, \"what are you doing? Are you out of your senses, to be\naccepting this man? Have not you always hated him?\"\nHow earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more\nreasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from\nexplanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;\nbut they were now necessary, and she assured him with some confusion, of\nher attachment to Mr. Darcy.\n\"Or in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be\nsure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.\nBut will they make you happy?\"\n\"Have you any other objection,\" said Elizabeth, \"than your belief of my\nindifference?\"\n\"None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but\nthis would be nothing if you really liked him.\"\n\"I do, I do like him,\" she replied, with tears in her eyes, \"I love him.\nIndeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not\nknow what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in\nsuch terms.\"\n\"Lizzy,\" said her father, \"I have given him my consent. He is the kind\nof man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse any thing, which he\ncondescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on\nhaving him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your\ndisposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor\nrespectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband; unless you looked\nup to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the\ngreatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape\ndiscredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing\n_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are\nabout.\"\nElizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;\nand at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the\nobject of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her\nestimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that\nhis affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many\nmonths suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities, she\ndid conquer her father's incredulity, and reconcile him to the match.\n\"Well, my dear,\" said he, when she ceased speaking, \"I have no more to\nsay. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with\nyou, my Lizzy, to any one less worthy.\"\nTo complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy\nhad voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.\n\"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every thing;\nmade up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow's debts, and got him\nhis commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble\nand economy. Had it been your uncle's doing, I must and _would_ have\npaid him; but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own\nway. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow; he will rant and storm about\nhis love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.\"\nHe then recollected her embarrassment a few days before, on his reading\nMr. Collins's letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her\nat last to go--saying, as she quitted the room, \"If any young men come\nfor Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.\"",

Its effect was most\nextraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and\nunable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that\nshe could comprehend what she heard; though not in general backward to\ncredit what was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the\nshape of a lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to\nfidget about in her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless\nherself.\n\"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would\nhave thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich\nand how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages\nyou will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so\npleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my\ndear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I\nhope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing\nthat is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,\nLord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.\"\nThis was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted: and\nElizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,\nsoon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,\nher mother followed her.\n\"My dearest child,\" she cried, \"I can think of nothing else! Ten\nthousand a year, and very likely more! 'Tis as good as a Lord! And a\nspecial licence. You must and shall be married by a special licence. But\nmy dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond of,\nthat I may have it to-morrow.\"\nThis was a sad omen of what her mother's behaviour to the gentleman\nhimself might be; and Elizabeth found, that though in the certain\npossession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations'\nconsent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow\npassed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood\nin such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak\nto him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark\nher deference for his opinion.\nElizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get\nacquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising\nevery hour in his esteem.\n\"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,\" said he. \"Wickham, perhaps,\nis my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband quite as well\nas Jane's.\"",

Elizabeth will\nsoon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as\nyou can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has\nmore to give.\n\"Your's sincerely, &c.\"\nMiss Bingley's congratulations to her brother, on his approaching\nmarriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even\nto Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her\nformer professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was\naffected; and though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing\nher a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved.\nThe joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information, was\nas sincere as her brother's in sending it. Four sides of paper were\ninsufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of\nbeing loved by her sister.\nBefore any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations\nto Elizabeth, from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the\nCollinses were come themselves to Lucas lodge. The reason of this sudden\nremoval was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so\nexceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew's letter, that\nCharlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till\nthe storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend\nwas a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their\nmeetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she\nsaw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her\nhusband. He bore it however with admirable calmness. He could even\nlisten to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away\nthe brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all\nmeeting frequently at St. James's, with very decent composure. If he did\nshrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.\nMrs. Philips's vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater tax on his\nforbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in\ntoo much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley's good\nhumour encouraged, yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be vulgar.\nNor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at all\nlikely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could, to shield\nhim from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him\nto herself, and to those of her family with whom he might converse\nwithout mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings arising\nfrom all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure, it\nadded to the hope of the future; and she looked forward with delight to\nthe time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to",

The congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received\nfrom Lydia on her marriage, explained to her that, by his wife at least,\nif not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this\neffect:\n\"MY DEAR LIZZY,\n\"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my dear\nWickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you\nso rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will\nthink of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very\nmuch, and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live\nupon without some help. Any place would do, of about three or four\nhundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,\nif you had rather not.\n\"Yours, &c.\"\nAs it happened that Elizabeth had _much_ rather not, she endeavoured in\nher answer to put an end to every intreaty and expectation of the kind.\nSuch relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice\nof what might be called economy in her own private expences, she\nfrequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an\nincome as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in\ntheir wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to\ntheir support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or\nherself were sure of being applied to, for some little assistance\ntowards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the\nrestoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the\nextreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap\nsituation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection for\nher soon sunk into indifference; her's lasted a little longer; and in\nspite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to\nreputation which her marriage had given her.",

      "text": "Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\nsuccessful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\nto watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\ndoor and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\nentered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\nwarm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\nreceived and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\nproceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\nof which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\nrefusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\nfrom her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\nThis information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet;--she would have been\nglad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\nhim by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not to believe\nit, and could not help saying so.\n\"But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,\" she added, \"that Lizzy shall be\nbrought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\na very headstrong foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\nI will _make_ her know it.\"\n\"Pardon me for interrupting you, Madam,\" cried Mr. Collins; \"but if she\nis really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\naltogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\nnaturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If therefore she\nactually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\nforce her into accepting me, because if liable to such defects of\ntemper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.\"\n\"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,\" said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. \"Lizzy is\nonly headstrong in such matters as these. In every thing else she is as\ngood natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\nwe shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.\"\nShe would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\nhusband, called out as she entered the library,\n\"Oh! Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\nYou must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\nnot have him, and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\nnot have _her_.\"\nMr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\non her face with a calm unconcern which was not in the least altered by\nher communication.\n\"I have not the pleasure of understanding you,\" said he, when she had\nfinished her speech. \"Of what are you talking?\"\n\"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\nand Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.\"\n\"And what am I to do on the occasion?--It seems an hopeless business.\"\n\"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\nmarrying him.\"\n\"Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.\"\nMrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\nlibrary.\n\"Come here, child,\" cried her father as she appeared. \"I have sent for\nyou on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\nyou an offer of marriage. Is it true?\" Elizabeth replied that it was.\n\"Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?\"\n\"I have, Sir.\"\n\"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\naccepting it. Is not it so, Mrs. Bennet?\"\n\"Yes, or I will never see her again.\"\n\"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\nbe a stranger to one of your parents.--Your mother will never see you\nagain if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\nif you _do_.\"\nElizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\nbut Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\naffair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.",

The envelope contained a\nsheet of elegant, little, hot pressed paper, well covered with a lady's\nfair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister's countenance change as\nshe read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\nJane recollected herself soon, and putting the letter away, tried to\njoin with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation; but\nElizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\neven from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\nthan a glance from Jane invited her to follow her up stairs. When they\nhad gained their own room, Jane taking out the letter, said,\n\"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains, has surprised me a\ngood deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are\non their way to town; and without any intention of coming back again.\nYou shall hear what she says.\"\nShe then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\nof their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\nand of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor street, where Mr.\nHurst had a house. The next was in these words. \"I do not pretend to\nregret any thing I shall leave in Hertfordshire, except your society, my\ndearest friend; but we will hope at some future period, to enjoy many\nreturns of the delightful intercourse we have known, and in the mean\nwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\nunreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.\" To these high\nflown expressions, Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\ndistrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\nsaw nothing in it really to lament; it was not to be supposed that their\nabsence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley's being there; and as\nto the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\ncease to regard it, in the enjoyment of his.\n\"It is unlucky,\" said she, after a short pause, \"that you should not be\nable to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\nhope that the period of future happiness to which Miss Bingley looks\nforward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful",

      "text": "intercourse you have known as friends, will be renewed with yet greater\nsatisfaction as sisters?--Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\nthem.\"\n\"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\nHertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you--\n\"When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\ntook him to London, might be concluded in three or four days, but as we\nare certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\nCharles gets to town, he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\ndetermined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\nhis vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\nalready there for the winter; I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\nfriend, had any intention of making one in the croud, but of that I\ndespair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\nthe gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\nwill be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three, of\nwhom we shall deprive you.\"\n\"It is evident by this,\" added Jane, \"that he comes back no more this\nwinter.\"\n\"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.\"\n\"Why will you think so? It must be his own doing.--He is his own master.\nBut you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\nparticularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.\" \"Mr. Darcy\nis impatient to see his sister, and to confess the truth, _we_ are\nscarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana\nDarcy has her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the\naffection she inspires in Louisa and myself, is heightened into\nsomething still more interesting, from the hope we dare to entertain of\nher being hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before\nmentioned to you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the\ncountry without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\nunreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already, he will have\nfrequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing, her\nrelations all wish the connection as much as his own, and a sister's\npartiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\ncapable of engaging any woman's heart. With all these circumstances to\nfavour an attachment and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\nJane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\nof so many?\"\n\"What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?\"--said Jane as she\nfinished it. \"Is it not clear enough?--Does it not expressly declare\nthat Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister; that she\nis perfectly convinced of her brother's indifference, and that if she\nsuspects the nature of my feelings for him, she means (most kindly!) to\nput me on my guard? Can there be any other opinion on the subject?\"\n\"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different.--Will you hear it?\"\n\"Most willingly.\"\n\"You shall have it in few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\nin love with you, and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\ntown in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\ndoes not care about you.\"\nJane shook her head.\n\"Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me.--No one who has ever seen you\ntogether, can doubt his affection. Miss Bingley I am sure cannot. She is\nnot such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr. Darcy\nfor herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the case is\nthis. We are not rich enough, or grand enough for them; and she is the\nmore anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion that\nwhen there has been _one_ intermarriage, she may have less trouble in\nachieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\ndare say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,\nmy dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss Bingley\ntells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\ndegree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\nTuesday, or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of\nbeing in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.\"\n\"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,\" replied Jane, \"your\nrepresentation of all this, might make me quite easy. But I know the\nfoundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving any\none; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\nherself.\"\n\"That is right.--You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\nwill not take comfort in mine. Believe her to be deceived by all means.\nYou have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.\"\n\"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\naccepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\nelsewhere?\"\n\"You must decide for yourself,\" said Elizabeth, \"and if upon mature\ndeliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\nmore than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you by\nall means to refuse him.\"\n\"How can you talk so?\"--said Jane faintly smiling,--\"You must know that\nthough I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\nnot hesitate.\"\n\"I did not think you would;--and that being the case, I cannot consider\nyour situation with much compassion.\"\n\"But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\nrequired. A thousand things may arise in six months!\"\nThe idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\ncontempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline's\ninterested wishes, and she could not for a moment suppose that those\nwishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\nso totally independent of every one.\nShe represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on\nthe subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\nJane's temper was not desponding, and she was gradually led to hope,\nthough the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\nBingley would return to Netherfield and answer every wish of her heart.\nThey agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\nfamily, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman's conduct;\nbut even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\nand she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\nto go away, just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\nlamenting it however at some length, she had the consolation of thinking\nthat Mr. Bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at Longbourn,\nand the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that, though\nhe had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take care to have\ntwo full courses.",

Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a\nprivate conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.\nThe possibility of Mr. Collins's fancying himself in love with her\nfriend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two; but\nthat Charlotte could encourage him, seemed almost as far from\npossibility as that she could encourage him herself, and her\nastonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the\nbounds of decorum, and she could not help crying out,\n\"Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte,--impossible!\"\nThe steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her\nstory, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a\nreproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon\nregained her composure, and calmly replied,\n\"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza?--Do you think it incredible\nthat Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman's good opinion,\nbecause he was not so happy as to succeed with you?\"\nBut Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong effort\nfor it, was able to assure her with tolerable firmness that the prospect\nof their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she wished\nher all imaginable happiness.\n\"I see what you are feeling,\" replied Charlotte,--\"you must be\nsurprised, very much surprised,--so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to\nmarry you. But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you\nwill be satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic you know. I\nnever was. I ask only a comfortable home; and considering Mr. Collins's\ncharacter, connections, and situation in life, I am convinced that my\nchance of happiness with him is as fair, as most people can boast on\nentering the marriage state.\"\nElizabeth quietly answered \"Undoubtedly;\"--and after an awkward pause,\nthey returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not stay much\nlonger, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard. It\nwas a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so\nunsuitable a match. The strangeness of Mr. Collins's making two offers\nof marriage within three days, was nothing in comparison of his being\nnow accepted. She had always felt that Charlotte's opinion of matrimony\nwas not exactly like her own, but she could not have supposed it\npossible that when called into action, she would have sacrificed every\nbetter feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins,\nwas a most humiliating picture!--And to the pang of a friend disgracing\nherself and sunk in her esteem, was added the distressing conviction\nthat it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot",

With many compliments to them,\nand much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the\nhouses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,\nbut incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than\npoliteness, protested he must be entirely mistaken, and Lydia, always\nunguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,\n\"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story?--Do not you know\nthat Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?\"\nNothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne\nwithout anger such treatment; but Sir William's good breeding carried\nhim through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the\ntruth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the\nmost forbearing courtesy.\nElizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant\na situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by\nmentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and\nendeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,\nby the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she\nwas readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the\nhappiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character\nof Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.\nMrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while\nSir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings\nfound a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving\nthe whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins\nhad been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy\ntogether; and fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two\ninferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole; one, that\nElizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that\nshe herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two\npoints she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could\nconsole and nothing appease her.--Nor did that day wear out her\nresentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without\nscolding her, a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William\nor Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months were gone before she\ncould at all forgive their daughter.",

The promised\nletter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their\nfather, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a\ntwelvemonth's abode in the family might have prompted. After discharging\nhis conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them, with many\nrapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the affection\nof their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it was\nmerely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready\nto close with their kind wish of seeing him again at Longbourn, whither\nhe hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight; for Lady Catherine,\nhe added, so heartily approved his marriage, that she wished it to take\nplace as soon as possible, which he trusted would be an unanswerable\nargument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him\nthe happiest of men.\nMr. Collins's return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of\npleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary she was as much disposed to\ncomplain of it as her husband.--It was very strange that he should come\nto Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient\nand exceedingly troublesome.--She hated having visitors in the house\nwhile her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the\nmost disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they\ngave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley's continued\nabsence.\nNeither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject.

Unwilling as she\nwas to admit an idea so destructive of Jane's happiness, and so\ndishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its\nfrequently recurring.

The very mention of any\nthing concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill humour, and\nwherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of\nMiss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she\nregarded her with jealous abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see\nthem she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and\nwhenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that\nthey were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself\nand her daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were dead. She\ncomplained bitterly of all this to her husband.",
