But thou art not quickly moved to strike.\nSamp. A dog of the house of Montague moves me.\nGreg. To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.\nTherefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.\nSamp. A dog of that house shall move me to stand. I will take\nthe\nwall of any man or maid of Montague's.\nGreg. That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes to the\nwall.\nSamp. 'Tis true; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,\nare\never thrust to the wall. Therefore I will push Montague's men\nfrom the wall and thrust his maids to the wall.\nGreg. The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.\nSamp. 'Tis all one. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have\nfought\nwith the men, I will be cruel with the maids- I will cut off\ntheir heads.\nGreg. The heads of the maids?\nSamp. Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads.\nTake it in what sense thou wilt.\nGreg. They must take it in sense that feel it.\nSamp. Me they shall feel while I am able to stand; and 'tis\nknown I\nam a pretty piece of flesh.\nGreg. 'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst\nbeen\npoor-John. Draw thy tool! Here comes two of the house of\nMontagues.\nEnter two other Servingmen [Abram and Balthasar].\nSamp. My naked weapon is out. Quarrel! I will back thee.\nGreg. How? turn thy back and run?\nSamp. Fear me not.\nGreg. No, marry. I fear thee!\nSamp. Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.\nGreg. I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they\nlist.\nSamp. Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them; which is\ndisgrace to them, if they bear it.\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\nSamp. I do bite my thumb, sir.\nAbr. Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?\nSamp. [aside to Gregory] Is the law of our side if I say ay?\nGreg. [aside to Sampson] No.\nSamp. No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite\nmy\nthumb, sir.\nGreg. Do you quarrel, sir?\nAbr. Quarrel, sir? No, sir.\nSamp. But if you do, sir, am for you. I serve as good a man as\nyou.\nAbr. No better.\nSamp. Well, sir.\nEnter Benvolio.\nGreg. [aside to Sampson] Say 'better.' Here comes one of my\nmaster's kinsmen.\nSamp. Yes, better, sir.\nAbr. You lie.\nSamp. Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.\nThey fight.\nBen. Part, fools! [Beats down their swords.]\nPut up your swords. You know not what you do.\nEnter Tybalt.\nTyb. What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?\nTurn thee Benvolio! look upon thy death.\nBen. I do but keep the peace. Put up thy sword,\nOr manage it to part these men with me.\nTyb. What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word\nAs I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee.\nHave at thee, coward! They fight.\nEnter an officer, and three or four Citizens with clubs or\npartisans.\nOfficer. Clubs, bills, and partisans! Strike! beat them down!\nCitizens. Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!\nEnter Old Capulet in his gown, and his Wife.\nCap. What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!\nWife. A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?\nCap. My sword, I say! Old Montague is come\nAnd flourishes his blade in spite of me.\nEnter Old Montague and his Wife.\nMon. Thou villain Capulet!- Hold me not, let me go.\nM. Wife. Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.\nEnter Prince Escalus, with his Train.\nPrince. Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,\nProfaners of this neighbour-stained steel-\nWill they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,\nThat quench the fire of your pernicious rage\nWith purple fountains issuing from your veins!\nOn pain of torture, from those bloody hands\nThrow your mistempered weapons to the ground\nAnd hear the sentence of your moved prince.\nThree civil brawls, bred of an airy word\nBy thee, old Capulet, and Montague,\nHave thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets\nAnd made Verona's ancient citizens\nCast by their grave beseeming ornaments\nTo wield old partisans, in hands as old,\nCank'red with peace, to part your cank'red hate.\nIf ever you disturb our streets again,\nYour lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.\nFor this time all the rest depart away.\nYou, Capulet, shall go along with me;\nAnd, Montague, come you this afternoon,\nTo know our farther pleasure in this case,\nTo old Freetown, our common judgment place.\nOnce more, on pain of death, all men depart.\nExeunt [all but Montague, his Wife, and Benvolio].",

'Tis he, that villain Romeo.\nCap. Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone.\n'A bears him like a portly gentleman,\nAnd, to say truth, Verona brags of him\nTo be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth.\nI would not for the wealth of all this town\nHere in my house do him disparagement.\nTherefore be patient, take no note of him.\nIt is my will; the which if thou respect,\nShow a fair presence and put off these frowns,\nAn ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.\nTyb.

Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting\nMakes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.\nI will withdraw; but this intrusion shall,\nNow seeming sweet, convert to bitt'rest gall. Exit.\nRom. If I profane with my unworthiest hand\nThis holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:\nMy lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand\nTo smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.\nJul. Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,\nWhich mannerly devotion shows in this;\nFor saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,\nAnd palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.\nRom. Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?\nJul. Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in pray'r.\nRom. O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do!\nThey pray; grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.\nJul. Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.\nRom. Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.\nThus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd. [Kisses her.]\nJul. Then have my lips the sin that they have took.\nRom. Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg'd!\nGive me my sin again. [Kisses her.]\nJul. You kiss by th' book.\nNurse. Madam, your mother craves a word with you.\nRom. What is her mother?\nNurse. Marry, bachelor,\nHer mother is the lady of the house.\nAnd a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.\nI nurs'd her daughter that you talk'd withal.\nI tell you, he that can lay hold of her\nShall have the chinks.\nRom.

I know not.\nJul. Go ask his name.- If he be married,\nMy grave is like to be my wedding bed.\nNurse. His name is Romeo, and a Montague,\nThe only son of your great enemy.\nJul. My only love, sprung from my only hate!\nToo early seen unknown, and known too late!\nProdigious birth of love it is to me\nThat I must love a loathed enemy.\nNurse. What's this? what's this?\nJul.

What light through yonder window breaks?\nIt is the East, and Juliet is the sun!\nArise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,\nWho is already sick and pale with grief\nThat thou her maid art far more fair than she.\nBe not her maid, since she is envious.\nHer vestal livery is but sick and green,\nAnd none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.\nIt is my lady; O, it is my love!\nO that she knew she were!\nShe speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?\nHer eye discourses; I will answer it.\nI am too bold; 'tis not to me she speaks.\nTwo of the fairest stars in all the heaven,\nHaving some business, do entreat her eyes\nTo twinkle in their spheres till they return.\nWhat if her eyes were there, they in her head?\nThe brightness of her cheek would shame those stars\nAs daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven\nWould through the airy region stream so bright\nThat birds would sing and think it were not night.\nSee how she leans her cheek upon her hand!\nO that I were a glove upon that hand,\nThat I might touch that cheek!\nJul. Ah me!\nRom. She speaks.\nO, speak again, bright angel! for thou art\nAs glorious to this night, being o'er my head,\nAs is a winged messenger of heaven\nUnto the white-upturned wond'ring eyes\nOf mortals that fall back to gaze on him\nWhen he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds\nAnd sails upon the bosom of the air.\nJul. O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\nDeny thy father and refuse thy name!\nOr, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,\nAnd I'll no longer be a Capulet.\nRom. [aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?\nJul. 'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.\nThou art thyself, though not a Montague.\nWhat's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,\nNor arm, nor face, nor any other part\nBelonging to a man. O, be some other name!\nWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose\nBy any other name would smell as sweet.\nSo Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,\nRetain that dear perfection which he owes\nWithout that title. Romeo, doff thy name;\nAnd for that name, which is no part of thee,\nTake all myself.\nRom. I take thee at thy word.\nCall me but love, and I'll be new baptiz'd;\nHenceforth I never will be Romeo.\nJul. What man art thou that, thus bescreen'd in night,\nSo stumblest on my counsel?\nRom. By a name\nI know not how to tell thee who I am.\nMy name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,\nBecause it is an enemy to thee.\nHad I it written, I would tear the word.\nJul. My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words\nOf that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound.\nArt thou not Romeo, and a Montague?\nRom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.\nJul. How cam'st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?\nThe orchard walls are high and hard to climb,\nAnd the place death, considering who thou art,\nIf any of my kinsmen find thee here.\nRom. With love's light wings did I o'erperch these walls;\nFor stony limits cannot hold love out,\nAnd what love can do, that dares love attempt.\nTherefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.\nJul. If they do see thee, they will murther thee.\nRom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye\nThan twenty of their swords! Look thou but sweet,\nAnd I am proof against their enmity.\nJul. I would not for the world they saw thee here.\nRom. I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;\nAnd but thou love me, let them find me here.\nMy life were better ended by their hate\nThan death prorogued, wanting of thy love.\nJul. By whose direction found'st thou out this place?\nRom. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire.\nHe lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.\nI am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far\nAs that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,\nI would adventure for such merchandise.\nJul. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face;\nElse would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek\nFor that which thou hast heard me speak to-night.\nFain would I dwell on form- fain, fain deny\nWhat I have spoke; but farewell compliment!\nDost thou love me, I know thou wilt say 'Ay';\nAnd I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,\nThou mayst prove false. At lovers' perjuries,\nThey say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,\nIf thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.\nOr if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,\nI'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,\nSo thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.\nIn truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,\nAnd therefore thou mayst think my haviour light;\nBut trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true\nThan those that have more cunning to be strange.\nI should have been more strange, I must confess,\nBut that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,\nMy true-love passion. Therefore pardon me,\nAnd not impute this yielding to light love,\nWhich the dark night hath so discovered.\nRom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear,\nThat tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops-\nJul. O, swear not by the moon, th' inconstant moon,\nThat monthly changes in her circled orb,\nLest that thy love prove likewise variable.\nRom. What shall I swear by?\nJul. Do not swear at all;\nOr if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,\nWhich is the god of my idolatry,\nAnd I'll believe thee.\nRom. If my heart's dear love-\nJul. Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,\nI have no joy of this contract to-night.\nIt is too rash, too unadvis'd, too sudden;\nToo like the lightning, which doth cease to be\nEre one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!\nThis bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,\nMay prove a beauteous flow'r when next we meet.\nGood night, good night! As sweet repose and rest\nCome to thy heart as that within my breast!\nRom. O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?\nJul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?\nRom. Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.\nJul. I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;\nAnd yet I would it were to give again.\nRom. Would'st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?\nJul. But to be frank and give it thee again.\nAnd yet I wish but for the thing I have.\nMy bounty is as boundless as the sea,\nMy love as deep; the more I give to thee,\nThe more I have, for both are infinite.\nI hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!\n[Nurse] calls within.\nAnon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.\nStay but a little, I will come again. [Exit.]\nRom. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard,\nBeing in night, all this is but a dream,\nToo flattering-sweet to be substantial.\nEnter Juliet above.\nJul. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.\nIf that thy bent of love be honourable,\nThy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,\nBy one that I'll procure to come to thee,\nWhere and what time thou wilt perform the rite;\nAnd all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay\nAnd follow thee my lord throughout the world.\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. I come, anon.- But if thou meanest not well,\nI do beseech thee-\nNurse. (within) Madam!\nJul. By-and-by I come.-\nTo cease thy suit and leave me to my grief.\nTo-morrow will I send.\nRom. So thrive my soul-\nJul. A thousand times good night! Exit.\nRom. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light!\nLove goes toward love as schoolboys from their books;\nBut love from love, towards school with heavy looks.\nEnter Juliet again, [above].\nJul. Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer's voice\nTo lure this tassel-gentle back again!\nBondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud;\nElse would I tear the cave where Echo lies,\nAnd make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine\nWith repetition of my Romeo's name.\nRomeo!\nRom. It is my soul that calls upon my name.\nHow silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,\nLike softest music to attending ears!\nJul. Romeo!\nRom. My dear?\nJul. At what o'clock to-morrow\nShall I send to thee?\nRom. By the hour of nine.\nJul. I will not fail. 'Tis twenty years till then.\nI have forgot why I did call thee back.\nRom. Let me stand here till thou remember it.\nJul. I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,\nRememb'ring how I love thy company.\nRom. And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,\nForgetting any other home but this.\nJul. 'Tis almost morning. I would have thee gone-\nAnd yet no farther than a wanton's bird,\nThat lets it hop a little from her hand,\nLike a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,\nAnd with a silk thread plucks it back again,\nSo loving-jealous of his liberty.\nRom. I would I were thy bird.\nJul. Sweet, so would I.\nYet I should kill thee with much cherishing.\nGood night, good night! Parting is such sweet sorrow,\nThat I shall say good night till it be morrow.\n[Exit.]\nRom. Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!\nWould I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!\nHence will I to my ghostly father's cell,\nHis help to crave and my dear hap to tell.\nExit",

Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set\nOn the fair daughter of rich Capulet;\nAs mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,\nAnd all combin'd, save what thou must combine\nBy holy marriage. When, and where, and how\nWe met, we woo'd, and made exchange of vow,\nI'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,\nThat thou consent to marry us to-day.\nFriar. Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!\nIs Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,\nSo soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies\nNot truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.\nJesu Maria! What a deal of brine\nHath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!\nHow much salt water thrown away in waste,\nTo season love, that of it doth not taste!\nThe sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,\nThy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.\nLo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit\nOf an old tear that is not wash'd off yet.\nIf e'er thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,\nThou and these woes were all for Rosaline.\nAnd art thou chang'd? Pronounce this sentence then:\nWomen may fall when there's no strength in men.\nRom. Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.\nFriar. For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.\nRom. And bad'st me bury love.\nFriar. Not in a grave\nTo lay one in, another out to have.\nRom. I pray thee chide not.

Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline,\nTorments him so that he will sure run mad.\nBen. Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,\nHath sent a letter to his father's house.\nMer. A challenge, on my life.\nBen. Romeo will answer it.\nMer. Any man that can write may answer a letter.\nBen. Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares,\nbeing\ndared.\nMer. Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead! stabb'd with a white\nwench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love song; the\nvery pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's\nbutt-shaft;\nand is he a man to encounter Tybalt?\nBen. Why, what is Tybalt?\nMer. More than Prince of Cats, I can tell you. O, he's the\ncourageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing\npricksong-keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me his\nminim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom! the very\nbutcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist! a gentleman\nof\nthe very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah, the\nimmortal passado! the punto reverse! the hay.\nBen. The what?\nMer. The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting fantasticoes-\nthese\nnew tuners of accent! 'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very\ntall\nman! a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,\ngrandsir, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange\nflies, these fashion-mongers, these pardona-mi's, who stand\nso\nmuch on the new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old\nbench? O, their bones, their bones!\nEnter Romeo.\nBen. Here comes Romeo! here comes Romeo!\nMer. Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how\nart\nthou fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch\nflowed\nin. Laura, to his lady, was but a kitchen wench (marry, she\nhad a\nbetter love to berhyme her), Dido a dowdy, Cleopatra a gypsy,\nHelen and Hero hildings and harlots, This be a gray eye or\nso,\nbut not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, bon jour! There's a\nFrench\nsalutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit\nfairly last night.\nRom. Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?\nMer. The slip, sir, the slip. Can you not conceive?\nRom. Pardon, good Mercutio. My business was great, and in such\na\ncase as mine a man may strain courtesy.\nMer. That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains\na\nman to bow in the hams.\nRom. Meaning, to cursy.\nMer. Thou hast most kindly hit it.\nRom. A most courteous exposition.\nMer. Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.\nRom. Pink for flower.\nMer. Right.\nRom. Why, then is my pump well-flower'd.\nMer. Well said! Follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out\nthy\npump, that, when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may\nremain, after the wearing, solely singular.\nRom. O single-sold jest, solely singular for the singleness!\nMer. Come between us, good Benvolio! My wits faint.\nRom. Swits and spurs, swits and spurs! or I'll cry a match.\nMer. Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done; for\nthou\nhast more of the wild goose in one of thy wits than, I am\nsure, I\nhave in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?\nRom. Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not\nthere\nfor the goose.\nMer. I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.\nRom. Nay, good goose, bite not!\nMer. Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp\nsauce.\nRom. And is it not, then, well serv'd in to a sweet goose?\nMer. O, here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch\nnarrow to an ell broad!\nRom. I stretch it out for that word 'broad,' which, added to\nthe\ngoose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.\nMer. Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now\nart\nthou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou\nart, by\nart as well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a\ngreat natural that runs lolling up and down to hide his\nbauble in\na hole.\nBen. Stop there, stop there!\nMer. Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.\nBen. Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.\nMer. O, thou art deceiv'd! I would have made it short; for I\nwas\ncome to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to\noccupy\nthe argument no longer.\nRom. Here's goodly gear!\nEnter Nurse and her Man [Peter].\nMer. A sail, a sail!\nBen. Two, two! a shirt and a smock.\nNurse. Peter!\nPeter. Anon.\nNurse. My fan, Peter.\nMer. Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the fairer\nface of\nthe two.\nNurse. God ye good morrow, gentlemen.\nMer. God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.\nNurse. Is it good-den?\nMer. 'Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is\nnow\nupon the prick of noon.\nNurse. Out upon you! What a man are you!\nRom. One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.\nNurse. By my troth, it is well said. 'For himself to mar,'\nquoth\n'a? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I may find the\nyoung\nRomeo?\nRom. I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when you\nhave\nfound him than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest\nof\nthat name, for fault of a worse.\nNurse. You say well.\nMer. Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i' faith! wisely,\nwisely.\nNurse. If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.\nBen. She will endite him to some supper.\nMer. A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!\nRom. What hast thou found?\nMer. No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is\nsomething stale and hoar ere it be spent\nHe walks by them and sings.\nAn old hare hoar,\nAnd an old hare hoar,\nIs very good meat in Lent;\nBut a hare that is hoar\nIs too much for a score\nWhen it hoars ere it be spent.\nRomeo, will you come to your father's? We'll to dinner\nthither.\nRom. I will follow you.\nMer. Farewell, ancient lady. Farewell,\n[sings] lady, lady, lady.\nExeunt Mercutio, Benvolio.\nNurse. Marry, farewell! I Pray you, Sir, what saucy merchant\nwas\nthis that was so full of his ropery?\nRom. A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk and\nwill\nspeak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.\nNurse. An 'a speak anything against me, I'll take him down, an\n'a\nwere lustier than he is, and twenty such jacks; and if I\ncannot,\nI'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his\nflirt-gills; I am none of his skains-mates. And thou must\nstand\nby too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure!\nPeter. I saw no man use you at his pleasure. If I had, my\nweapon\nshould quickly have been out, I warrant you. I dare draw as\nsoon\nas another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the\nlaw\non my side.\nNurse. Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me\nquivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word; and, as I told\nyou,\nmy young lady bid me enquire you out. What she bid me say, I\nwill\nkeep to myself; but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead\nher\ninto a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross\nkind of\nbehaviour, as they say; for the gentlewoman is young; and\ntherefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were\nan\nill thing to be off'red to any gentlewoman, and very weak\ndealing.\nRom. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto\nthee-\nNurse. Good heart, and i' faith I will tell her as much. Lord,\nLord! she will be a joyful woman.\nRom. What wilt thou tell her, nurse? Thou dost not mark me.\nNurse. I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I\ntake\nit, is a gentlemanlike offer.\nRom. Bid her devise\nSome means to come to shrift this afternoon;\nAnd there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell\nBe shriv'd and married. Here is for thy pains.\nNurse. No, truly, sir; not a penny.\nRom. Go to! I say you shall.\nNurse. This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.\nRom. And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall.\nWithin this hour my man shall be with thee\nAnd bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,\nWhich to the high topgallant of my joy\nMust be my convoy in the secret night.\nFarewell. Be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains.\nFarewell. Commend me to thy mistress.\nNurse. Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.\nRom. What say'st thou, my dear nurse?\nNurse. Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,\nTwo may keep counsel, putting one away?\nRom. I warrant thee my man's as true as steel.\nNurse. Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord!\nwhen 'twas a little prating thing- O, there is a nobleman in\ntown, one Paris, that would fain lay knife aboard; but she,\ngood\nsoul, had as lieve see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I\nanger\nher sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man;\nbut\nI'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks as pale as any\nclout\nin the versal world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin both\nwith\na letter?\nRom. Ay, nurse; what of that? Both with an R.\nNurse. Ah, mocker! that's the dog's name. R is for the- No; I\nknow\nit begins with some other letter; and she hath the prettiest\nsententious of it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you\ngood\nto hear it.\nRom. Commend me to thy lady.\nNurse. Ay, a thousand times. [Exit Romeo.] Peter!\nPeter. Anon.\nNurse. Peter, take my fan, and go before, and apace.\nExeunt.",

These violent delights have violent ends\nAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,\nWhich, as they kiss, consume. The sweetest honey\nIs loathsome in his own deliciousness\nAnd in the taste confounds the appetite.\nTherefore love moderately: long love doth so;\nToo swift arrives as tardy as too slow.\nEnter Juliet.\nHere comes the lady. O, so light a foot\nWill ne'er wear out the everlasting flint.\nA lover may bestride the gossamer\nThat idles in the wanton summer air,\nAnd yet not fall; so light is vanity.\nJul. Good even to my ghostly confessor.\nFriar. Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.\nJul. As much to him, else is his thanks too much.\nRom. Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy\nBe heap'd like mine, and that thy skill be more\nTo blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath\nThis neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue\nUnfold the imagin'd happiness that both\nReceive in either by this dear encounter.\nJul. Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,\nBrags of his substance, not of ornament.\nThey are but beggars that can count their worth;\nBut my true love is grown to such excess\ncannot sum up sum of half my wealth.\nFriar. Come, come with me, and we will make short work;\nFor, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone\nTill Holy Church incorporate two in one.\n[Exeunt.]",

I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,\n(God save the mark!) here on his manly breast.\nA piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;\nPale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,\nAll in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.\nJul. O, break, my heart! poor bankrout, break at once!\nTo prison, eyes; ne'er look on liberty!\nVile earth, to earth resign; end motion here,\nAnd thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!\nNurse. O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!\nO courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman\nThat ever I should live to see thee dead!\nJul. What storm is this that blows so contrary?\nIs Romeo slaught'red, and is Tybalt dead?\nMy dear-lov'd cousin, and my dearer lord?\nThen, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!\nFor who is living, if those two are gone?\nNurse. Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;\nRomeo that kill'd him, he is banished.\nJul. O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?\nNurse. It did, it did! alas the day, it did!\nJul. O serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!\nDid ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\nBeautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!\nDove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!\nDespised substance of divinest show!\nJust opposite to what thou justly seem'st-\nA damned saint, an honourable villain!\nO nature, what hadst thou to do in hell\nWhen thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend\nIn mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?\nWas ever book containing such vile matter\nSo fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell\nIn such a gorgeous palace!\nNurse. There's no trust,\nNo faith, no honesty in men; all perjur'd,\nAll forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.\nAh, where's my man?

He was not born to shame.\nUpon his brow shame is asham'd to sit;\nFor 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd\nSole monarch of the universal earth.\nO, what a beast was I to chide at him!\nNurse.

I would forget it fain;\nBut O, it presses to my memory\nLike damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds!\n'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo- banished.'\nThat 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'\nHath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death\nWas woe enough, if it had ended there;\nOr, if sour woe delights in fellowship\nAnd needly will be rank'd with other griefs,\nWhy followed not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'\nThy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,\nWhich modern lamentation might have mov'd?\nBut with a rearward following Tybalt's death,\n'Romeo is banished'- to speak that word\nIs father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,\nAll slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished'-\nThere is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\nIn that word's death; no words can that woe sound.\nWhere is my father and my mother, nurse?\nNurse. Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse.\nWill you go to them? I will bring you thither.\nJul. Wash they his wounds with tears? Mine shall be spent,\nWhen theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.\nTake up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil'd,\nBoth you and I, for Romeo is exil'd.\nHe made you for a highway to my bed;\nBut I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.\nCome, cords; come, nurse. I'll to my wedding bed;\nAnd death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!\nNurse. Hie to your chamber. I'll find Romeo\nTo comfort you. I wot well where he is.\nHark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.\nI'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.\nJul.

What is the Prince's doom\nWhat sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand\nThat I yet know not?\nFriar. Too familiar\nIs my dear son with such sour company.\nI bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.\nRom. What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom?\nFriar. A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips-\nNot body's death, but body's banishment.\nRom. Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say 'death';\nFor exile hath more terror in his look,\nMuch more than death. Do not say 'banishment.'\nFriar. Hence from Verona art thou banished.\nBe patient, for the world is broad and wide.\nRom. There is no world without Verona walls,\nBut purgatory, torture, hell itself.\nHence banished is banish'd from the world,\nAnd world's exile is death. Then 'banishment'\nIs death misterm'd. Calling death 'banishment,'\nThou cut'st my head off with a golden axe\nAnd smilest upon the stroke that murders me.\nFriar. O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!\nThy fault our law calls death; but the kind Prince,\nTaking thy part, hath brush'd aside the law,\nAnd turn'd that black word death to banishment.\nThis is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.\nRom. 'Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here,\nWhere Juliet lives; and every cat and dog\nAnd little mouse, every unworthy thing,\nLive here in heaven and may look on her;\nBut Romeo may not. More validity,\nMore honourable state, more courtship lives\nIn carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize\nOn the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand\nAnd steal immortal blessing from her lips,\nWho, even in pure and vestal modesty,\nStill blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;\nBut Romeo may not- he is banished.\nThis may flies do, when I from this must fly;\nThey are free men, but I am banished.\nAnd sayest thou yet that exile is not death?\nHadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,\nNo sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,\nBut 'banished' to kill me- 'banished'?\nO friar, the damned use that word in hell;\nHowling attends it! How hast thou the heart,\nBeing a divine, a ghostly confessor,\nA sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,\nTo mangle me with that word 'banished'?\nFriar. Thou fond mad man, hear me a little speak.\nRom. O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.\nFriar. I'll give thee armour to keep off that word;\nAdversity's sweet milk, philosophy,\nTo comfort thee, though thou art banished.\nRom. Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!\nUnless philosophy can make a Juliet,\nDisplant a town, reverse a prince's doom,\nIt helps not, it prevails not. Talk no more.\nFriar. O, then I see that madmen have no ears.\nRom. How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?\nFriar. Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.\nRom. Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.\nWert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,\nAn hour but married, Tybalt murdered,\nDoting like me, and like me banished,\nThen mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,\nAnd fall upon the ground, as I do now,\nTaking the measure of an unmade grave.\nKnock [within].\nFriar. Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.\nRom. Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,\nMist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knock.\nFriar. Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;\nThou wilt be taken.- Stay awhile!- Stand up; Knock.\nRun to my study.- By-and-by!- God's will,\nWhat simpleness is this.- I come, I come! Knock.\nWho knocks so hard? Whence come you? What's your will?\nNurse. [within] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.\nI come from Lady Juliet.\nFriar. Welcome then.\nEnter Nurse.\nNurse. O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,\nWhere is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?\nFriar. There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.\nNurse. O, he is even in my mistress' case,\nJust in her case!\nFriar. O woeful sympathy!\nPiteous predicament!\nNurse. Even so lies she,\nBlubb'ring and weeping, weeping and blubbering.\nStand up, stand up! Stand, an you be a man.\nFor Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand!\nWhy should you fall into so deep an O?\nRom. (rises) Nurse-\nNurse. Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.\nRom. Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?\nDoth not she think me an old murtherer,\nNow I have stain'd the childhood of our joy\nWith blood remov'd but little from her own?\nWhere is she? and how doth she! and what says\nMy conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?\nNurse. O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;\nAnd now falls on her bed, and then starts up,\nAnd Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,\nAnd then down falls again.\nRom. As if that name,\nShot from the deadly level of a gun,\nDid murther her; as that name's cursed hand\nMurder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,\nIn what vile part of this anatomy\nDoth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack\nThe hateful mansion. [Draws his dagger.]\nFriar. Hold thy desperate hand.\nArt thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art;\nThy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote\nThe unreasonable fury of a beast.\nUnseemly woman in a seeming man!\nOr ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!\nThou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order,\nI thought thy disposition better temper'd.\nHast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?\nAnd slay thy lady that in thy life lives,\nBy doing damned hate upon thyself?\nWhy railest thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?\nSince birth and heaven and earth, all three do meet\nIn thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.\nFie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit,\nWhich, like a usurer, abound'st in all,\nAnd usest none in that true use indeed\nWhich should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.\nThy noble shape is but a form of wax\nDigressing from the valour of a man;\nThy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,\nKilling that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;\nThy wit, that ornament to shape and love,\nMisshapen in the conduct of them both,\nLike powder in a skilless soldier's flask,\nIs set afire by thine own ignorance,\nAnd thou dismemb'red with thine own defence.\nWhat, rouse thee, man! Thy Juliet is alive,\nFor whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.\nThere art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,\nBut thou slewest Tybalt. There art thou happy too.\nThe law, that threat'ned death, becomes thy friend\nAnd turns it to exile. There art thou happy.\nA pack of blessings light upon thy back;\nHappiness courts thee in her best array;\nBut, like a misbehav'd and sullen wench,\nThou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love.\nTake heed, take heed, for such die miserable.\nGo get thee to thy love, as was decreed,\nAscend her chamber, hence and comfort her.\nBut look thou stay not till the watch be set,\nFor then thou canst not pass to Mantua,\nWhere thou shalt live till we can find a time\nTo blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,\nBeg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back\nWith twenty hundred thousand times more joy\nThan thou went'st forth in lamentation.\nGo before, nurse. Commend me to thy lady,\nAnd bid her hasten all the house to bed,\nWhich heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.\nRomeo is coming.\nNurse. O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night\nTo hear good counsel. O, what learning is!\nMy lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.\nRom. Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.\nNurse. Here is a ring she bid me give you, sir.\nHie you, make haste, for it grows very late. Exit.\nRom. How well my comfort is reviv'd by this!\nFriar. Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:\nEither be gone before the watch be set,\nOr by the break of day disguis'd from hence.\nSojourn in Mantua. I'll find out your man,\nAnd he shall signify from time to time\nEvery good hap to you that chances here.\nGive me thy hand. 'Tis late. Farewell; good night.\nRom. But that a joy past joy calls out on me,\nIt were a grief so brief to part with thee.\nFarewell.\nExeunt.",

What is this?\n'Proud'- and 'I thank you'- and 'I thank you not'-\nAnd yet 'not proud'? Mistress minion you,\nThank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,\nBut fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next\nTo go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,\nOr I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.\nOut, you green-sickness carrion I out, you baggage!\nYou tallow-face!\nLady. Fie, fie! what, are you mad?\nJul. Good father, I beseech you on my knees,\nHear me with patience but to speak a word.\nCap. Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!\nI tell thee what- get thee to church a Thursday\nOr never after look me in the face.\nSpeak not, reply not, do not answer me!\nMy fingers itch.

God in heaven bless her!\nYou are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.\nCap. And why, my Lady Wisdom? Hold your tongue,\nGood Prudence. Smatter with your gossips, go!\nNurse. I speak no treason.\nCap. O, God-i-god-en!\nNurse. May not one speak?\nCap. Peace, you mumbling fool!\nUtter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,\nFor here we need it not.\nLady. You are too hot.\nCap. God's bread I it makes me mad. Day, night, late, early,\nAt home, abroad, alone, in company,\nWaking or sleeping, still my care hath been\nTo have her match'd; and having now provided\nA gentleman of princely parentage,\nOf fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,\nStuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,\nProportion'd as one's thought would wish a man-\nAnd then to have a wretched puling fool,\nA whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,\nTo answer 'I'll not wed, I cannot love;\nI am too young, I pray you pardon me'!\nBut, an you will not wed, I'll pardon you.\nGraze where you will, you shall not house with me.\nLook to't, think on't; I do not use to jest.\nThursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:\nAn you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;\nAn you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,\nFor, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,\nNor what is mine shall never do thee good.\nTrust to't. Bethink you. I'll not be forsworn. Exit.\nJul. Is there no pity sitting in the clouds\nThat sees into the bottom of my grief?\nO sweet my mother, cast me not away!\nDelay this marriage for a month, a week;\nOr if you do not, make the bridal bed\nIn that dim monument where Tybalt lies.\nLady. Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.\nDo as thou wilt, for I have done with thee. Exit.\nJul. O God!- O nurse, how shall this be prevented?\nMy husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.\nHow shall that faith return again to earth\nUnless that husband send it me from heaven\nBy leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.\nAlack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems\nUpon so soft a subject as myself!\nWhat say'st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?\nSome comfort, nurse.\nNurse. Faith, here it is.\nRomeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing\nThat he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;\nOr if he do, it needs must be by stealth.\nThen, since the case so stands as now it doth,\nI think it best you married with the County.\nO, he's a lovely gentleman!\nRomeo's a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,\nHath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye\nAs Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,\nI think you are happy in this second match,\nFor it excels your first; or if it did not,\nYour first is dead- or 'twere as good he were\nAs living here and you no use of him.\nJul. Speak'st thou this from thy heart?\nNurse. And from my soul too; else beshrew them both.\nJul. Amen!\nNurse. What?\nJul. Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.\nGo in; and tell my lady I am gone,\nHaving displeas'd my father, to Laurence' cell,\nTo make confession and to be absolv'd.\nNurse. Marry, I will; and this is wisely done. Exit.\nJul. Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!\nIs it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,\nOr to dispraise my lord with that same tongue\nWhich she hath prais'd him with above compare\nSo many thousand times? Go, counsellor!\nThou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.\nI'll to the friar to know his remedy.\nIf all else fail, myself have power to die. Exit.",

My father Capulet will have it so,\nAnd I am nothing slow to slack his haste.\nFriar. You say you do not know the lady's mind.\nUneven is the course; I like it not.\nPar. Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,\nAnd therefore have I little talk'd of love;\nFor Venus smiles not in a house of tears.\nNow, sir, her father counts it dangerous\nThat she do give her sorrow so much sway,\nAnd in his wisdom hastes our marriage\nTo stop the inundation of her tears,\nWhich, too much minded by herself alone,\nMay be put from her by society.\nNow do you know the reason of this haste.\nFriar. [aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.-\nLook, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.\nEnter Juliet.\nPar. Happily met, my lady and my wife!\nJul. That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.\nPar. That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.\nJul. What must be shall be.\nFriar. That's a certain text.\nPar. Come you to make confession to this father?\nJul. To answer that, I should confess to you.\nPar. Do not deny to him that you love me.\nJul. I will confess to you that I love him.\nPar. So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.\nJul. If I do so, it will be of more price,\nBeing spoke behind your back, than to your face.\nPar. Poor soul, thy face is much abus'd with tears.\nJul. The tears have got small victory by that,\nFor it was bad enough before their spite.\nPar. Thou wrong'st it more than tears with that report.\nJul. That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;\nAnd what I spake, I spake it to my face.\nPar. Thy face is mine, and thou hast sland'red it.\nJul. It may be so, for it is not mine own.\nAre you at leisure, holy father, now,\nOr shall I come to you at evening mass?\nFriar. My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.\nMy lord, we must entreat the time alone.\nPar. God shield I should disturb devotion!\nJuliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye.\nTill then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss. Exit.\nJul. O, shut the door! and when thou hast done so,\nCome weep with me- past hope, past cure, past help!\nFriar. Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;\nIt strains me past the compass of my wits.\nI hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,\nOn Thursday next be married to this County.\nJul. Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,\nUnless thou tell me how I may prevent it.\nIf in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,\nDo thou but call my resolution wise\nAnd with this knife I'll help it presently.\nGod join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;\nAnd ere this hand, by thee to Romeo's seal'd,\nShall be the label to another deed,\nOr my true heart with treacherous revolt\nTurn to another, this shall slay them both.\nTherefore, out of thy long-experienc'd time,\nGive me some present counsel; or, behold,\n'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife\nShall play the empire, arbitrating that\nWhich the commission of thy years and art\nCould to no issue of true honour bring.\nBe not so long to speak. I long to die\nIf what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.\nFriar. Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,\nWhich craves as desperate an execution\nAs that is desperate which we would prevent.\nIf, rather than to marry County Paris\nThou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,\nThen is it likely thou wilt undertake\nA thing like death to chide away this shame,\nThat cop'st with death himself to scape from it;\nAnd, if thou dar'st, I'll give thee remedy.\nJul. O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,\nFrom off the battlements of yonder tower,\nOr walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk\nWhere serpents are; chain me with roaring bears,\nOr shut me nightly in a charnel house,\nO'ercover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,\nWith reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;\nOr bid me go into a new-made grave\nAnd hide me with a dead man in his shroud-\nThings that, to hear them told, have made me tremble-\nAnd I will do it without fear or doubt,\nTo live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.\nFriar. Hold, then. Go home, be merry, give consent\nTo marry Paris. Wednesday is to-morrow.\nTo-morrow night look that thou lie alone;\nLet not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.\nTake thou this vial, being then in bed,\nAnd this distilled liquor drink thou off;\nWhen presently through all thy veins shall run\nA cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse\nShall keep his native progress, but surcease;\nNo warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;\nThe roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade\nTo paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall\nLike death when he shuts up the day of life;\nEach part, depriv'd of supple government,\nShall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death;\nAnd in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death\nThou shalt continue two-and-forty hours,\nAnd then awake as from a pleasant sleep.\nNow, when the bridegroom in the morning comes\nTo rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.\nThen, as the manner of our country is,\nIn thy best robes uncovered on the bier\nThou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault\nWhere all the kindred of the Capulets lie.\nIn the mean time, against thou shalt awake,\nShall Romeo by my letters know our drift;\nAnd hither shall he come; and he and I\nWill watch thy waking, and that very night\nShall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.\nAnd this shall free thee from this present shame,\nIf no inconstant toy nor womanish fear\nAbate thy valour in the acting it.\nJul. Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!\nFriar. Hold! Get you gone, be strong and prosperous\nIn this resolve. I'll send a friar with speed\nTo Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.\nJul. Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.\nFarewell, dear father.\nExeunt.",

God knows when we shall meet again.\nI have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins\nThat almost freezes up the heat of life.\nI'll call them back again to comfort me.\nNurse!- What should she do here?\nMy dismal scene I needs must act alone.\nCome, vial.\nWhat if this mixture do not work at all?\nShall I be married then to-morrow morning?\nNo, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.\nLays down a dagger.\nWhat if it be a poison which the friar\nSubtilly hath minist'red to have me dead,\nLest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd\nBecause he married me before to Romeo?\nI fear it is; and yet methinks it should not,\nFor he hath still been tried a holy man.\nI will not entertain so bad a thought.\nHow if, when I am laid into the tomb,\nI wake before the time that Romeo\nCome to redeem me? There's a fearful point!\nShall I not then be stifled in the vault,\nTo whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,\nAnd there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?\nOr, if I live, is it not very like\nThe horrible conceit of death and night,\nTogether with the terror of the place-\nAs in a vault, an ancient receptacle\nWhere for this many hundred years the bones\nOf all my buried ancestors are pack'd;\nWhere bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,\nLies fest'ring in his shroud; where, as they say,\nAt some hours in the night spirits resort-\nAlack, alack, is it not like that I,\nSo early waking- what with loathsome smells,\nAnd shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,\nThat living mortals, hearing them, run mad-\nO, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,\nEnvironed with all these hideous fears,\nAnd madly play with my forefathers' joints,\nAnd pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud,\nAnd, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone\nAs with a club dash out my desp'rate brains?\nO, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost\nSeeking out Romeo, that did spit his body\nUpon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!\nRomeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.\nShe [drinks and] falls upon her bed within the curtains.",

O mischief, thou art swift\nTo enter in the thoughts of desperate men!\nI do remember an apothecary,\nAnd hereabouts 'a dwells, which late I noted\nIn tatt'red weeds, with overwhelming brows,\nCulling of simples. Meagre were his looks,\nSharp misery had worn him to the bones;\nAnd in his needy shop a tortoise hung,\nAn alligator stuff'd, and other skins\nOf ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves\nA beggarly account of empty boxes,\nGreen earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,\nRemnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses\nWere thinly scattered, to make up a show.\nNoting this penury, to myself I said,\n'An if a man did need a poison now\nWhose sale is present death in Mantua,\nHere lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'\nO, this same thought did but forerun my need,\nAnd this same needy man must sell it me.\nAs I remember, this should be the house.\nBeing holiday, the beggar's shop is shut. What, ho!\napothecary!\nEnter Apothecary.\nApoth. Who calls so loud?\nRom. Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.\nHold, there is forty ducats. Let me have\nA dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear\nAs will disperse itself through all the veins\nThat the life-weary taker mall fall dead,\nAnd that the trunk may be discharg'd of breath\nAs violently as hasty powder fir'd\nDoth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.\nApoth. Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law\nIs death to any he that utters them.\nRom. Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness\nAnd fearest to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,\nNeed and oppression starveth in thine eyes,\nContempt and beggary hangs upon thy back:\nThe world is not thy friend, nor the world's law;\nThe world affords no law to make thee rich;\nThen be not poor, but break it and take this.\nApoth. My poverty but not my will consents.\nRom. I pay thy poverty and not thy will.\nApoth. Put this in any liquid thing you will\nAnd drink it off, and if you had the strength\nOf twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.\nRom. There is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,\nDoing more murther in this loathsome world,\nThan these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.\nI sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.\nFarewell. Buy food and get thyself in flesh.\nCome, cordial and not poison, go with me\nTo Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.\nExeunt.",

Search about the\nchurchyard.\nGo, some of you; whoe'er you find attach.\n[Exeunt some of the Watch.]\nPitiful sight! here lies the County slain;\nAnd Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,\nWho here hath lain this two days buried.\nGo, tell the Prince; run to the Capulets;\nRaise up the Montagues; some others search.\n[Exeunt others of the Watch.]\nWe see the ground whereon these woes do lie,\nBut the true ground of all these piteous woes\nWe cannot without circumstance descry.\nEnter [some of the Watch,] with Romeo's Man [Balthasar].\n2. Watch. Here's Romeo's man. We found him in the churchyard.\nChief Watch. Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.\nEnter Friar [Laurence] and another Watchman.\n3. Watch. Here is a friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.\nWe took this mattock and this spade from him\nAs he was coming from this churchyard side.\nChief Watch. A great suspicion! Stay the friar too.\nEnter the Prince [and Attendants].\nPrince. What misadventure is so early up,\nThat calls our person from our morning rest?\nEnter Capulet and his Wife [with others].\nCap. What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?\nWife. The people in the street cry 'Romeo,'\nSome 'Juliet,' and some 'Paris'; and all run,\nWith open outcry, toward our monument.\nPrince. What fear is this which startles in our ears?\nChief Watch. Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;\nAnd Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,\nWarm and new kill'd.\nPrince. Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.\nChief Watch. Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man,\nWith instruments upon them fit to open\nThese dead men's tombs.\nCap. O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!\nThis dagger hath mista'en, for, lo, his house\nIs empty on the back of Montague,\nAnd it missheathed in my daughter's bosom!\nWife. O me! this sight of death is as a bell\nThat warns my old age to a sepulchre.\nEnter Montague [and others].\nPrince. Come, Montague; for thou art early up\nTo see thy son and heir more early down.\nMon. Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night!\nGrief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath.\nWhat further woe conspires against mine age?\nPrince. Look, and thou shalt see.\nMon. O thou untaught! what manners is in this,\nTo press before thy father to a grave?\nPrince. Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,\nTill we can clear these ambiguities\nAnd know their spring, their head, their true descent;\nAnd then will I be general of your woes\nAnd lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,\nAnd let mischance be slave to patience.\nBring forth the parties of suspicion.\nFriar. I am the greatest, able to do least,\nYet most suspected, as the time and place\nDoth make against me, of this direful murther;\nAnd here I stand, both to impeach and purge\nMyself condemned and myself excus'd.\nPrince. Then say at once what thou dost know in this.\nFriar. I will be brief, for my short date of breath\nIs not so long as is a tedious tale.\nRomeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;\nAnd she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife.\nI married them; and their stol'n marriage day\nWas Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death\nBanish'd the new-made bridegroom from this city;\nFor whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin'd.\nYou, to remove that siege of grief from her,\nBetroth'd and would have married her perforce\nTo County Paris. Then comes she to me\nAnd with wild looks bid me devise some mean\nTo rid her from this second marriage,\nOr in my cell there would she kill herself.\nThen gave I her (so tutored by my art)\nA sleeping potion; which so took effect\nAs I intended, for it wrought on her\nThe form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo\nThat he should hither come as this dire night\nTo help to take her from her borrowed grave,\nBeing the time the potion's force should cease.\nBut he which bore my letter, Friar John,\nWas stay'd by accident, and yesternight\nReturn'd my letter back. Then all alone\nAt the prefixed hour of her waking\nCame I to take her from her kindred's vault;\nMeaning to keep her closely at my cell\nTill I conveniently could send to Romeo.\nBut when I came, some minute ere the time\nOf her awaking, here untimely lay\nThe noble Paris and true Romeo dead.\nShe wakes; and I entreated her come forth\nAnd bear this work of heaven with patience;\nBut then a noise did scare me from the tomb,\nAnd she, too desperate, would not go with me,\nBut, as it seems, did violence on herself.\nAll this I know, and to the marriage\nHer nurse is privy; and if aught in this\nMiscarried by my fault, let my old life\nBe sacrific'd, some hour before his time,\nUnto the rigour of severest law.\nPrince. We still have known thee for a holy man.\nWhere's Romeo's man? What can he say in this?\nBal. I brought my master news of Juliet's death;\nAnd then in post he came from Mantua\nTo this same place, to this same monument.\nThis letter he early bid me give his father,\nAnd threat'ned me with death, going in the vault,\nIf I departed not and left him there.\nPrince. Give me the letter. I will look on it.\nWhere is the County's page that rais'd the watch?\nSirrah, what made your master in this place?\nBoy. He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;\nAnd bid me stand aloof, and so I did.\nAnon comes one with light to ope the tomb;\nAnd by-and-by my master drew on him;\nAnd then I ran away to call the watch.\nPrince. This letter doth make good the friar's words,\nTheir course of love, the tidings of her death;\nAnd here he writes that he did buy a poison\nOf a poor pothecary, and therewithal\nCame to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.\nWhere be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,\nSee what a scourge is laid upon your hate,\nThat heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!\nAnd I, for winking at you, discords too,\nHave lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish'd.\nCap. O brother Montague, give me thy hand.\nThis is my daughter's jointure, for no more\nCan I demand.\nMon. But I can give thee more;\nFor I will raise her statue in pure gold,\nThat whiles Verona by that name is known,\nThere shall no figure at such rate be set\nAs that of true and faithful Juliet.\nCap. As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie-\nPoor sacrifices of our enmity!\nPrince. A glooming peace this morning with it brings.\nThe sun for sorrow will not show his head.\nGo hence, to have more talk of these sad things;\nSome shall be pardon'd, and some punished;\nFor never was a story of more woe",
