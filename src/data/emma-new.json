Mr. Weston was\na man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and\npleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with\nwhat self-denying, generous friendship she had always wished and\npromoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her. The want\nof Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She recalled her\npast kindness\u2014the kindness, the affection of sixteen years\u2014how she had\ntaught and how she had played with her from five years old\u2014how she had\ndevoted all her powers to attach and amuse her in health\u2014and how nursed\nher through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of\ngratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years,\nthe equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed\nIsabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a\ndearer, tenderer recollection. She had been a friend and companion such\nas few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing\nall the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and\npeculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of\nhers\u2014one to whom she could speak every thought as it arose, and who had\nsuch an affection for her as could never find fault.\nHow was she to bear the change?\u2014It was true that her friend was going\nonly half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the\ndifference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a\nMiss Taylor in the house; and with all her advantages, natural and\ndomestic, she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual\nsolitude. She dearly loved her father, but he was no companion for her.\nHe could not meet her in conversation, rational or playful.\nThe evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had\nnot married early) was much increased by his constitution and habits;\nfor having been a valetudinarian all his life, without activity of mind\nor body, he was a much older man in ways than in years; and though\neverywhere beloved for the friendliness of his heart and his amiable\ntemper, his talents could not have recommended him at any time.\nHer sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being\nsettled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her daily\nreach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled\nthrough at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from\nIsabella and her husband, and their little children, to fill the house,\nand give her pleasant society again.\nHighbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town,\nto which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and\nname, did really belong, afforded her no equals. The Woodhouses were\nfirst in consequence there. All looked up to them. She had many\nacquaintance in the place, for her father was universally civil, but\nnot one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for\neven half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but\nsigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her father awoke,\nand made it necessary to be cheerful. His spirits required support. He",

Emma smiled and\nchatted as cheerfully as she could, to keep him from such thoughts; but\nwhen tea came, it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had\nsaid at dinner,\n\"Poor Miss Taylor!\u2014I wish she were here again. What a pity it is that\nMr. Weston ever thought of her!\"\n\"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a\ngood-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he thoroughly deserves a\ngood wife;\u2014and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for\never, and bear all my odd humours, when she might have a house of her\nown?\"\n\"A house of her own!\u2014But where is the advantage of a house of her own?\nThis is three times as large.\u2014And you have never any odd humours, my\ndear.\"\n\"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!\u2014We\nshall be always meeting! _We_ must begin; we must go and pay wedding\nvisit very soon.\"\n\"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could\nnot walk half so far.\"\n\"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage,\nto be sure.\"\n\"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a\nlittle way;\u2014and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our\nvisit?\"\n\"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have\nsettled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last\nnight. And as for James, you may be very sure he will always like going\nto Randalls, because of his daughter's being housemaid there. I only\ndoubt whether he will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing,\npapa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you\nmentioned her\u2014James is so obliged to you!\"\n\"I am very glad I did think of her. It was very lucky, for I would not\nhave had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am\nsure she will make a very good servant: she is a civil, pretty-spoken\ngirl; I have a great opinion of her. Whenever I see her, she always\ncurtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you\nhave had her here to do needlework, I observe she always turns the lock\nof the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she will be an\nexcellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor\nto have somebody about her that she is used to see. Whenever James goes\nover to see his daughter, you know, she will be hearing of us. He will\nbe able to tell her how we all are.\"\nEmma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and\nhoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her father tolerably through\nthe evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her own.

            "text": "Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\nsome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\nwell in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr.\nWoodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which\nalways did him good; and his many inquiries after \"poor Isabella\" and\nher children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr.\nWoodhouse gratefully observed, \"It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley,\nto come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must\nhave had a shocking walk.\"\n\"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I\nmust draw back from your great fire.\"\n\"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not\ncatch cold.\"\n\"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them.\"\n\"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain\nhere. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at\nbreakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.\"\n\"By the bye\u2014I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what\nsort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my\ncongratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you\nall behave? Who cried most?\"\n\"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business.\"\n\"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say\n'poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it\ncomes to the question of dependence or independence!\u2014At any rate, it\nmust be better to have only one to please than two.\"\n\"Especially when _one_ of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome\ncreature!\" said Emma playfully. \"That is what you have in your head, I\nknow\u2014and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.\"\n\"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,\" said Mr. Woodhouse, with\na sigh. \"I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.\"\n\"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean _you_, or suppose Mr.\nKnightley to mean _you_. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only\nmyself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know\u2014in a\njoke\u2014it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.\"\nMr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults\nin Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her of them: and\nthough this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she knew it\nwould be so much less so to her father, that she would not have him\nreally suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by\nevery body.\n\"Emma knows I never flatter her,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"but I meant no\nreflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons\nto please; she will now have but one. The chances are that she must be\na gainer.\"\n\"Well,\" said Emma, willing to let it pass\u2014\"you want to hear about the\nwedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved\ncharmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks:\nnot a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that\nwe were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting\nevery day.\"\n\"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,\" said her father. \"But, Mr.\nKnightley, she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am\nsure she _will_ miss her more than she thinks for.\"\nEmma turned away her head, divided between tears and smiles. \"It is\nimpossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,\" said Mr.\nKnightley. \"We should not like her so well as we do, sir, if we could\nsuppose it; but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's\nadvantage; she knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's\ntime of life, to be settled in a home of her own, and how important to\nher to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow\nherself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.\"\n\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma, \"and a\nvery considerable one\u2014that I made the match myself. I made the match,\nyou know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in\nthe right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again,\nmay comfort me for any thing.\"\nMr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, \"Ah! my\ndear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for\nwhatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more\nmatches.\"",

And after such\nsuccess, you know!\u2014Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry\nagain. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who\nseemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied\neither in his business in town or among his friends here, always\nacceptable wherever he went, always cheerful\u2014Mr. Weston need not spend\na single evening in the year alone if he did not like it. Oh no! Mr.\nWeston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a\npromise to his wife on her deathbed, and others of the son and the\nuncle not letting him. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the\nsubject, but I believed none of it.\n\"Ever since the day\u2014about four years ago\u2014that Miss Taylor and I met\nwith him in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he darted\naway with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from\nFarmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the\nmatch from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this\ninstance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off\nmatch-making.\"\n\"I do not understand what you mean by 'success,'\" said Mr. Knightley.\n\"Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately\nspent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring\nabout this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But\nif, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it,\nmeans only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I\nthink it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were\nto marry her,' and saying it again to yourself every now and then\nafterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are\nyou proud of? You made a lucky guess; and _that_ is all that can be\nsaid.\"\n\"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?\u2014I\npity you.\u2014I thought you cleverer\u2014for, depend upon it a lucky guess is\nnever merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor\nword 'success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so\nentirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures;\nbut I think there may be a third\u2014a something between the do-nothing and\nthe do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given\nmany little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might\nnot have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield\nenough to comprehend that.\"\n\"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational,\nunaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their\nown concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than\ngood to them, by interference.\"\n\"Emma never thinks of herself, if she can do good to others,\" rejoined\nMr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. \"But, my dear, pray do not\nmake any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family\ncircle grievously.\"\n\"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr.\nElton, papa,\u2014I must look about for a wife for him. There is nobody in\nHighbury who deserves him\u2014and he has been here a whole year, and has\nfitted up his house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have\nhim single any longer\u2014and I thought when he was joining their hands\nto-day, he looked so very much as if he would like to have the same\nkind office done for him! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is\nthe only way I have of doing him a service.\"\n\"Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good\nyoung man, and I have a great regard for him. But if you want to shew\nhim any attention, my dear, ask him to come and dine with us some day.\nThat will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so\nkind as to meet him.\"\n\"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,\" said Mr. Knightley,\nlaughing, \"and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better\nthing. Invite him to dinner, Emma, and help him to the best of the fish\nand the chicken, but leave him to chuse his own wife. Depend upon it, a\nman of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.\"",

He had received a good education, but, on\nsucceeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed\nfor any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged,\nand had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by\nentering into the militia of his county, then embodied.\nCaptain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his\nmilitary life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great\nYorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was\nsurprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and\nwho were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would\noffend.\nMiss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her\nfortune\u2014though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate\u2014was\nnot to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the\ninfinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off\nwith due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce\nmuch happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had\na husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing\ndue to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him;\nbut though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had\nresolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but\nnot enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's\nunreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home.\nThey lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison\nof Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at\nonce to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.\nCaptain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills,\nas making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of\nthe bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he\nwas rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.",

The boy\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\nmother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\ncreature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\nof the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some\nreluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\nwere overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\ncare and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\nto seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\noccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\nyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,\nrealised an easy competence\u2014enough to secure the purchase of a little\nestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for\u2014enough to\nmarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according\nto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it\nhad not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.",

And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance\nof Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female\nwalking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would\nmake the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the\nevenings in the week together.\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction\u2014her more\nthan satisfaction\u2014her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\nat his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh,\nand saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor!

His own stomach could\nbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as\nunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade\nthem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\nearnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.\nPerry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were\none of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to,\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\nmany\u2014perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.\nThere was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being\nseen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr.",

            "text": "Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his own way. He liked very much to\nhave his friends come and see him; and from various united causes, from\nhis long residence at Hartfield, and his good nature, from his fortune,\nhis house, and his daughter, he could command the visits of his own\nlittle circle, in a great measure, as he liked. He had not much\nintercourse with any families beyond that circle; his horror of late\nhours, and large dinner-parties, made him unfit for any acquaintance\nbut such as would visit him on his own terms. Fortunately for him,\nHighbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in\nthe parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many\nsuch. Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he had some of the\nchosen and the best to dine with him: but evening parties were what he\npreferred; and, unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to\ncompany, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could\nnot make up a card-table for him.\nReal, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and\nby Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege\nof exchanging any vacant evening of his own blank solitude for the\nelegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles\nof his lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.\nAfter these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were\nMrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at\nthe service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and\ncarried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for\neither James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it\nwould have been a grievance.\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\na woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\nevery body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to\nevery body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\nspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\ngossip.",

As a walking\ncompanion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her.\nIn that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her father never\nwent beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed\nhim for his long walk, or his short, as the year varied; and since Mrs.\nWeston's marriage her exercise had been too much confined. She had\nventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet\nSmith, therefore, one whom she could summon at any time to a walk,\nwould be a valuable addition to her privileges. But in every respect,\nas she saw more of her, she approved her, and was confirmed in all her\nkind designs.\nHarriet certainly was not clever, but she had a sweet, docile, grateful\ndisposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be\nguided by any one she looked up to. Her early attachment to herself was\nvery amiable; and her inclination for good company, and power of\nappreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want\nof taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.\nAltogether she was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the\nyoung friend she wanted\u2014exactly the something which her home required.\nSuch a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could\nnever be granted. Two such she did not want. It was quite a different\nsort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was\nthe object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.\nHarriet would be loved as one to whom she could be useful. For Mrs.\nWeston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.",

Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\nher.\"\n\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\nhis own business? He does not read?\"\n\"Oh yes!\u2014that is, no\u2014I do not know\u2014but I believe he has read a good\ndeal\u2014but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\nwindow seats\u2014but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\nthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\nVicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\nChildren of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\ncan.\"\nThe next question was\u2014\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\n\"Oh! not handsome\u2014not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\nKingston. He has passed you very often.\"\n\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\ndo. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\nme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\nBut a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\nas much above my notice as in every other he is below it.\"\n\"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed\nhim; but he knows you very well indeed\u2014I mean by sight.\"\n\"I have no doubt of his being a very respectable young man. I know,\nindeed, that he is so, and, as such, wish him well. What do you imagine\nhis age to be?\"\n\"He was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the\n23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference\u2014which is very odd.\"\n\"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His mother is\nperfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as\nthey are, and if she were to take any pains to marry him, she would\nprobably repent it. Six years hence, if he could meet with a good sort\nof young woman in the same rank as his own, with a little money, it\nmight be very desirable.\"\n\"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he would be thirty years old!\"\n\"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are\nnot born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his fortune\nentirely to make\u2014cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever\nmoney he might come into when his father died, whatever his share of\nthe family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his\nstock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he may\nbe rich in time, it is next to impossible that he should have realised\nany thing yet.\"\n\"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no\nindoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks\nof taking a boy another year.\"\n\"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he does\nmarry;\u2014I mean, as to being acquainted with his wife\u2014for though his\nsisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected\nto, it does not follow that he might marry any body at all fit for you\nto notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly\ncareful as to your associates.

You\nare so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a\ncompanion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a\nwoman feels in the society of one of her own sex, after being used to\nit all her life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She is\nnot the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But on\nthe other hand, as Emma wants to see her better informed, it will be an\ninducement to her to read more herself. They will read together. She\nmeans it, I know.\"\n\"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she was twelve years\nold. I have seen a great many lists of her drawing-up at various times\nof books that she meant to read regularly through\u2014and very good lists\nthey were\u2014very well chosen, and very neatly arranged\u2014sometimes\nalphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she drew up\nwhen only fourteen\u2014I remember thinking it did her judgment so much\ncredit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she may have made\nout a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of\nsteady reading from Emma. She will never submit to any thing requiring\nindustry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the\nunderstanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely\naffirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.\u2014You never could persuade her\nto read half so much as you wished.\u2014You know you could not.\"\n\"I dare say,\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"that I thought so\n_then_;\u2014but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting\nto do any thing I wished.\"\n\"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as _that_,\"\u2014said\nMr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he had done. \"But I,\"\nhe soon added, \"who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must\nstill see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest\nof her family. At ten years old, she had the misfortune of being able\nto answer questions which puzzled her sister at seventeen. She was\nalways quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since\nshe was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In\nher mother she lost the only person able to cope with her. She inherits\nher mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her.\"\n\"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on _your_\nrecommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another\nsituation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to\nany body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.\"\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling. \"You are better placed _here_; very fit for a\nwife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself\nto be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might\nnot give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to\npromise; but you were receiving a very good education from _her_, on\nthe very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and\ndoing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him a\nwife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.\"\n\"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to\nsuch a man as Mr. Weston.\"\n\"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and\nthat with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.\nWe will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness\nof comfort, or his son may plague him.\"\n\"I hope not _that_.\u2014It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not\nforetell vexation from that quarter.\"\n\"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's\ngenius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the\nyoung man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.\u2014But\nHarriet Smith\u2014I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her the\nvery worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She knows\nnothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She is a\nflatterer in all her ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned.\nHer ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she has any\nthing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful\ninferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that _she_\ncannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her out of\nconceit with all the other places she belongs to. She will grow just\nrefined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and\ncircumstances have placed her home. I am much mistaken if Emma's\ndoctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl\nadapt herself rationally to the varieties of her situation in\nlife.\u2014They only give a little polish.\"\n\"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more\nanxious for her present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.\nHow well she looked last night!\"\n\"Oh! you would rather talk of her person than her mind, would you? Very\nwell; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty.\"\n\"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect\nbeauty than Emma altogether\u2014face and figure?\"\n\"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom\nseen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial\nold friend.\"\n\"Such an eye!\u2014the true hazle eye\u2014and so brilliant! regular features,\nopen countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health,\nand such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!\nThere is health, not merely in her bloom, but in her air, her head, her\nglance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;'\nnow, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of\ngrown-up health. She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\"\n\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\" he replied. \"I think her\nall you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise,\nthat I do not think her personally vain. Considering how very handsome\nshe is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies\nanother way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of\nHarriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.\"\n\"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not\ndoing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she is an\nexcellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder\nsister, or a truer friend? No, no; she has qualities which may be\ntrusted; she will never lead any one really wrong; she will make no\nlasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she is in the right a hundred\ntimes.\"\n\"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and\nI will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and\nIsabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind\naffection, and Isabella always thinks as he does; except when he is not\nquite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their\nopinions with me.\"\n\"I know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind;\nbut excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself,\nyou know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's\nmother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any\npossible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a\nmatter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any\nlittle inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be\nexpected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her father, who perfectly\napproves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a",

You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in\nraptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. \"Well, if\nyou give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try\nwhat I can do. Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a\nlikeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the\neye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.\"\n\"Exactly so\u2014The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth\u2014I have\nnot a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it,\nit will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.\"\n\"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She thinks\nso little of her own beauty. Did not you observe her manner of\nanswering me? How completely it meant, 'why should my picture be\ndrawn?'\"\n\"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work\ndirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\nattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\nthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many\nbeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had\nalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\ndrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\nshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;\u2014and drew in almost every\nstyle; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she\napproached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to\ncommand, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as\nto her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\nunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\naccomplishment often higher than it deserved.",

They were both in ecstasies. A\nlikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be\ncapital.\n\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma. \"I had only my own\nfamily to study from. There is my father\u2014another of my father\u2014but the\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!\u2014and\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her\nfour children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\nattempts at three of those four children;\u2014there they are, Henry and\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\ncoarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's\nvery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\nis very good. Then here is my last,\"\u2014unclosing a pretty sketch of a\ngentleman in small size, whole-length\u2014\"my last and my best\u2014my brother,\nMr. John Knightley.\u2014This did not want much of being finished, when I\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I\ncould not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had\nreally made a very good likeness of it\u2014(Mrs. Weston and I were quite\nagreed in thinking it _very_ like)\u2014only too handsome\u2014too flattering\u2014but\nthat was a fault on the right side\"\u2014after all this, came poor dear\nIsabella's cold approbation of\u2014\"Yes, it was a little like\u2014but to be\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in\npersuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;\u2014and, as I said, I did then\nforswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather\nfor my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case _at_\n_present_, I will break my resolution now.\"\nMr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and\nwas repeating, \"No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as\nyou observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\" with so interesting a\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\nstation over the mantelpiece.\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\nto employ him in reading.\n\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith's.\"\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing\nless would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready\nat the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the\nprogress, and be charmed.\u2014There was no being displeased with such an\nencourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\nbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\nhis complaisance were unexceptionable.\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\npleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\nbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\ndestined place with credit to them both\u2014a standing memorial of the\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\nas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising\nattachment was likely to add.",

It is the fault of\nher face that she has them not.\"\n\"Do you think so?\" replied he. \"I cannot agree with you. It appears to\nme a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a\nlikeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know.\"\n\"You have made her too tall, Emma,\" said Mr. Knightley.\nEmma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly\nadded,\n\"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider,\nshe is sitting down\u2014which naturally presents a different\u2014which in short\ngives exactly the idea\u2014and the proportions must be preserved, you know.\nProportions, fore-shortening.\u2014Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of\nsuch a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!\"\n\"It is very pretty,\" said Mr. Woodhouse. \"So prettily done! Just as\nyour drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so\nwell as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she\nseems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her\nshoulders\u2014and it makes one think she must catch cold.\"\n\"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer.\nLook at the tree.\"\n\"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.\"\n\"You, sir, may say any thing,\" cried Mr. Elton, \"but I must confess\nthat I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out\nof doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any\nother situation would have been much less in character. The na\u00efvet\u00e9 of\nMiss Smith's manners\u2014and altogether\u2014Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot\nkeep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.\"\nThe next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a\nfew difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London;\nthe order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose\ntaste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all\ncommissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr.\nWoodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in\nthe fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr.\nElton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert.\n\"Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should\nhe have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was\nimpossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on\nsuch an errand.\"\n\"He was too good!\u2014she could not endure the thought!\u2014she would not give\nhim such a troublesome office for the world,\"\u2014brought on the desired\nrepetition of entreaties and assurances,\u2014and a very few minutes settled\nthe business.\nMr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give\nthe directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its\nsafety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of\nnot being incommoded enough.\n\"What a precious deposit!\" said he with a tender sigh, as he received\nit.\n\"This man is almost too gallant to be in love,\" thought Emma. \"I should\nsay so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of\nbeing in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet\nexactly; it will be an 'Exactly so,' as he says himself; but he does\nsigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could\nendure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.\nBut it is his gratitude on Harriet's account.\"",

A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\"\n\"Oh no;\u2014and it is but a short letter too.\"\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a \"very\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\nher husband could write a good letter.\"\n\"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?\"\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\nadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\nher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\nassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every\nsentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\naccepted after all.\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them\nby speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the\nidea of Mr. Elton.\n\"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\" was said in rather a\nsorrowful tone.\n\"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\nAbbey-Mill.\"\n\"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\nbut at Hartfield.\"\nSome time afterwards it was, \"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would\u2014for\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\nlinen-draper.\"\n\"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\nof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are\nthe only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\nthemselves.\"\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\n\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly. \"I wonder what they are\nall doing\u2014whether his sisters know\u2014if he is unhappy, they will be\nunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"\n\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\nemployed,\" cried Emma. \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\"\n\"My picture!\u2014But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\"\n\"Has he so!\u2014Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\ntheir imaginations all are!\"\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.",

            "text": "\"He is very obliging,\" said Emma; \"but is he sure that Harriet means to\nmarry him?\"\n\"Well, well, means to make her an offer then. Will that do? He came to\nthe Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He knows\nI have a thorough regard for him and all his family, and, I believe,\nconsiders me as one of his best friends. He came to ask me whether I\nthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\nthought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened\nthe night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he would not\nallow much time to pass before he spoke to the lady, and as he does not\nappear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he should be\nat Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she may be detained by a visitor, without\nthinking him at all a tiresome wretch.\"\n\"Pray, Mr. Knightley,\" said Emma, who had been smiling to herself\nthrough a great part of this speech, \"how do you know that Mr. Martin\ndid not speak yesterday?\"\n\"Certainly,\" replied he, surprized, \"I do not absolutely know it; but\nit may be inferred. Was not she the whole day with you?\"\n\"Come,\" said she, \"I will tell you something, in return for what you\nhave told me. He did speak yesterday\u2014that is, he wrote, and was\nrefused.\"\nThis was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr.\nKnightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he\nstood up, in tall indignation, and said,\n\"Then she is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her. What is the\nfoolish girl about?\"\n\"Oh! to be sure,\" cried Emma, \"it is always incomprehensible to a man\nthat a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always\nimagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.\"\n\"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the\nmeaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is\nso; but I hope you are mistaken.\"\n\"I saw her answer!\u2014nothing could be clearer.\"\n\"You saw her answer!\u2014you wrote her answer too. Emma, this is your\ndoing. You persuaded her to refuse him.\"\n\"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not\nfeel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man,\nbut I cannot admit him to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized\nindeed that he should have ventured to address her. By your account, he\ndoes seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever\ngot over.\"\n\"Not Harriet's equal!\" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and\nwith calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, \"No, he is not\nher equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in\nsituation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are\nHarriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any\nconnexion higher than Robert Martin? She is the natural daughter of\nnobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and\ncertainly no respectable relations. She is known only as\nparlour-boarder at a common school. She is not a sensible girl, nor a\ngirl of any information. She has been taught nothing useful, and is too\nyoung and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her age she\ncan have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely\never to have any that can avail her. She is pretty, and she is good\ntempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on\nhis account, as being beneath his deserts, and a bad connexion for him.\nI felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he might do much better;\nand that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he could not do\nworse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to\ntrust to there being no harm in her, to her having that sort of\ndisposition, which, in good hands, like his, might be easily led aright\nand turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on\nher side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there",

It crossed my mind immediately that you\nwould not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\nbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'\"\n\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\nshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\nYou are not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\nsociety.\u2014The sphere in which she moves is much above his.\u2014It would be a\ndegradation.\"\n\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\n\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\nwhom she is brought up.\u2014There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\nis a gentleman\u2014and a gentleman of fortune.\u2014Her allowance is very\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\ncomfort.\u2014That she is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that\nshe associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\ndeny.\u2014She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"\n\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may have\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.\nGoddard's hands to shift as she can;\u2014to move, in short, in Mrs.\nGoddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her friends\nevidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.\nShe desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a\nfriend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition\nbeyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.\nShe had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given\nit. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would\nnever have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not\nbeing disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling\nto address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to\nconceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it\nhe had encouragement.\"\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\nagain.\n\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\nunjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\nher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,\nhowever, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and\ngood-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\nthey are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\nis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\npeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\nphilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\ntill they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\nfaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of\nbeing admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\namong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is\nnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\nsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\ngreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much\nmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such\ntemper, the highest claims a woman could possess.\"\n\"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost\nenough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply\nit as you do.\"\n\"To be sure!\" cried she playfully. \"I know _that_ is the feeling of you\nall. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man\ndelights in\u2014what at once bewitches his senses and satisfies his\njudgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to\nmarry, she is the very woman for you. And is she, at seventeen, just\nentering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at\nbecause she does not accept the first offer she receives? No\u2014pray let\nher have time to look about her.\"\n\"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,\" said Mr. Knightley\npresently, \"though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now\nperceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will\npuff her up with such ideas of her own beauty, and of what she has a\nclaim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her reach will be good\nenough for her. Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of\nmischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations\ntoo high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so\nfast, though she is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may\nchuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very\nfond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity\u2014and most\nprudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they\nmight be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be\nrevealed. Let her marry Robert Martin, and she is safe, respectable,\nand happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry\ngreatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of\nconsequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs.\nGoddard's all the rest of her life\u2014or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is\na girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and\nis glad to catch at the old writing-master's son.\"",

She\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\non Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\n\"Robert Martin has no great loss\u2014if he can but think so; and I hope it\nwill not be long before he does.

He continued,\n\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet's.\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\"\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again. \"If I had\nset my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\"\n\"Good morning to you,\"\u2014said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\nhad given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\naffair, was provoking him exceedingly.\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\nindistinctness in the causes of her's, than in his. She did not always\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\nher opinions were right and her adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley.

The dread\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\nwoman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\nof Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\nsuch a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\nshe was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\nresentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\nmight have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\ndone, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate\ndisposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\nthan otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\nallowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\ninterested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\nthought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\ndoubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\nmight originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree\nof prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\nHarriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child,\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\nenviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\nsure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\nElton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\nspirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal\nmore about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\n\"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\nshe only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\nthink the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton\nhad not his equal for beauty or agreeableness.\"",

How little did I think!\u2014The two Abbots and\nI ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he\nwas going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look\nthrough herself; however, she called me back presently, and let me look\ntoo, which was very good-natured. And how beautiful we thought he\nlooked! He was arm-in-arm with Mr. Cole.\"\n\"This is an alliance which, whoever\u2014whatever your friends may be, must\nbe agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we\nare not to be addressing our conduct to fools.

A\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning\u2014(dropt, we suppose,\nby a fairy)\u2014containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\nit in.\"\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\npart as she proceeded\u2014and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\n\"Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said. Very true.\n'Woman, lovely woman.' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\neasily guess what fairy brought it.\u2014Nobody could have written so\nprettily, but you, Emma.\"\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.\u2014After a little thinking, and a very\ntender sigh, he added,\n\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\nremember nothing;\u2014not even that particular riddle which you have heard\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\nseveral.\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid,\nKindled a flame I yet deplore,\nThe hood-wink'd boy I called to aid,\nThough of his near approach afraid,\nSo fatal to my suit before.\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it\u2014but it is very clever all\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"\n\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.\"\n\"Aye, very true.\u2014I wish I could recollect more of it.\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her\u2014and what\nroom there will be for the children?\"\n\"Oh! yes\u2014she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\nhas;\u2014and there is the nursery for the children,\u2014just as usual, you\nknow. Why should there be any change?\"\n\"I do not know, my dear\u2014but it is so long since she was here!\u2014not since\nlast Easter, and then only for a few days.\u2014Mr. John Knightley's being a\nlawyer is very inconvenient.\u2014Poor Isabella!\u2014she is sadly taken away\nfrom us all!\u2014and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\nTaylor here!\"\n\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"\n\"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\nfirst heard she was going to be married.\"\n\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\nhere.\"\n\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.\u2014But\u2014(in a very depressed tone)\u2014she is\ncoming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\"\n\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer\u2014but it seems a case of\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim",

He sat\nmusing a little while, and then said,\n\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\"\n\"Ah! papa\u2014that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do\nnot think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\nhusband.\"\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\nby the idea of his daughter's attachment to her husband, she\nimmediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\n\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\nchildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"\n\"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"\n\"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\"\n\"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, 'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\nof string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\nthem very often.\"\n\"He appears rough to you,\" said Emma, \"because you are so very gentle\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they\nmisbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\naffectionate father\u2014certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\nfather. The children are all fond of him.\"\n\"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\nvery frightful way!\"\n\"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.\"\n\"Well, I cannot understand it.\"\n\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.\"\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in\npreparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\nhis the consciousness of having made a push\u2014of having thrown a die; and\nshe imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\ndining with him\u2014had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\nconditionally to come.\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged\u2014she\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\npaper from the table, she returned it\u2014\n\"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\nthank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have\nventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not\ntake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first\neight lines.\"\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked\nrather doubtingly\u2014rather confused; said something about\n\"honour,\"\u2014glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open\non the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the\nview of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\n\"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must\nnot be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman's\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\"\n\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\na good deal while he spoke; \"I have no hesitation in saying\u2014at least if\nmy friend feels at all as _I_ do\u2014I have not the smallest doubt that,\ncould he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at\nthe book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as\nthe proudest moment of his life.\"\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a\nsort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\nthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share.",

            "text": "Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\neyes.\u2014Emma's remark was\u2014\n\"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\ndays.\"\u2014Harriet's was\u2014\n\"Oh, what a sweet house!\u2014How very beautiful!\u2014There are the yellow\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"\n\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded,\n\"but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\nthis part of Highbury.\"\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\nher curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\nElton's seeing ready wit in her.\n\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think of any\ntolerable pretence for going in;\u2014no servant that I want to inquire\nabout of his housekeeper\u2014no message from my father.\"\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\nsome minutes, Harriet thus began again\u2014\n\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!\"\u2014\nEmma laughed, and replied,\n\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\nI must find other people charming\u2014one other person at least. And I am\nnot only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\nintention of ever marrying at all.\"\n\"Ah!\u2014so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"\n\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\nnot be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\nmarry, I must expect to repent it.\"\n\"Dear me!\u2014it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"\u2014\n\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\nin love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\nmistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\nfirst and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.\"\n\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\n\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly\u2014so satisfied\u2014so\nsmiling\u2014so prosing\u2014so undistinguishing and unfastidious\u2014and so apt to\ntell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.\"\n\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!\"\n\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\nold maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\ngood fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and\npleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.\"\n\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\ngrow old?\"\n\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman's\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\nenough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\nthat declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\nparent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\nblinder. My nephews and nieces!\u2014I shall often have a niece with me.\"\n\"Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\na hundred times\u2014but are you acquainted?\"\n\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter\nfrom her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\nround and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\na stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\nof nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\ntires me to death.\"\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\n\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\nevery thing else appear!\u2014I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?\"\n\"Very true,\" said Harriet. \"Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\nelse.\"\n\"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\" said\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\ninto the lane again. \"I do not think it will,\" stopping to look once\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\ngreater within.",

I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\"\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet's habits of\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\ncomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from\nthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to\nfetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk\nto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\nhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\ndesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,\nwithout any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\ninvoluntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\nshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\nconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\nback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\nto join them.\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was\nonly giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at\nhis friend Cole's, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton\ncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and\nall the dessert.\n\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\nconsoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love; and\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\ncould but have kept longer away!\"\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\nand fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off\nshort, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged\nto entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself\nto rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\n\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am to\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to\nstop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or\nstring, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house\nand endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they\nwere taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;\nbehind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door\nbetween them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to\nreceive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged\nto leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.\nElton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained\najar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\nhoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the\nadjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It\ncould be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and\nmake her appearance.\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\nhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\nthe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\nHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\nother little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\nserious.\n\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch, and\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\nthem forward to the great event.",

She shewed it to me. I thought it very\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps\u2014\"\n\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\n\"Three-and-twenty!\u2014is he indeed?\u2014Well, I could not have thought it\u2014and\nhe was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\nfly indeed!\u2014and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\ngood, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\n28th\u2014and began, 'My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it\nwas signed 'F. C. Weston Churchill.'\u2014I remember that perfectly.\"",

            "text": "Mr. Knightley was to dine with them\u2014rather against the inclination of\nMr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him in\nIsabella's first day. Emma's sense of right however had decided it; and\nbesides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she had\nparticular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement\nbetween Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him the proper\ninvitation.\nShe hoped they might now become friends again. She thought it was time\nto make up. Making-up indeed would not do. _She_ certainly had not been\nin the wrong, and _he_ would never own that he had. Concession must be\nout of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had\never quarrelled; and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration\nof friendship, that when he came into the room she had one of the\nchildren with her\u2014the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months\nold, who was now making her first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to\nbe danced about in her aunt's arms. It did assist; for though he began\nwith grave looks and short questions, he was soon led on to talk of\nthem all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her arms with\nall the unceremoniousness of perfect amity. Emma felt they were friends\nagain; and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction, and\nthen a little sauciness, she could not help saying, as he was admiring\nthe baby,\n\"What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and\nnieces. As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different;\nbut with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.\"\n\"If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and\nwomen, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings\nwith them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might\nalways think alike.\"\n\"To be sure\u2014our discordancies must always arise from my being in the\nwrong.\"\n\"Yes,\" said he, smiling\u2014\"and reason good. I was sixteen years old when\nyou were born.\"\n\"A material difference then,\" she replied\u2014\"and no doubt you were much\nmy superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the\nlapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal\nnearer?\"\n\"Yes\u2014a good deal _nearer_.\"\n\"But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we\nthink differently.\"\n\"I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by\nnot being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child. Come, my dear Emma,\nlet us be friends, and say no more about it. Tell your aunt, little\nEmma, that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing\nold grievances, and that if she were not wrong before, she is now.\"\n\"That's true,\" she cried\u2014\"very true. Little Emma, grow up a better\nwoman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.\nNow, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. As far as good\nintentions went, we were _both_ right, and I must say that no effects\non my side of the argument have yet proved wrong. I only want to know\nthat Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.\"\n\"A man cannot be more so,\" was his short, full answer.\n\"Ah!\u2014Indeed I am very sorry.\u2014Come, shake hands with me.\"\nThis had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John\nKnightley made his appearance, and \"How d'ye do, George?\" and \"John,\nhow are you?\" succeeded in the true English style, burying under a\ncalmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which\nwould have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the\ngood of the other.\nThe evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards\nentirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella, and\nthe little party made two natural divisions; on one side he and his\ndaughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally\ndistinct, or very rarely mixing\u2014and Emma only occasionally joining in\none or the other.\nThe brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally",

            "text": "of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative,\nand who was always the greater talker. As a magistrate, he had\ngenerally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some\ncurious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the\nhome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next\nyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being\ninteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest\npart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a\ndrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the\ndestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was\nentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler\nmanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any\nthing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of\neagerness.\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\n\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand, and\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\nfive children\u2014\"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early,\nmy dear\u2014and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.\u2014You and I\nwill have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all\nhave a little gruel.\"\nEmma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she did, that both\nthe Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as\nherself;\u2014and two basins only were ordered. After a little more\ndiscourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being\ntaken every evening by every body, he proceeded to say, with an air of\ngrave reflection,\n\"It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South\nEnd instead of coming here. I never had much opinion of the sea air.\"\n\"Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir\u2014or we should not\nhave gone. He recommended it for all the children, but particularly for\nthe weakness in little Bella's throat,\u2014both sea air and bathing.\"\n\"Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her any\ngood; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though\nperhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use\nto any body. I am sure it almost killed me once.\"\n\"Come, come,\" cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, \"I must\nbeg you not to talk of the sea. It makes me envious and miserable;\u2014I\nwho have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear\nIsabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet;\nand he never forgets you.\"\n\"Oh! good Mr. Perry\u2014how is he, sir?\"\n\"Why, pretty well; but not quite well. Poor Perry is bilious, and he\nhas not time to take care of himself\u2014he tells me he has not time to\ntake care of himself\u2014which is very sad\u2014but he is always wanted all\nround the country. I suppose there is not a man in such practice\nanywhere. But then there is not so clever a man any where.\"\n\"And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow? I\nhave a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he will be calling soon. He\nwill be so pleased to see my little ones.\"\n\"I hope he will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask\nhim about myself of some consequence. And, my dear, whenever he comes,\nyou had better let him look at little Bella's throat.\"\n\"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\nWingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.\"\n\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\nto her\u2014and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\nspoken to\u2014\n\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma, \"I\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.\"\n\"Oh! the good Bateses\u2014I am quite ashamed of myself\u2014but you mention them\nin most of your letters. I hope they are quite well. Good old Mrs.\nBates\u2014I will call upon her to-morrow, and take my children.\u2014They are\nalways so pleased to see my children.\u2014And that excellent Miss\nBates!\u2014such thorough worthy people!\u2014How are they, sir?\"\n\"Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a\nbad cold about a month ago.\"\n\"How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\ngeneral or heavy\u2014except when it has been quite an influenza.\"\n\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\nmention. Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy\nas he has very often known them in November. Perry does not call it\naltogether a sickly season.\"\n\"No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it _very_ sickly\nexcept\u2014\n\"Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a\nsickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be. It is a\ndreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!\u2014and the\nair so bad!\"\n\"No, indeed\u2014_we_ are not at all in a bad air. Our part of London is\nvery superior to most others!\u2014You must not confound us with London in\ngeneral, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;\u2014there is\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but\n_we_ are so remarkably airy!\u2014Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\nBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.\"\n\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it\u2014but\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I\nthink you are any of you looking well at present.\"\n\"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you\ndo not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\" turning her eyes with\naffectionate anxiety towards her husband.\n\"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\nvery far from looking well.\"\n\"What is the matter, sir?\u2014Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\n\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\nwell\u2014but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before\nyou left home.\"\n\"My dear Isabella,\"\u2014exclaimed he hastily\u2014\"pray do not concern yourself\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.\"\n\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\"\ncried Emma, \"about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?\"\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\nworse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\n\"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" said Mrs. John Knightley.\u2014\"It is so\nlong since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\nregret excessively on dear Emma's account that she cannot be more at\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\ndelightful companion for Emma.\"\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\n\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\nbetter companion than Harriet.\"\n\"I am most happy to hear it\u2014but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\nvery accomplished and superior!\u2014and exactly Emma's age.\"\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\na great deal to be said\u2014much praise and many comments\u2014undoubting\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe\nPhilippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\ntolerably;\u2014but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\ndangerous opening.\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\nwith tender concern.\u2014The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, \"Ah!\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\ndoes not bear talking of.\" And for a little while she hoped he would\nnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\nhim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\nminutes, however, he began with,\n\"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\ninstead of coming here.\"\n\"But why should you be sorry, sir?\u2014I assure you, it did the children a\ngreat deal of good.\"\n\"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\nhear you had fixed upon South End.\"\n\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\na mistake, sir.\u2014We all had our health perfectly well there, never found\nthe least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,\nand his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\"\n\"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.\u2014Perry\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,\nby what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\nthe sea\u2014a quarter of a mile off\u2014very comfortable. You should have\nconsulted Perry.\"\n\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;\u2014only consider how\ngreat it would have been.\u2014An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\"\n\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.\u2014Better not move at all,\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\nworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\nill-judged measure.\"\nEmma's attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had\nreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\nbrother-in-law's breaking out.\n\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \"would do\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?\u2014at my taking my family to\none part of the coast or another?\u2014I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.\u2014I want his directions no more than\nhis drugs.\" He paused\u2014and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\nsarcastic dryness, \"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\"\n\"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition\u2014\"very\ntrue. That's a consideration indeed.\u2014But John, as to what I was telling\nyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\nyour opinion.\"",

I hope not of a putrid\ninfectious sort. Has Perry seen her? Indeed you should take care of\nyourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.\nWhy does not Perry see her?\"\nEmma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this\nexcess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and\ncare; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she\ncould not wish to reason away, which she would rather feed and assist\nthan not, she added soon afterwards\u2014as if quite another subject,\n\"It is so cold, so very cold\u2014and looks and feels so very much like\nsnow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I\nshould really try not to go out to-day\u2014and dissuade my father from\nventuring; but as he has made up his mind, and does not seem to feel\nthe cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so\ngreat a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr.\nElton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me\na little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and\nwhat fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than\ncommon prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.\"\nMr. Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make;\nwhich was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind\ncare of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her's,\nhe had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;\u2014but Emma,\ntoo eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear\nhim impartially, or see him with clear vision, was very well satisfied\nwith his muttering acknowledgment of its being \"very cold, certainly\nvery cold,\" and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him from\nRandalls, and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet\nevery hour of the evening.",

It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\nplease, every feature works.\"\n\"Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a\ngreat deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\nperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but\nvalue.\"\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \"he seems\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\n\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining me\nto be Mr. Elton's object?\"\n\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration\nnow.\"\n\"Mr. Elton in love with me!\u2014What an idea!\"\n\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\nso or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\"\n\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I\nare very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on, amusing\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\nhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\nwell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\nin want of counsel. He said no more.\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\nshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\neldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\nof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\nown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\nwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\nsevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\nof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\nbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\nwhite world in a very short time.\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\ndiscontent.\n\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when he\nasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\nabsurdity\u2014Actually snowing at this moment!\u2014The folly of not allowing\npeople to be comfortable at home\u2014and the folly of people's not staying\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\nevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\nshould deem it;\u2014and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\nthat he can;\u2014here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\nanother man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;\u2014four horses and\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\nat home.\"",

Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\nprobably heard.\"\n\"Yes\u2014I imagined\u2014that is\u2014I did not\u2014\"\n\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party\nto-day!\"\n\"Dreadful!\u2014Exactly so, indeed.\u2014She will be missed every moment.\"\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer.

How very comfortable they make it;\u2014impossible to feel cold\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\nrendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\ncold afternoon\u2014but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.\u2014Ha!\nsnows a little I see.\"\n\"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal of\nit.\"\n\"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton. \"Quite seasonable; and\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\nyesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\ninvites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\nworst weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week.\nNothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not\nget away till that very day se'nnight.\"\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\nsaid only, coolly,\n\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\"",

But I know they will, because it\nis a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has\na particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite\nthem once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes\nto the point.

I cannot be so sanguine as\nMr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr.\nWeston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter\nstands?\"\n\"Yes\u2014it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs.\nChurchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.\"\n\"My Emma!\" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, \"what is the certainty of\ncaprice?\" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending\nbefore\u2014\"You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means\nso sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his father\nthinks. It depends entirely upon his aunt's spirits and pleasure; in\nshort, upon her temper. To you\u2014to my two daughters\u2014I may venture on the\ntruth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered\nwoman; and his coming now, depends upon her being willing to spare\nhim.\"\n\"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,\" replied\nIsabella: \"and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without\nthe greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered\nperson, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any\nthing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she\nnever had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she would\nhave made them!\"\nEmma wished she had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She should then have\nheard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her, with a degree of unreserve\nwhich she would not hazard with Isabella; and, she really believed,\nwould scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from\nher, excepting those views on the young man, of which her own\nimagination had already given her such instinctive knowledge. But at\npresent there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon\nfollowed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner,\nwas a confinement that he could not endure. Neither wine nor\nconversation was any thing to him; and gladly did he move to those with\nwhom he was always comfortable.\nWhile he talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of\nsaying,\n\"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means\ncertain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant,\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"\n\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\nChurchills' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\njealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\"\n\"He ought to come,\" said Emma. \"If he could stay only a couple of days,\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall\ninto bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she\nwants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_'s being under\nsuch restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if\nhe likes it.\"\n\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\none decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston. \"One ought to\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\nevery thing gives way to her.\"\n\"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\nwhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom\nshe owes nothing at all.\"\n\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\nbe.\"\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied, unless\nhe comes.\"\n\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\" continued Mrs.\nWeston, \"and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance",

Mr. Weston was chatty\nand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\nlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in\nvery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and\nEmma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,\nwith scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\nexpectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\nfriendly smiles.\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend\u2014her fair,\nlovely, amiable friend. \"Did she know?\u2014had she heard any thing about\nher, since their being at Randalls?\u2014he felt much anxiety\u2014he must\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.\" And\nin this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the\nterror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than\non Harriet's\u2014more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\nagain, for the present\u2014to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear\u2014there was no concealing\nit\u2014exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.\nWeston to implore her assistance, \"Would not she give him her\nsupport?\u2014would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss\nWoodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss\nSmith's disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a\npromise\u2014would not she give him her influence in procuring it?\"\n\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless for\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?\u2014Judge between us. Have not I\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.\"\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right\nof first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked\nand offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the\npurpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she\nthought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,\nremoving to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,\nwith a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\nWoodhouse:\n\"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.\nSomething new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\nthrough a storm of snow.\"\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and\nEmma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.",

I admired your spirit;\nand I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow\ncan hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one\nis blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the\nother at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before\nmidnight.\"\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\nshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\nthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\nthat he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\n\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?\u2014what is to be done?\" was Mr.\nWoodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\nTo her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\nHis eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\neager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at\nRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\nthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\n\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she; \"I\ndare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at\nall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my\nshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing\nthat gives me cold.\"\n\"Indeed!\" replied he. \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!\u2014you are prettily shod for walking home,\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.\"\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\nleft the room immediately after his brother's first report of the snow,\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\nexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\nin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\nhence. He had gone beyond the sweep\u2014some way along the Highbury\nroad\u2014the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep\u2014in many places hardly\nenough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,\nbut the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\nbeing soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with\nhim in there being nothing to apprehend.\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father's account, who was\nimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus\u2014\n\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"\n\"I am ready, if the others are.\"\n\"Shall I ring the bell?\"\n\"Yes, do.\"\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.

He was afraid poor Isabella\nwould not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.\nHe did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together\nas they could;\" and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very\nslow and wait for the other carriage.\nIsabella stept in after her father; John Knightley, forgetting that he\ndid not belong to their party, stept in after his wife very naturally;\nso that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second\ncarriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them,\nand that they were to have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate drive. It would not have been\nthe awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure,\nprevious to the suspicions of this very day; she could have talked to\nhim of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but\none. But now, she would rather it had not happened. She believed he had\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\nfound her subject cut up\u2014her hand seized\u2014her attention demanded, and\nMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\nprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\nknown, hoping\u2014fearing\u2014adoring\u2014ready to die if she refused him; but\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\nreally was so. Without scruple\u2014without apology\u2014without much apparent\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\nreplied,\n\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\nyourself\u2014you take me for my friend\u2014any message to Miss Smith I shall be\nhappy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\n\"Miss Smith!\u2014message to Miss Smith!\u2014What could she possibly mean!\"\u2014And\nhe repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\n\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,\u2014but\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,\u2014he\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\nfavourable answer.\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\nreplied,\n\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\nmonth, to Miss Smith\u2014such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\nof observing\u2014to be addressing me in this manner\u2014this is an unsteadiness\nof character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\nsir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\nprofessions.\"\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?\u2014Miss\nSmith!\u2014I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\nexistence\u2014never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\nsorry\u2014extremely sorry\u2014But, Miss Smith, indeed!\u2014Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\ncan think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\nreally, seriously, doubt it. No!\u2014(in an accent meant to be\ninsinuating)\u2014I am sure you have seen and understood me.\"\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this\u2014which of\nall her unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She was too completely\noverpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence\nbeing ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he\ntried to take her hand again, as he joyously exclaimed\u2014\n\"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting\nsilence. It confesses that you have long understood me.\"\n\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing. So far from having\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\nshould have been giving way to any feelings\u2014Nothing could be farther\nfrom my wishes\u2014your attachment to my friend Harriet\u2014your pursuit of\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\nnot your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you\njudged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\nhave never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\nSmith?\u2014that you have never thought seriously of her?\"\n\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn: \"never, I assure you.\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!\u2014Miss Smith is a very good sort of\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\nto\u2014Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!\u2014No, madam, my\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\nI received\u2014\"\n\"Encouragement!\u2014I give you encouragement!\u2014Sir, you have been entirely\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\ntrust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at\npresent.\"\nHe was too angry to say another word; her manner too decided to invite\nsupplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually\ndeep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer,\nfor the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage\nturned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves,\nall at once, at the door of his house; and he was out before another\nsyllable passed.\u2014Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good\nnight. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under\nindescribable irritation of spirits, she was then conveyed to",

            "text": "The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\nand be miserable.\u2014It was a wretched business indeed!\u2014Such an overthrow\nof every thing she had been wishing for!\u2014Such a development of every\nthing most unwelcome!\u2014Such a blow for Harriet!\u2014that was the worst of\nall. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she\nwould gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken\u2014more in\nerror\u2014more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\n\"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne\nany thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me\u2014but poor\nHarriet!\"\nHow she could have been so deceived!\u2014He protested that he had never\nthought seriously of Harriet\u2014never! She looked back as well as she\ncould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\nmisled.\nThe picture!\u2014How eager he had been about the picture!\u2014and the\ncharade!\u2014and an hundred other circumstances;\u2014how clearly they had\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its \"ready\nwit\"\u2014but then the \"soft eyes\"\u2014in fact it suited neither; it was a\njumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\nthick-headed nonsense?\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet's friend.\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\nconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\ndreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\nwas perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need\nbe cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\nor manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\ncould hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\nless allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\nBut\u2014that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\nhim!\u2014should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!\u2014look down\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\npresumption in addressing her!\u2014It was most provoking.\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\nthat the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family\u2014and that the\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\nhad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\nwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\nhe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend\nhim to notice but his situation and his civility.\u2014But he had fancied\nher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\nadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\nhers.\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\nto be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\n\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being very\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\nnot to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;\u2014William Coxe\u2014Oh! no, I\ncould not endure William Coxe\u2014a pert young lawyer.\"\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\nmore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\nbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\nHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\nawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\ndiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing\nresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\nunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\ndreadfully.",

Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his\ndaughter attempted it, and she was therefore safe from either exciting\nor receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered\nwith snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and\nthaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every\nmorning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to\nfreeze, she was for many days a most honourable prisoner.

Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\"\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\ncompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\nthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\nobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body.

She admired him for contriving\nit, though not able to give him much credit for the manner in which it\nwas announced.

The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton\nwould have been too great a distinction.\u2014She never could have deserved\nhim\u2014and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would\nhave thought it possible.\nHer tears fell abundantly\u2014but her grief was so truly artless, that no\ndignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes\u2014and she\nlistened to her and tried to console her with all her heart and\nunderstanding\u2014really for the time convinced that Harriet was the\nsuperior creature of the two\u2014and that to resemble her would be more for\nher own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence\ncould do.\nIt was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and\nignorant; but she left her with every previous resolution confirmed of\nbeing humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of\nher life. Her second duty now, inferior only to her father's claims,\nwas to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her own\naffection in some better method than by match-making. She got her to\nHartfield, and shewed her the most unvarying kindness, striving to\noccupy and amuse her, and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton\nfrom her thoughts.",

It is impossible.\"\n\"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\nto manage.\"\n\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\nmoney\u2014he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\nin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or\nother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\nleave the Churchills.\"\n\"Yes, sometimes he can.\"\n\"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.\"\n\"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\nChurchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\nat others.\"\n\"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill\u2014'Every sacrifice of mere\npleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\nI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\nfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\nshall, therefore, set off to-morrow.'\u2014If he would say so to her at\nonce, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\nopposition made to his going.\"\n\"No,\" said Emma, laughing; \"but perhaps there might be some made to his\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\nuse!\u2014Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\nto your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\nhim!\u2014Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\nloud as he could!\u2014How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\"\n\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration\u2014made, of\ncourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner\u2014would do\nhim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the\npeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\ncan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\nthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\nfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\nwell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\nfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\nhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\nRespect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\nthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\nlittle minds would bend to his.\"\n\"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\nhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\ngreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were\nto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's\nsituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\nrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\nChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\nhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\nTo him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and\nregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\nas you can have, without being so equal, under particular\ncircumstances, to act up to it.\"\n\"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal\nexertion, it could not be an equal conviction.\"\n\"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to\nunderstand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly\nopposing those, whom as child and boy he has been looking up to all his\nlife.\"\n\"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first\noccasion of his carrying through a resolution to do right against the\nwill of others. It ought to have been a habit with him by this time, of\nfollowing his duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for\nthe fears of the child, but not of the man. As he became rational, he\nought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in\ntheir authority. He ought to have opposed the first attempt on their\nside to make him slight his father. Had he begun as he ought, there\nwould have been no difficulty now.\"\n\"We shall never agree about him,\" cried Emma; \"but that is nothing\nextraordinary. I have not the least idea of his being a weak young man:\nI feel sure that he is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly,\nthough in his own son; but he is very likely to have a more yielding,\ncomplying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's\nperfection. I dare say he has; and though it may cut him off from some\nadvantages, it will secure him many others.\"\n\"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he ought to move, and of\nleading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely\nexpert in finding excuses for it. He can sit down and write a fine\nflourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade\nhimself that he has hit upon the very best method in the world of\npreserving peace at home and preventing his father's having any right\nto complain. His letters disgust me.\"\n\"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else.\"\n\"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a\nwoman of her good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's\nplace, but without a mother's affection to blind her. It is on her\naccount that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she must doubly\nfeel the omission. Had she been a person of consequence herself, he\nwould have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he\ndid or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of\nconsiderations? Do you suppose she does not often say all this to\nherself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in\nFrench, not in English. He may be very 'amiable,' have very good\nmanners, and be very agreeable; but he can have no English delicacy\ntowards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about\nhim.\"\n\"You seem determined to think ill of him.\"\n\"Me!\u2014not at all,\" replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; \"I do not\nwant to think ill of him. I should be as ready to acknowledge his\nmerits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely\npersonal; that he is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth,\nplausible manners.\"\n\"Well, if he have nothing else to recommend him, he will be a treasure\nat Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and\nagreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the\nbargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a _sensation_ his\ncoming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the\nparishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest\u2014one object of\ncuriosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak\nof nobody else.\"\n\"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him\nconversable, I shall be glad of his acquaintance; but if he is only a\nchattering coxcomb, he will not occupy much of my time or thoughts.\"\n\"My idea of him is, that he can adapt his conversation to the taste of\nevery body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally\nagreeable. To you, he will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music;\nand so on to every body, having that general information on all\nsubjects which will enable him to follow the lead, or take the lead,\njust as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each;\nthat is my idea of him.\"\n\"And mine,\" said Mr. Knightley warmly, \"is, that if he turn out any\nthing like it, he will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What!\nat three-and-twenty to be the king of his company\u2014the great man\u2014the\npractised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make\nevery body's talents conduce to the display of his own superiority; to\nbe dispensing his flatteries around, that he may make all appear like\nfools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could\nnot endure such a puppy when it came to the point.\"\n\"I will say no more about him,\" cried Emma, \"you turn every thing to\nevil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him; and we have no\nchance of agreeing till he is really here.\"\n\"Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced.\"\n\"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love\nfor Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his favour.\"\n\"He is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,\" said\nMr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately\ntalk of something else, though she could not comprehend why he should\nbe angry.",
