An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most\nnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so\nextra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest\nof it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to\nmatch for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his\nbest homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece\nunder twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to\nsaddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this\ngentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit,\nspare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They\nwill have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some\ndifference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject),\nalthough from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called\nQuexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it\nwill be enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the\ntelling of it.",

As he said to\nhimself, \"If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some\ngiant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and\noverthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or,\nin short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have someone\nI may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his\nknees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, 'I\nam the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania,\nvanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before\nyour Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure'?\" Oh,\nhow our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially\nwhen he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There was, so the\nstory goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl\nwith whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known,\nshe never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was\nAldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of\nLady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not\nbe out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of\na princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del\nToboso\u2014she being of El Toboso\u2014a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon,\nand significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself\nand the things belonging to him.",

So, without giving notice of his intention to\nanyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning\nof the day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he\ndonned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet\non, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the\nyard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and\nsatisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his\ngrand purpose.

It occurred to him that he\nhad not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry\nhe neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that\neven if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white\narmour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had\nearned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but his\ncraze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to have\nhimself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the\nexample of others in the same case, as he had read in the books that\nbrought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the\nfirst opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and\nso comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse\nchose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.",

As he had\nalready told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was\nit needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the\nceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay\nin the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be\nadministered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all\nthat was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were\nsatisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than\nfour about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there\nready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as\npossible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed\nknight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle,\nexcept such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.\nThus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in\nwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the\ncarriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels\nalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him\nkneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating\nsome devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand\nand gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a\nsmart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth\nas if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of\nthe ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great\nself-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a\nburst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had\nalready seen of the novice knight's prowess kept their laughter within\nbounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, \"May\nGod make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in\nbattle.\" Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that\ntime forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had\nreceived, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he\nacquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that\nshe was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of\nToledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she\nmight be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said\nin reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed\nthe \"Don\" and called herself Do\u00f1a Tolosa. She promised she would, and\nthen the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the\nsame conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and\nshe said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a\nrespectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote\nrequested that she would adopt the \"Don\" and call herself Do\u00f1a\nMolinera, making offers to her further services and favours.\nHaving thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these\nnever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw\nhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and\nsaddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he\nreturned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in\nlanguage so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it\nor report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no\nless rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him\nto pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.",

Don Quixote decided upon taking the same route and road\nhe had taken on his first journey, that over the Campo de Montiel,\nwhich he travelled with less discomfort than on the last occasion, for,\nas it was early morning and the rays of the sun fell on them obliquely,\nthe heat did not distress them.\nAnd now said Sancho Panza to his master, \"Your worship will take care,\nSe\u00f1or Knight-errant, not to forget about the island you have promised\nme, for be it ever so big I'll be equal to governing it.\"\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Thou must know, friend Sancho Panza,\nthat it was a practice very much in vogue with the knights-errant of\nold to make their squires governors of the islands or kingdoms they\nwon, and I am determined that there shall be no failure on my part in\nso liberal a custom; on the contrary, I mean to improve upon it, for\nthey sometimes, and perhaps most frequently, waited until their squires\nwere old, and then when they had had enough of service and hard days\nand worse nights, they gave them some title or other, of count, or at\nthe most marquis, of some valley or province more or less; but if thou\nlivest and I live, it may well be that before six days are over, I may\nhave won some kingdom that has others dependent upon it, which will be\njust the thing to enable thee to be crowned king of one of them. Nor\nneedst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the\nlot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might\neasily give thee even more than I promise thee.\"\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho Panza, \"if I should become a king by one of\nthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old\nwoman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\"\n\"Well, who doubts it?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I doubt it,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"because for my part I am persuaded\nthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them\nwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, se\u00f1or, she is\nnot worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and\nthat only with God's help.\"\n\"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for he will give her\nwhat suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come\nto be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\"\n\"I will not, se\u00f1or,\" answered Sancho, \"specially as I have a man of\nsuch quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me\nall that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\"",

In the coach there\nwas, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where\nher husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an\nappointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road,\nwere not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he\nsaid to his squire, \"Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the\nmost famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies\nwe see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off\nsome stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo\nthis wrong.\"\n\"This will be worse than the windmills,\" said Sancho. \"Look, se\u00f1or;\nthose are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some\ntravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don't let\nthe devil mislead you.\"\n\"I have told thee already, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that on the\nsubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as\nthou shalt see presently.\"\nSo saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road\nalong which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had\ncome near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \"Devilish and\nunnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you\nare carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy\ndeath as the just punishment of your evil deeds.\"\nThe friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don\nQuixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, \"Se\u00f1or\nCaballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St.\nBenedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are\nany captive princesses coming in this coach.\"\n\"No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\" said Don\nQuixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with\nlevelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and\ndetermination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule,\nhe would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore\nwounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his\ncomrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made\noff across the country faster than the wind.\nSancho Panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly\nfrom his ass, rushed towards him and began to strip off his gown. At\nthat instant the friars' muleteers came up and asked what he was\nstripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully\nas spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The\nmuleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this\nabout battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off\ntalking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him\ndown, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks\nand left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and\nwithout any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling,\nterrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred\nafter his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on,\nwatching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the\nend of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more\ncrosses than if they had the devil after them.",

      "text": "Don Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:\n\"Your beauty, lady mine,\" said he, \"may now dispose of your person as\nmay be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your\nravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine;\nand lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know\nthat I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and\nadventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del\nToboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no\nmore than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present\nyourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you\nfree.\"\nOne of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was\nlistening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would\nnot allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to\nEl Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad\nCastilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \"Begone, caballero, and\nill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,\nslayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\"\nDon Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly,\n\"If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already\nchastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.\" To which the\nBiscayan returned, \"I no gentleman!\u2014I swear to God thou liest as I am\nChristian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou\nsee thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at\nsea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou\nliest.\"\n\"'\"You will see presently,\" said Agrajes,'\" replied Don Quixote; and\nthrowing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler\non his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\nThe Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount\nfrom his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for\nhire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was\nlucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was\nable to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at\none another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove\nto make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in\nhis disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he\nwould kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The\nlady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the\ncoachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe\nstruggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a\nmighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given\nto one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote,\nfeeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, \"O\nlady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this\nyour knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds\nhimself in this extreme peril.\" To say this, to lift his sword, to\nshelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was\nthe work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a\nsingle blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was\nconvinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to\nfollow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of\nhis cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his\nmule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could\nnot stir a step.\nOn, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan,\nwith uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half,\nwhile on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under\nthe protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting\nin suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the\nlady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand\nvows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God\nmight deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which\nthey found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis\nthe author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as\nexcuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements\nof Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true the\nsecond author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so\ncurious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion,\nor that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to\npreserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to\nthis famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despair\nof finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven\nfavouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second",

The discovery of it occurred in this way.\nOne day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some\npamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading\neven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent\nof mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw\nthat it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was\nunable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to\nsee if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for\nme; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter,\nfor even had I sought one for an older and better language I should\nhave found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I told\nhim what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in the\nmiddle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked him\nwhat he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something the\nbook had written in the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it to\nme; and he still laughing said, \"In the margin, as I told you, this is\nwritten: '_This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history,\nhad, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for salting\npigs_.'\"\nWhen I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and\namazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained\nthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the\nbeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he\ntold me it meant, \"_History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid\nHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian_.\" It required great caution to\nhide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and\nsnatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and\npamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits\nabout him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safely\ncalculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at\nonce with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and begged\nhim to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the\nCastilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering\nhim whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas of\nraisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them\nfaithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and\nnot to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my\nhouse, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the",

      "text": "In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan\nwas drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the\nhistory describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his\nbuckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true to\nnature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The\nBiscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, \"_Don Sancho de\nAzpeitia_,\" which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of\nRocinante was another that said, \"_Don Quixote_.\" Rocinante was\nmarvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with so\nmuch backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainly\nwith what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been\nbestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his\nass, at whose feet was another label that said, \"Sancho Zancas,\" and\naccording to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body,\nand long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and\nZancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history several\ntimes calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned,\nbut they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the\ntrue relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it\nis true.\nIf against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its\ntruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very\ncommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such\nenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather\nthan additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion;\nfor, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so\nworthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in\nsilence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business\nand duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from\npassion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make\nthem swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of\ntime, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel\nfor the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will be\nfound all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting\nin any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an\nauthor and not the fault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part,\naccording to the translation, began in this way:\nWith trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though\nthe two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and\nearth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear\nthemselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which\nwas delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in\nits course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the\nbitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good\nfortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword\nof his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder,\nit did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour,\ncarrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all\nwhich with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry\nplight.",

And though it\nis plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other\nnatural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it\nis plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives\nthrough woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would\nbe rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend\nSancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to\nmake a new world or pervert knight-errantry.\"\n\"Pardon me, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"for, as I cannot read or\nwrite, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of\nthe profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with\nevery kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for\nmyself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other\nthings more substantial.\"\n\"I do not say, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that it is imperative on\nknights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest\nof; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs\nthey found in the fields which they knew and I know too.\"\n\"A good thing it is,\" answered Sancho, \"to know those herbs, for to my\nthinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into\npractice.\"\nAnd here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their\nrepast peaceably and sociably.

      "text": "He was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and Sancho, having as best\nhe could put up Rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that\ncame from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire;\nand though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be\ntransferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as\nthe goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the\nground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty\ngood-will invited them both to share what they had. Round the skins six\nof the men belonging to the fold seated themselves, having first with\nrough politeness pressed Don Quixote to take a seat upon a trough which\nthey placed for him upside down. Don Quixote seated himself, and Sancho\nremained standing to serve the cup, which was made of horn. Seeing him\nstanding, his master said to him:\n\"That thou mayest see, Sancho, the good that knight-errantry contains\nin itself, and how those who fill any office in it are on the high road\nto be speedily honoured and esteemed by the world, I desire that thou\nseat thyself here at my side and in the company of these worthy people,\nand that thou be one with me who am thy master and natural lord, and\nthat thou eat from my plate and drink from whatever I drink from; for\nthe same may be said of knight-errantry as of love, that it levels\nall.\"\n\"Great thanks,\" said Sancho, \"but I may tell your worship that provided\nI have enough to eat, I can eat it as well, or better, standing, and by\nmyself, than seated alongside of an emperor. And indeed, if the truth\nis to be told, what I eat in my corner without form or fuss has much\nmore relish for me, even though it be bread and onions, than the\nturkeys of those other tables where I am forced to chew slowly, drink\nlittle, wipe my mouth every minute, and cannot sneeze or cough if I\nwant or do other things that are the privileges of liberty and\nsolitude. So, se\u00f1or, as for these honours which your worship would put\nupon me as a servant and follower of knight-errantry, exchange them for\nother things which may be of more use and advantage to me; for these,\nthough I fully acknowledge them as received, I renounce from this\nmoment to the end of the world.\"\n\"For all that,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou must seat thyself, because him\nwho humbleth himself God exalteth;\" and seizing him by the arm he\nforced him to sit down beside himself.\nThe goatherds did not understand this jargon about squires and\nknights-errant, and all they did was to eat in silence and stare at\ntheir guests, who with great elegance and appetite were stowing away\npieces as big as one's fist. The course of meat finished, they spread\nupon the sheepskins a great heap of parched acorns, and with them they\nput down a half cheese harder than if it had been made of mortar. All\nthis while the horn was not idle, for it went round so constantly, now\nfull, now empty, like the bucket of a water-wheel, that it soon drained\none of the two wine-skins that were in sight. When Don Quixote had\nquite appeased his appetite he took up a handful of the acorns, and\ncontemplating them attentively delivered himself somewhat in this\nfashion:\n\"Happy the age, happy the time, to which the ancients gave the name of\ngolden, not because in that fortunate age the gold so coveted in this\nour iron one was gained without toil, but because they that lived in it\nknew not the two words \"_mine_\" and \"_thine_\"! In that blessed age all\nthings were in common; to win the daily food no labour was required of\nany save to stretch forth his hand and gather it from the sturdy oaks\nthat stood generously inviting him with their sweet ripe fruit. The\nclear streams and running brooks yielded their savoury limpid waters in\nnoble abundance. The busy and sagacious bees fixed their republic in\nthe clefts of the rocks and hollows of the trees, offering without\nusance the plenteous produce of their fragrant toil to every hand. The\nmighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the\nbroad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by\nrude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then\nall was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of\nthe crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels\nof our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion\nof her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight\nthe children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and\nfair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with\nflowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover\nwhat modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments\nlike those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured\nin endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy,\nwherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames\nwith all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has\ntaught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves\nsimply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend\nthemselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malice\nhad then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her\nground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of\ninterest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary\nlaw had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then\nthere was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and\nmodesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without\nfear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were\nundone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful\nage of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of\nCrete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry\nwill make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of\nits accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to\nruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased,\nthe order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to\nprotect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this order\nI belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the\nhospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by\nnatural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet,\nseeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and\nfeasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I\nshould thank you for yours.\"",

Sancho likewise held his peace and ate\nacorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they\nhad hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.\nDon Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the\nend of which one of the goatherds said, \"That your worship, se\u00f1or\nknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality\nwith ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making\none of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very\nintelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and\nwrite and play on the rebeck to perfection.\"\nThe goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck\nreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very\ngood-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him\nif he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already\nmade the offer said to him:\n\"In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of\nsinging a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in\nthe mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy\naccomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say\ntrue; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy\nlove that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much\nliked in the town.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said the young man, and without waiting for more\npressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his\nrebeck, presently began to sing to these words.\nANTONIO'S BALLAD\nThou dost love me well, Olalla;\nWell I know it, even though\nLove's mute tongues, thine eyes, have never\nBy their glances told me so.\nFor I know my love thou knowest,\nTherefore thine to claim I dare:\nOnce it ceases to be secret,\nLove need never feel despair.\nTrue it is, Olalla, sometimes\nThou hast all too plainly shown\nThat thy heart is brass in hardness,\nAnd thy snowy bosom stone.\nYet for all that, in thy coyness,\nAnd thy fickle fits between,\nHope is there\u2014at least the border\nOf her garment may be seen.\nLures to faith are they, those glimpses,\nAnd to faith in thee I hold;\nKindness cannot make it stronger,\nColdness cannot make it cold.\nIf it be that love is gentle,\nIn thy gentleness I see\nSomething holding out assurance\nTo the hope of winning thee.\nIf it be that in devotion\nLies a power hearts to move,\nThat which every day I show thee,\nHelpful to my suit should prove.\nMany a time thou must have noticed\u2014\nIf to notice thou dost care\u2014\nHow I go about on Monday\nDressed in all my Sunday wear.\nLove's eyes love to look on brightness;\nLove loves what is gaily drest;\nSunday, Monday, all I care is\nThou shouldst see me in my best.\nNo account I make of dances,\nOr of strains that pleased thee so,\nKeeping thee awake from midnight\nTill the cocks began to crow;\nOr of how I roundly swore it\nThat there's none so fair as thou;\nTrue it is, but as I said it,\nBy the girls I'm hated now.\nFor Teresa of the hillside\nAt my praise of thee was sore;\nSaid, \"You think you love an angel;\nIt's a monkey you adore;\n\"Caught by all her glittering trinkets,\nAnd her borrowed braids of hair,\nAnd a host of made-up beauties\nThat would Love himself ensnare.\"\n'Twas a lie, and so I told her,\nAnd her cousin at the word\nGave me his defiance for it;\nAnd what followed thou hast heard.\nMine is no high-flown affection,\nMine no passion _par amours_\u2014\nAs they call it\u2014what I offer\nIs an honest love, and pure.\nCunning cords the holy Church has,\nCords of softest silk they be;\nPut thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;\nMine will follow, thou wilt see.\nElse\u2014and once for all I swear it\nBy the saint of most renown\u2014\nIf I ever quit the mountains,\n'Twill be in a friar's gown.\nHere the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote\nentreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more\ninclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his\nmaster, \"Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to\npass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not\nallow them to spend the night in singing.\"\n\"I understand thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"I perceive clearly\nthat those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather\nthan in music.\"\n\"It's sweet to us all, blessed be God,\" said Sancho.\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but settle thyself where thou\nwilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than\nin sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear\nfor me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.\"\nSancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,\ntold him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it\nwould be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which\nthere was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a\nlittle salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a\nbandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so",

      "text": "Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the\nshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead\nman was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,\nwho had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which\nhe returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned\nand deeply read. \"Above all, they said, he was learned in the science\nof the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and\nthe moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact\ntime.\"\n\"Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two\nluminaries,\" said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with\ntrifles, went on with his story, saying, \"Also he foretold when the\nyear was going to be one of abundance or estility.\"\n\"Sterility, you mean,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Sterility or estility,\" answered Pedro, \"it is all the same in the\nend. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who\nbelieved him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,\nbidding them 'sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow\npulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and the\nthree following not a drop will be got.'\"\n\"That science is called astrology,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I do not know what it is called,\" replied Pedro, \"but I know that he\nknew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months\nhad passed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared\ndressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the\nlong gown he wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend,\nAmbrosio by name, who had been his companion in his studies, took to\nthe shepherd's dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is\ndead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he made\ncarols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young\nmen of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When the\nvillagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd's\ndress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them\nto make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our\nChrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in\nchattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a\nlarge sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute\nowner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good\ncomrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a\ncountenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he\nhad changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these\nwastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,\nwith whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell\nyou now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps,\nand even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it\nall the days of your life, though you should live more years than\nsarna.\"\n\"Say Sarra,\" said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's\nconfusion of words.\n\"The sarna lives long enough,\" answered Pedro; \"and if, se\u00f1or, you must\ngo finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of\nit this twelvemonth.\"\n\"Pardon me, friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"but, as there is such a\ndifference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have\nanswered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue\nyour story, and I will not object any more to anything.\"\n\"I say then, my dear sir,\" said the goatherd, \"that in our village\nthere was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was\nnamed Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great\nwealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected\nwoman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with\nthat countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the\nother; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust\nthat at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other\nworld. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a\nwife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an\nuncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up\nwith such beauty that it reminded us of her mother's, which was very\ngreat, and yet it was thought that the daughter's would exceed it; and\nso when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld\nher but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater\nnumber were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in\ngreat seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great\nbeauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her\nuncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not\nonly by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the\npersons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man,\nthough he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old\nenough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any\neye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl's property\nbrought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in\npraise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would\nhave you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is\ntalked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am,\nthat the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners\nto speak well of him, especially in villages.\"\n\"That is the truth,\" said Don Quixote; \"but go on, for the story is\nvery good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\"\n\"May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\" said Pedro; \"that is the\none to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before\nhis niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular\nof the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and\nmake a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other\nanswer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so\nyoung she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At\nthese, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle\nceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in\nage and could mate herself to her own liking. For, said he\u2014and he said\nquite right\u2014parents are not to settle children in life against their\nwill. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day the\ndemure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite\nof her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her,\ntook to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village,\nand tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, and\nher beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many\nrich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of\nChrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these,\nas has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say\nthat he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, because\nMarcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little\nor rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even the\nsemblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the\ncontrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches\nover her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has\nboasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope\nhowever small of obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoid\nor shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them\ncourteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare his\nintention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that of\nmatrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kind\nof disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague\nhad got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts\nof those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but her\nscorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they\nknow not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted,\nand other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her\ncharacter; and if you should remain here any time, se\u00f1or, you would\nhear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the\nrejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where\nthere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of\nthem but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela,\nand above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover\nwould say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human\nbeauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there\nlove songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the\nhours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there,\nwithout having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the\nmorning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief or\nrespite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of\nthe sultry summer noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate\nheavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautiful\nMarcela triumphs free and careless. And all of us that know her are\nwaiting to see what her pride will come to, and who is to be the happy\nman that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining\npossession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have told you being such\nwell-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the cause\nof Chrysostom's death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I advise\nyou, se\u00f1or, fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial, which will\nbe well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is not\nhalf a league from this place to where he directed he should be\nburied.\"",

Don Quixote, who desired\nnothing better, rose and ordered Sancho to saddle and pannel at once,\nwhich he did with all despatch, and with the same they all set out\nforthwith. They had not gone a quarter of a league when at the meeting\nof two paths they saw coming towards them some six shepherds dressed in\nblack sheepskins and with their heads crowned with garlands of cypress\nand bitter oleander. Each of them carried a stout holly staff in his\nhand, and along with them there came two men of quality on horseback in\nhandsome travelling dress, with three servants on foot accompanying\nthem. Courteous salutations were exchanged on meeting, and inquiring\none of the other which way each party was going, they learned that all\nwere bound for the scene of the burial, so they went on all together.",

The traveller answered that the same morning they had met\nthese shepherds, and seeing them dressed in this mournful fashion they\nhad asked them the reason of their appearing in such a guise; which one\nof them gave, describing the strange behaviour and beauty of a\nshepherdess called Marcela, and the loves of many who courted her,\ntogether with the death of that Chrysostom to whose burial they were\ngoing. In short, he repeated all that Pedro had related to Don Quixote.\nThis conversation dropped, and another was commenced by him who was\ncalled Vivaldo asking Don Quixote what was the reason that led him to\ngo armed in that fashion in a country so peaceful. To which Don Quixote\nreplied, \"The pursuit of my calling does not allow or permit me to go\nin any other fashion; easy life, enjoyment, and repose were invented\nfor soft courtiers, but toil, unrest, and arms were invented and made\nfor those alone whom the world calls knights-errant, of whom I, though\nunworthy, am the least of all.\"\nThe instant they heard this all set him down as mad, and the better to\nsettle the point and discover what kind of madness his was, Vivaldo\nproceeded to ask him what knights-errant meant.\n\"Have not your worships,\" replied Don Quixote, \"read the annals and\nhistories of England, in which are recorded the famous deeds of King\nArthur, whom we in our popular Castilian invariably call King Artus,\nwith regard to whom it is an ancient tradition, and commonly received\nall over that kingdom of Great Britain, that this king did not die, but\nwas changed by magic art into a raven, and that in process of time he\nis to return to reign and recover his kingdom and sceptre; for which\nreason it cannot be proved that from that time to this any Englishman\never killed a raven? Well, then, in the time of this good king that\nfamous order of chivalry of the Knights of the Round Table was\ninstituted, and the amour of Don Lancelot of the Lake with the Queen\nGuinevere occurred, precisely as is there related, the go-between and\nconfidante therein being the highly honourable dame Quinta\u00f1ona, whence\ncame that ballad so well known and widely spread in our Spain\u2014\nO never surely was there knight\nSo served by hand of dame,\nAs served was he Sir Lancelot hight\nWhen he from Britain came\u2014\nwith all the sweet and delectable course of his achievements in love",

      "text": "between two high mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in\nsheepskins of black wool, and crowned with garlands which, as\nafterwards appeared, were, some of them of yew, some of cypress. Six of\nthe number were carrying a bier covered with a great variety of flowers\nand branches, on seeing which one of the goatherds said, \"Those who\ncome there are the bearers of Chrysostom's body, and the foot of that\nmountain is the place where he ordered them to bury him.\" They\ntherefore made haste to reach the spot, and did so by the time those\nwho came had laid the bier upon the ground, and four of them with sharp\npickaxes were digging a grave by the side of a hard rock. They greeted\neach other courteously, and then Don Quixote and those who accompanied\nhim turned to examine the bier, and on it, covered with flowers, they\nsaw a dead body in the dress of a shepherd, to all appearance of one\nthirty years of age, and showing even in death that in life he had been\nof comely features and gallant bearing. Around him on the bier itself\nwere laid some books, and several papers open and folded; and those who\nwere looking on as well as those who were opening the grave and all the\nothers who were there preserved a strange silence, until one of those\nwho had borne the body said to another, \"Observe carefully, Ambrosio if\nthis is the place Chrysostom spoke of, since you are anxious that what\nhe directed in his will should be so strictly complied with.\"\n\"This is the place,\" answered Ambrosio \"for in it many a time did my\npoor friend tell me the story of his hard fortune. Here it was, he told\nme, that he saw for the first time that mortal enemy of the human race,\nand here, too, for the first time he declared to her his passion, as\nhonourable as it was devoted, and here it was that at last Marcela\nended by scorning and rejecting him so as to bring the tragedy of his\nwretched life to a close; here, in memory of misfortunes so great, he\ndesired to be laid in the bowels of eternal oblivion.\" Then turning to\nDon Quixote and the travellers he went on to say, \"That body, sirs, on\nwhich you are looking with compassionate eyes, was the abode of a soul\non which Heaven bestowed a vast share of its riches. That is the body\nof Chrysostom, who was unrivalled in wit, unequalled in courtesy,\nunapproached in gentle bearing, a ph\u0153nix in friendship, generous\nwithout limit, grave without arrogance, gay without vulgarity, and, in\nshort, first in all that constitutes goodness and second to none in all\nthat makes up misfortune. He loved deeply, he was hated; he adored, he\nwas scorned; he wooed a wild beast, he pleaded with marble, he pursued\nthe wind, he cried to the wilderness, he served ingratitude, and for\nreward was made the prey of death in the mid-course of life, cut short\nby a shepherdess whom he sought to immortalise in the memory of man, as\nthese papers which you see could fully prove, had he not commanded me\nto consign them to the fire after having consigned his body to the\nearth.\"\n\"You would deal with them more harshly and cruelly than their owner\nhimself,\" said Vivaldo, \"for it is neither right nor proper to do the\nwill of one who enjoins what is wholly unreasonable; it would not have\nbeen reasonable in Augustus C\u00e6sar had he permitted the directions left\nby the divine Mantuan in his will to be carried into effect. So that,\nSe\u00f1or Ambrosio while you consign your friend's body to the earth, you\nshould not consign his writings to oblivion, for if he gave the order\nin bitterness of heart, it is not right that you should irrationally\nobey it. On the contrary, by granting life to those papers, let the\ncruelty of Marcela live for ever, to serve as a warning in ages to come\nto all men to shun and avoid falling into like danger; or I and all of\nus who have come here know already the story of this your love-stricken\nand heart-broken friend, and we know, too, your friendship, and the\ncause of his death, and the directions he gave at the close of his\nlife; from which sad story may be gathered how great was the cruelty of\nMarcela, the love of Chrysostom, and the loyalty of your friendship,\ntogether with the end awaiting those who pursue rashly the path that\ninsane passion opens to their eyes. Last night we learned the death of\nChrysostom and that he was to be buried here, and out of curiosity and\npity we left our direct road and resolved to come and see with our eyes\nthat which when heard of had so moved our compassion, and in\nconsideration of that compassion and our desire to prove it if we might\nby condolence, we beg of you, excellent Ambrosio, or at least I on my\nown account entreat you, that instead of burning those papers you allow\nme to carry away some of them.\"\nAnd without waiting for the shepherd's answer, he stretched out his\nhand and took up some of those that were nearest to him; seeing which\nAmbrosio said, \"Out of courtesy, se\u00f1or, I will grant your request as to\nthose you have taken, but it is idle to expect me to abstain from\nburning the remainder.\"",

      "text": "The \"Lay of Chrysostom\" met with the approbation of the listeners,\nthough the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had\nheard of Marcela's reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in\nit of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the\ngood name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who\nknew well his friend's most secret thoughts, \"Se\u00f1or, to remove that\ndoubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was\naway from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to\ntry if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everything\ndistresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginary\njealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormented\nChrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of\nMarcela remains unshaken, and with her envy itself should not and\ncannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, and\nvery scornful.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper\nof those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous\nvision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their\neyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave\nthere appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty\nexceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazed\nupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see\nher were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But\nthe instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest\nindignation:\n\"Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if\nin thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being\nthy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work\nof thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to\nlook down from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in\nthy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful\ndaughter trampled on her father Tarquin's? Tell us quickly for what\nthou art come, or what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the\nthoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will make\nall these who call themselves his friends obey thee, though he be\ndead.\"\n\"I come not, Ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named,\" replied\nMarcela, \"but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all\nthose who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom's death; and\ntherefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for\nit will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to\npersons of sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so\nmuch so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and\nfor the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to\nlove you. By that natural understanding which God has given me I know\nthat everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by\nreason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound to\nlove that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of that\nwhich is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is\nvery absurd to say, \"I love thee because thou art beautiful, thou must\nlove me though I be ugly.\" But supposing the beauty equal on both\nsides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore\nalike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasing\nthe eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty\nexcited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and\nfro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of\nbeautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true\nlove, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and\nnot compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire\nme to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you\nlove me? Nay\u2014tell me\u2014had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me\nbeautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?\nMoreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of\nmine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without\nmy asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it,\ndoes not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a\ngift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for\nbeauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword;\nthe one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come\ntoo near. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without\nwhich the body, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful;\nbut if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and\ncharm to mind and body, why should she who is loved for her beauty part\nwith it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his\nmight and energy to rob her of it? I was born free, and that I might\nlive in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of the\nmountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are my\nmirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and\ncharms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I have\ninspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived,\nand if their longings live on hope\u2014and I have given none to Chrysostom\nor to any other\u2014it cannot justly be said that the death of any is my\ndoing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed\nhim; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes were\nhonourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answer\nthat when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared to\nme his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetual\nsolitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my\nretirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal,\nhe chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what\nwonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I\nhad encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should\nhave acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was\npersistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated.\nBethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid\nto my charge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give way\nto despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatter\nhimself whom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; but\nlet not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon\nwhom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It has\nnot been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and to\nexpect me to love by choice is idle. Let this general declaration serve\nfor each of my suitors on his own account, and let it be understood\nfrom this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy\nor misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give no cause for\njealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn. Let\nhim who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as something\nnoxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold his\nservice; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls me\ncruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, this\nungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve,\nknow, or follow them. If Chrysostom's impatience and violent passion\nkilled him, why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be\nblamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should\nhe who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? I\nhave, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; my\ntaste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neither\nlove nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or\ntrifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of the\nshepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my\nrecreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains, and if they\never wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps\nby which the soul travels to its primeval abode.\"\nWith these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and",

The\nYanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were\nso many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into\nthe middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at\nthe second blow they brought Sancho to the ground, and Don Quixote\nfared the same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing,\nand fate willed it that he should fall at the feet of Rocinante, who\nhad not yet risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can\npound in angry boorish hands.",

      "text": "Then, seeing the mischief they had done, the Yanguesans with all the\nhaste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving\nthe two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.\nSancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his\nmaster he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, \"Se\u00f1or Don\nQuixote, ah, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote!\"\n\"What wouldst thou, brother Sancho?\" answered Don Quixote in the same\nfeeble suffering tone as Sancho.\n\"I would like, if it were possible,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"your\nworship to give me a couple of sups of that potion of the fiery Blas,\nif it be that you have any to hand there; perhaps it will serve for\nbroken bones as well as for wounds.\"\n\"If I only had it here, wretch that I am, what more should we want?\"\nsaid Don Quixote; \"but I swear to thee, Sancho Panza, on the faith of a\nknight-errant, ere two days are over, unless fortune orders otherwise,\nI mean to have it in my possession, or my hand will have lost its\ncunning.\"\n\"But in how many does your worship think we shall have the use of our\nfeet?\" answered Sancho Panza.\n\"For myself I must say I cannot guess how many,\" said the battered\nknight Don Quixote; \"but I take all the blame upon myself, for I had no\nbusiness to put hand to sword against men who where not dubbed knights\nlike myself, and so I believe that in punishment for having\ntransgressed the laws of chivalry the God of battles has permitted this\nchastisement to be administered to me; for which reason, brother\nSancho, it is well thou shouldst receive a hint on the matter which I\nam now about to mention to thee, for it is of much importance to the\nwelfare of both of us. It is that when thou shalt see rabble of this\nsort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against\nthem, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise\nthem to thy heart's content, and if any knights come to their aid and\ndefence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my\nmight; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what\nthe might of this strong arm of mine is equal to\"\u2014so uplifted had the\npoor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.\nBut Sancho did not so fully approve of his master's admonition as to\nlet it pass without saying in reply, \"Se\u00f1or, I am a man of peace, meek\nand quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and\nchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your\nworship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw\nsword either against clown or against knight, and that here before God\nI forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have\nbeen, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble\nor commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.\"\nTo all which his master said in reply, \"I wish I had breath enough to\nspeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would\nabate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest.\nCome now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse,\nshould turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that\nsafely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those\nislands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning\nit I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible\nthrough not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor\npossessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy\nlordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and\nprovinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well\ndisposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some\nmove to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance may\ndo for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good\nsense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself,\nwhatever may befall him.\"\n\"In what has now befallen us,\" answered Sancho, \"I'd have been well\npleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,\nbut I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than\nfor arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help\nRocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of\nall this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to\nbe a virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right\nthat it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is\nnothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty\nslashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was\ncoming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a great\nstorm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?\"\n\"And yet thine, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"ought to be used to such\nsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain\nthey must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not\nthat I imagine\u2014why do I say imagine?\u2014know of a certainty that all these\nannoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I\nwould lay me down here to die of pure vexation.\"\nTo this the squire replied, \"Se\u00f1or, as these mishaps are what one reaps\nof chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their\nown fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after\ntwo harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his\ninfinite mercy helps us.\"\n\"Know, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that the life of\nknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and\nneither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for\nknights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in\nthe case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly\nacquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of\nsome who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have\nmentioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers\nmisfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself\nin the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is\npositively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than two\nhundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the\npillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of\nno small authority who says that the Knight of Ph\u0153bus, being caught in\na certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on\nfalling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground,\nwhere they administered to him one of those things they call clysters,\nof sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had not\nbeen succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his,\nit would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well suffer\nin company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities\nwhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have\nthee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen\nby chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in\nthe law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler\nstrikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in\nfact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he\nstruck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst\nimagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have\ntherefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with\nwhich they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one\nof them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\"\n\"They gave me no time to see that much,\" answered Sancho, \"for hardly\nhad I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders\nwith their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes\nand the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and\nwhere thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or\nnot gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they\nwill remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\"\n\"For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\" said Don Quixote, \"that\nthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain\nwhich death does not remove.\"\n\"And what greater misfortune can there be,\" replied Panza, \"than the\none that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If\nour mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters,\nit would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the\nplasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to put us right.\"\n\"No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to\ndo,\" returned Don Quixote, \"and let us see how Rocinante is, for it\nseems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the\nlot of the poor beast.\"\n\"There is nothing wonderful in that,\" replied Sancho, \"since he is a\nknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come\noff scot-free where we come out scotched.\"\n\"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring\nrelief to it,\" said Don Quixote; \"I say so because this little beast\nmay now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle\nwhere I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any\ndishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old\nSilenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he\nentered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on\na handsome ass.\"\n\"It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,\" answered\nSancho, \"but there is a great difference between going mounted and\ngoing slung like a sack of manure.\"\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Wounds received in battle confer honour\ninstead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I\ntold thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy\nbeast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere\nnight come on and surprise us in these wilds.\"",

      "text": "The innkeeper, seeing Don Quixote slung across the ass, asked Sancho\nwhat was amiss with him. Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that\nhe had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The\ninnkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her\ncalling commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for\nthe sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don\nQuixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in\ntaking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, an\nAsturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one\neye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be\nsure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from\nhead to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made\nher contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass,\nthen, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don\nQuixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served\nfor many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a\ncarrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,\nthough only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much\nthe advantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough\nboards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness\nmight have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they not\nseen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed\npebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet\nthe threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without\nmissing one in the reckoning.\nOn this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and\nher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while\nMaritornes\u2014for that was the name of the Asturian\u2014held the light for\nthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of\nwheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the\nlook of blows than of a fall.\nIt was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and\nprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. \"Pray, se\u00f1ora,\"\nhe added, \"manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone\nto use it, for my loins too are rather sore.\"\n\"Then you must have fallen too,\" said the hostess.\n\"I did not fall,\" said Sancho Panza, \"but from the shock I got at\nseeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a\nthousand thwacks.\"\n\"That may well be,\" said the young girl, \"for it has many a time\nhappened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never\ncoming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as\nweak and shaken as if I had really fallen.\"\n\"There is the point, se\u00f1ora,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"that I without\ndreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with\nscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\"\n\"How is the gentleman called?\" asked Maritornes the Asturian.\n\"Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"and he is a\nknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen\nin the world this long time past.\"\n\"What is a knight-adventurer?\" said the lass.\n\"Are you so new in the world as not to know?\" answered Sancho Panza.\n\"Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing\nthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most\nmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or\nthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.\"\n\"Then how is it,\" said the hostess, \"that belonging to so good a master\nas this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a\ncounty?\"\n\"It is too soon yet,\" answered Sancho, \"for we have only been a month\ngoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that\ncan be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for\nanother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of\nthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not\nchange my hopes for the best title in Spain.\"\nTo all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively,\nand sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by\nthe hand he said to her, \"Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself\nfortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which\nis such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is\ncommonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you\nwho I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on\nmy memory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my\ngratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me\nnot so enthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair\ningrate whom I name between my teeth, but that those of this lovely\ndamsel might be the masters of my liberty.\"\nThe hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in\nbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood\nabout as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they\ncould perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and\nblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they\nstared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man\nof a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in\npothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave\nher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.",

What I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her\nlively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe\nto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in\nsilence! I will only tell thee that, either fate being envious of so\ngreat a boon placed in my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this\nis more probable) this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted,\nat the time when I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorous\ndiscourse with her, there came, without my seeing or knowing whence it\ncame, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted such\na cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and then\npummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterday\nwhen the carriers, on account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, inflicted on\nus the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must be\nsome enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel's beauty, and\nthat it is not for me.\"\n\"Not for me either,\" said Sancho, \"for more than four hundred Moors\nhave so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and\nfancy-bread to it. But tell me, se\u00f1or, what do you call this excellent\nand rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your\nworship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable\nbeauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks\nI think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me!\nfor I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the\nmishaps, the greater part falls to my share.\"\n\"Then thou hast been thrashed too?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!\" said Sancho.\n\"Be not distressed, friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will now make the\nprecious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of\nan eye.\"\nBy this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and\ncame in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho\ncaught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a\ncloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding\ncountenance, he said to his master, \"Se\u00f1or, can it be that this is the\nenchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there be\nanything still left in the ink-bottle?\"\n\"It cannot be the Moor,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for those under\nenchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.\"\n\"If they don't let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,\"\nsaid Sancho; \"if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.\"\n\"Mine could speak too,\" said Don Quixote, \"but that is not a sufficient\nreason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.\"\nThe officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful\nconversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay\non his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The\nofficer turned to him and said, \"Well, how goes it, good man?\"\n\"I would speak more politely if I were you,\" replied Don Quixote; \"is\nit the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, you\nbooby?\"\nThe cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a\nsorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of\noil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him\na badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and\nSancho Panza said, \"That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Se\u00f1or, and he\nkeeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and\nlamp-whacks.\"\n\"That is the truth,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and there is no use in\ntroubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or\nvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no\none on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou\ncanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a\nlittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam,\nfor indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing\nmuch blood from the wound that phantom gave me.\"\nSancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the\ninnkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see\nwhat had become of his enemy, he said to him, \"Se\u00f1or, whoever you are,\ndo us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt,\nand wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on\nearth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted\nMoor that is in this inn.\"\nWhen the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out\nof his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn\ngate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The\nhost furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don\nQuixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the\nblow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple\nof rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat\nthat flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be\nbrief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them\nall and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come\nto perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as\nthere was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin\noil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and over\nthe flask he repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more\nave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by\nway of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the\ninnkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully\nengaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.\nThis being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the\nspot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and\nso he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and\nremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had\nhe done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was\nleft in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke\ninto a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and\nleave him alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three\nhours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief\nand so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured,\nand verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that\nwith this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear, face any\nkind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.\nSancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as\nmiraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which\nwas no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with\nboth hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and\ndrained off very little less than his master. But the fact is, that the\nstomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his\nmaster, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and\nretchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he\nbelieved his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked and\ntormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.\nDon Quixote seeing him in this state said, \"It is my belief, Sancho,\nthat this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am\npersuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.\"\n\"If your worship knew that,\" returned Sancho\u2014\"woe betide me and all my\nkindred!\u2014why did you let me taste it?\"\nAt this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to\ndischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had\nthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for\nnothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and\nconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end\nhad come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the\nend of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and\nexhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has\nbeen said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his\ndeparture at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all\nthe time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in it\nwho stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he had\nthe security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by\nthis impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on\nhis squire's beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass;\nafter which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he\nlaid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance.\nAll that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood\nwatching him; the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him, and\nhe too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a\nsigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they\nall thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate\nthey who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.\nAs soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to\nthe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, \"Many and great\nare the favours, Se\u00f1or Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of\nyours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you\nfor them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you\nof any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is\nno other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to\nchastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this\nkind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of\nknighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and\nreparation to the utmost of your desire.\"\nThe innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, \"Sir Knight, I do not\nwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done\nme I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is\nthat you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night,\nas well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and\nbeds.\"\nc16c.jpg (326K)\nFull Size\n\"Then this is an inn?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"And a very respectable one,\" said the innkeeper.\n\"I have been under a mistake all this time,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for\nin truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it\nappears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is\nthat you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of\nknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have\nread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or\nanything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that\nmight be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the\ninsufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by\nday, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and\nthirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and\nall the hardships of earth.\"\n\"I have little to do with that,\" replied the innkeeper; \"pay me what\nyou owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care\nabout is to get my money.\"\n\"You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\" said Don Quixote, and putting\nspurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of\nthe inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance\nwithout looking to see if his squire was following him.\nThe innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment\nof Sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,\nbecause, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and\nreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying",

Wheeling about he\ncame up to the inn with a laborious gallop, and finding it shut went\nround it to see if he could find some way of getting in; but as soon as\nhe came to the wall of the yard, which was not very high, he discovered\nthe game that was being played with his squire. He saw him rising and\nfalling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that, had his rage\nallowed him, it is my belief he would have laughed. He tried to climb\nfrom his horse on to the top of the wall, but he was so bruised and\nbattered that he could not even dismount; and so from the back of his\nhorse he began to utter such maledictions and objurgations against\nthose who were blanketing Sancho as it would be impossible to write\ndown accurately: they, however, did not stay their laughter or their\nwork for this, nor did the flying Sancho cease his lamentations,\nmingled now with threats, now with entreaties but all to little\npurpose, or none at all, until from pure weariness they left off. They\nthen brought him his ass, and mounting him on top of it they put his\njacket round him; and the compassionate Maritornes, seeing him so\nexhausted, thought fit to refresh him with a jug of water, and that it\nmight be all the cooler she fetched it from the well. Sancho took it,\nand as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of\nhis master exclaiming, \"Sancho, my son, drink not water; drink it not,\nmy son, for it will kill thee; see, here I have the blessed balsam (and\nhe held up the flask of liquor), and with drinking two drops of it thou\nwilt certainly be restored.\"\nAt these words Sancho turned his eyes asquint, and in a still louder\nvoice said, \"Can it be your worship has forgotten that I am not a\nknight, or do you want me to end by vomiting up what bowels I have left\nafter last night? Keep your liquor in the name of all the devils, and\nleave me to myself!\" and at one and the same instant he left off\ntalking and began drinking; but as at the first sup he perceived it was\nwater he did not care to go on with it, and begged Maritornes to fetch\nhim some wine, which she did with right good will, and paid for it with\nher own money; for indeed they say of her that, though she was in that\nline of life, there was some faint and distant resemblance to a\nChristian about her. When Sancho had done drinking he dug his heels\ninto his ass, and the gate of the inn being thrown open he passed out\nvery well pleased at having paid nothing and carried his point, though\nit had been at the expense of his usual sureties, his shoulders. It is\ntrue that the innkeeper detained his alforjas in payment of what was\nowing to him, but Sancho took his departure in such a flurry that he\nnever missed them. The innkeeper, as soon as he saw him off, wanted to\nbar the gate close, but the blanketers would not agree to it, for they\nwere fellows who would not have cared two farthings for Don Quixote,\neven had he been really one of the knights-errant of the Round Table.",

But go not just yet, for I want thy\nhelp and assistance; come hither, and see how many of my teeth and\ngrinders are missing, for I feel as if there was not one left in my\nmouth.\"\nSancho came so close that he almost put his eyes into his mouth; now\njust at that moment the balsam had acted on the stomach of Don Quixote,\nso, at the very instant when Sancho came to examine his mouth, he\ndischarged all its contents with more force than a musket, and full\ninto the beard of the compassionate squire.\n\"Holy Mary!\" cried Sancho, \"what is this that has happened me? Clearly\nthis sinner is mortally wounded, as he vomits blood from the mouth;\"\nbut considering the matter a little more closely he perceived by the\ncolour, taste, and smell, that it was not blood but the balsam from the\nflask which he had seen him drink; and he was taken with such a\nloathing that his stomach turned, and he vomited up his inside over his\nvery master, and both were left in a precious state. Sancho ran to his\nass to get something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his\nmaster, out of his alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took\nleave of his senses, and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved\nto quit his master and return home, even though he forfeited the wages\nof his service and all hopes of the promised island.",

Seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, Don Quixote\nsaid to him:\n\"Bear in mind, Sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he\ndoes more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs\nthat fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with\nus, for it is impossible for good or evil to last for ever; and hence\nit follows that the evil having lasted long, the good must be now nigh\nat hand; so thou must not distress thyself at the misfortunes which\nhappen to me, since thou hast no share in them.\"\n\"How have I not?\" replied Sancho; \"was he whom they blanketed yesterday\nperchance any other than my father's son? and the alforjas that are\nmissing to-day with all my treasures, did they belong to any other but\nmyself?\"\n\"What! are the alforjas missing, Sancho?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Yes, they are missing,\" answered Sancho.\n\"In that case we have nothing to eat to-day,\" replied Don Quixote.\n\"It would be so,\" answered Sancho, \"if there were none of the herbs\nyour worship says you know in these meadows, those with which\nknights-errant as unlucky as your worship are wont to supply such-like\nshortcomings.\"\n\"For all that,\" answered Don Quixote, \"I would rather have just now a\nquarter of bread, or a loaf and a couple of pilchards' heads, than all\nthe herbs described by Dioscorides, even with Doctor Laguna's notes.\nNevertheless, Sancho the Good, mount thy beast and come along with me,\nfor God, who provides for all things, will not fail us (more especially\nwhen we are so active in his service as we are), since he fails not the\nmidges of the air, nor the grubs of the earth, nor the tadpoles of the\nwater, and is so merciful that he maketh his sun to rise on the good\nand on the evil, and sendeth rain on the unjust and on the just.\"\n\"Your worship would make a better preacher than knight-errant,\" said\nSancho.\n\"Knights-errant knew and ought to know everything, Sancho,\" said Don\nQuixote; \"for there were knights-errant in former times as well\nqualified to deliver a sermon or discourse in the middle of an\nencampment, as if they had graduated in the University of Paris;\nwhereby we may see that the lance has never blunted the pen, nor the\npen the lance.\"\n\"Well, be it as your worship says,\" replied Sancho; \"let us be off now\nand find some place of shelter for the night, and God grant it may be\nsomewhere where there are no blankets, nor blanketeers, nor phantoms,\nnor enchanted Moors; for if there are, may the devil take the whole\nconcern.\"\n\"Ask that of God, my son,\" said Don Quixote; and do thou lead on where\nthou wilt, for this time I leave our lodging to thy choice; but reach\nme here thy hand, and feel with thy finger, and find out how many of my\nteeth and grinders are missing from this right side of the upper jaw,\nfor it is there I feel the pain.\"\nSancho put in his fingers, and feeling about asked him, \"How many\ngrinders used your worship have on this side?\"\n\"Four,\" replied Don Quixote, \"besides the back-tooth, all whole and\nquite sound.\"\n\"Mind what you are saying, se\u00f1or.\"\n\"I say four, if not five,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for never in my life\nhave I had tooth or grinder drawn, nor has any fallen out or been\ndestroyed by any decay or rheum.\"\n\"Well, then,\" said Sancho, \"in this lower side your worship has no more\nthan two grinders and a half, and in the upper neither a half nor any\nat all, for it is all as smooth as the palm of my hand.\"\n\"Luckless that I am!\" said Don Quixote, hearing the sad news his squire\ngave him; \"I had rather they despoiled me of an arm, so it were not the\nsword-arm; for I tell thee, Sancho, a mouth without teeth is like a\nmill without a millstone, and a tooth is much more to be prized than a\ndiamond; but we who profess the austere order of chivalry are liable to\nall this. Mount, friend, and lead the way, and I will follow thee at\nwhatever pace thou wilt.\"\nSancho did as he bade him, and proceeded in the direction in which he\nthought he might find refuge without quitting the high road, which was\nthere very much frequented. As they went along, then, at a slow\npace\u2014for the pain in Don Quixote's jaws kept him uneasy and\nill-disposed for speed\u2014Sancho thought it well to amuse and divert him\nby talk of some kind, and among the things he said to him was that\nwhich will be told in the following chapter.",

And as the\nencamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive\ntone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary\nplace was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and even\ninto his master's; and (save in Don Quixote's case) did so, for all\nSancho's resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite with\nhis master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him\nvividly as one of the adventures of his books.\nHe took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne\nsome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved\nfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in\nrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and\nbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the\nencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at\nhand he raised his voice and said:\n\"Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye\nare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,\nfor, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some\nwrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I\nshould know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done,\nor else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted\nupon you.\"\n\"We are in haste,\" answered one of the encamisados, \"and the inn is far\noff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;\"\nand spurring his mule he moved on.\nDon Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule\nby the bridle he said, \"Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an\naccount of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,\nall of you.\"\nThe mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that\nrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An\nattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse\nDon Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his\nlance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly\nwounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the\nagility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for\nit seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so\nlightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid\nfolk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and\nset off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, looking\nexactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. The\nmourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were\nunable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don\nQuixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, for\nthey all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away\nthe dead body they had in the litter.",

The ass is in proper trim, the\nmountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do\nbut make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave\nand the living to the loaf.\"\nAnd driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,\nfeeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after\nproceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves\nin a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded\nhis beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,\nthey breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying\ntheir appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead\nman's clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)\nhad brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of\nill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was\nthat they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips;\nand as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where\nthey were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in\nthe following chapter.",

Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the\ngloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of\nthose trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came,\nthat seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down from\nthe lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering that\nwounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itself\nare enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars\nhimself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the\nkind. Well, then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentive\nand stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom through\neagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be;\ntherefore tighten Rocinante's girths a little, and God be with thee;\nwait for me here three days and no more, and if in that time I come not\nback, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favour\nand a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to my\nincomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath died in\nattempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers.\"\nWhen Sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the most\npathetic way, saying:\n\"Se\u00f1or, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful\nadventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn\nabout and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink for\nthree days to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will\nthere be anyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time\nheard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preach\nthat he who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt\nGod by trying so tremendous a feat from which there can be no escape\nsave by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for your\nworship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringing\nyou out victorious and safe and sound from among all those enemies that\nwere with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften that\nhard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will have\nhardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my soul up\nto anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to come\nand serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but as\ncovetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just as\nI had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island your\nworship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of it\nyou mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God's\nsake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship will\nnot entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off till\nmorning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells me\nit cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Horn\nis overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.\"\n\"How canst thou see, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where it makes that\nline, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when\nthe night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole\nheaven?\"\n\"That's true,\" said Sancho, \"but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things\nunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason\nto show that it now wants but little of day.\"\n\"Let it want what it may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"it shall not be said\nof me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from\ndoing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee,\nSancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to\nundertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care\nto watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is\nto tighten Rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for I shall come\nback shortly, alive or dead.\"",

Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do\nas thou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my\ncharacter.\"\n\"Be not angry, master mine,\" replied Sancho, \"I did not mean to say\nthat;\" and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the\nsaddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master's left\nthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him;\nso much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a\nregular beat. Don Quixote bade him tell some story to amuse him as he\nhad proposed, to which Sancho replied that he would if his dread of\nwhat he heard would let him; \"Still,\" said he, \"I will strive to tell a\nstory which, if I can manage to relate it, and nobody interferes with\nthe telling, is the best of stories, and let your worship give me your\nattention, for here I begin. What was, was; and may the good that is to\ncome be for all, and the evil for him who goes to look for it\u2014your\nworship must know that the beginning the old folk used to put to their\ntales was not just as each one pleased; it was a maxim of Cato\nZonzorino the Roman, that says 'the evil for him that goes to look for\nit,' and it comes as pat to the purpose now as ring to finger, to show\nthat your worship should keep quiet and not go looking for evil in any\nquarter, and that we should go back by some other road, since nobody\nforces us to follow this in which so many terrors affright us.\"",

      "text": "When Don Quixote perceived what it was, he was struck dumb and rigid\nfrom head to foot. Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent\ndown upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced\nat Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of\nlaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his\nvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when\nSancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold\nhis sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.\nFour times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out\nafresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew\nfurious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, \"Thou must know,\nfriend Sancho, that of Heaven's will I was born in this our iron age to\nrevive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved\nperils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;\" and here he went on\nrepeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard\nthe awful strokes.\nDon Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule,\nwas so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two\nsuch blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had\ncaught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless\nindeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward\nreturn in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it\nstill further, said to him very humbly, \"Calm yourself, sir, for by God\nI am only joking.\"\n\"Well, then, if you are joking I am not,\" replied Don Quixote. \"Look\nhere, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,\nhad been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the\ncourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance,\nbeing, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and\ntell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when\nperhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have,\nlow boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But turn\nme these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one\nby one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels,\nthen make what mockery you like of me.\"\n\"No more of that, se\u00f1or,\" returned Sancho; \"I own I went a little too\nfar with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made\nbetween us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may\nbefall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one),\nwas it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great\nfear we were in?\u2014at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see\nnow that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay\nis.\"\n\"I do not deny,\" said Don Quixote, \"that what happened to us may be\nworth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is\nnot everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.\"\n\"At any rate,\" said Sancho, \"your worship knew how to hit the right\npoint with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the\nshoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let\nthat pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say 'he\nloves thee well that makes thee weep;' and moreover that it is the way\nwith great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him a\npair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows,\nunless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms\non the mainland.\"\n\"It may be on the dice,\" said Don Quixote, \"that all thou sayest will\ncome true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that\nour first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the\nfuture bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my\ncompany; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they\nare innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his\nlord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault\nof thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for\nme; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There was\nGandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula\nFirme, and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with his\ncap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, more\nturquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire of\nGalaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatness\nof his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the\nwhole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have said\nthou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference between\nmaster and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so\nthat from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more\nrespect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provoked\nwith you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits that\nI have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not your\nwages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.\"\n\"All that your worship says is very well,\" said Sancho, \"but I should\nlike to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might\nbe necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a\nknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by\nthe day like bricklayers?\"\n\"I do not believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that such squires were ever\non wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned\nthine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to\nwhat may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in\nthese wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for\ntrifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in\nthis there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Sancho, \"since the mere noise of the hammers of a\nfulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant\nerrant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open\nmy lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship's, but\nonly to honour you as my master and natural lord.\"\n\"By so doing,\" replied Don Quixote, \"shalt thou live long on the face\nof the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as\nthough they were parents.\"\nc19e.jpg (33K)",

In that neighbourhood there were two\nvillages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop\nnor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of\nthe larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who\nrequired to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on\nthis errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but\nas luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not\nto spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on his\nhead, and being clean it glittered at half a league's distance. He rode\nupon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to Don\nQuixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for\neverything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and\nill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, without\nentering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top speed he bore\ndown upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him\nthrough and through, and as he reached him, without checking the fury\nof his charge, he cried to him:\n\"Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that\nwhich is so reasonably my due.\"\nThe barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this\napparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself\nfrom the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and\nno sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than\na deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.\nHe left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented\nhimself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated\nthe beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts\noff with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it\nis pursued.",

Forth all ye,\nthe knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh\nhither!' At which command all will issue forth, and he himself,\nadvancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and\nsalute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the\nqueen's chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her\ndaughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished\ndamsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the\nknown world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her\neyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the\nother something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why\nthey will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and\nsorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their\npains and sufferings known by speech.

There is another thing, too, that is\nwanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful\ndaughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe,\nI know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or even\nsecond cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give\nme his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on\nthis point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by\nthis deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. True\nit is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and\nentitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be that the sage\nwho shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree\nthat I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for I\nwould have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in\nthe world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings\nand princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a\npoint like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common\nherd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords;\nso that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are,\nand the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such\nthat after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with\nwhich the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied;\nand should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she\nwell knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her\nlord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to\nseizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will\nput an end to the wrath of her parents.\"\n\"It comes to this, too,\" said Sancho, \"what some naughty people say,\n'Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;' though it would\nfit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.'\nI say so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law,\nwill not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing\nfor it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But\nthe mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful\nenjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as\nrewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his\nwife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad\nluck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose,\nmay as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.\"\n\"Nobody can object to that,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Then since that may be,\" said Sancho, \"there is nothing for it but to\ncommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.\"\n\"God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"and mean be he who thinks himself mean.\"\n\"In God's name let him be so,\" said Sancho: \"I am an old Christian, and\nto fit me for a count that's enough.\"\n\"And more than enough for thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and even wert thou\nnot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily\ngive thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for\nwhen I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they\nmay say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee\n'your lordship,' whether they like it or not.\"\n\"Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle,\" said\nSancho.\n\"Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,\" said his master.\n\"So be it,\" answered Sancho. \"I say I will know how to behave, for once\nin my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so\nwell on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same\nbrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my\nback, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe\nthey'll come a hundred leagues to see me.\"\n\"Thou wilt look well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must shave thy beard\noften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou\ndost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou\nart at the distance of a musket shot.\"\n\"What more will it be,\" said Sancho, \"than having a barber, and keeping\nhim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him\ngo behind me like a nobleman's equerry.\"\n\"Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?\"\nasked Don Quixote.\n\"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho. \"Years ago I was for a month at the\ncapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they\nsaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in\nevery turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man\ndid not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they\nanswered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with\nnobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it,\nfor I have never forgotten it.\"\n\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in the same way thou mayest\ncarry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all\ntogether, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the\nfirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one's\nbeard is a greater trust than saddling one's horse.\"\n\"Let the barber business be my look-out,\" said Sancho; \"and your\nworship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.\"\n\"So it shall be,\" answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw",

With them there came also two men on horseback and two on foot;\nthose on horseback with wheel-lock muskets, those on foot with javelins\nand swords, and as soon as Sancho saw them he said:\n\"That is a chain of galley slaves, on the way to the galleys by force\nof the king's orders.\"\n\"How by force?\" asked Don Quixote; \"is it possible that the king uses\nforce against anyone?\"\n\"I do not say that,\" answered Sancho, \"but that these are people\ncondemned for their crimes to serve by force in the king's galleys.\"\n\"In fact,\" replied Don Quixote, \"however it may be, these people are\ngoing where they are taking them by force, and not of their own will.\"\n\"Just so,\" said Sancho.\n\"Then if so,\" said Don Quixote, \"here is a case for the exercise of my\noffice, to put down force and to succour and help the wretched.\"\n\"Recollect, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"Justice, which is the king\nhimself, is not using force or doing wrong to such persons, but\npunishing them for their crimes.\"\nThe chain of galley slaves had by this time come up, and Don Quixote in",

But God is great; patience\u2014there, that's\nenough of it.\"\nDon Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a\nwhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the\nreason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but\nthe fifth acted as his tongue and said, \"This worthy man is going to\nthe galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony\nand on horseback.\"\n\"That means,\" said Sancho Panza, \"as I take it, to have been exposed to\nshame in public.\"\n\"Just so,\" replied the galley slave, \"and the offence for which they\ngave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay\nbody-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and\nfor having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.\"\n\"If that touch had not been thrown in,\" said Don Quixote, \"he would not\ndeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command\nand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one,\nbeing the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a\nwell-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth;\nnay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other\noffices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this\nway many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office\nand calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as\nwomen more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and\nexperience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of\ncontrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their\nmouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to go\nfarther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those\nwho are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not\nthe fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to someone\nable to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additional\nfact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see\nthese white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a\nposition on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are\nno sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some\nsimple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm\nthat can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to\nturn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power\nto cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the\nwill.\"\n\"It is true,\" said the good old man, \"and indeed, sir, as far as the\ncharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I\ncannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my\nonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in\npeace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions\nwere unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back\nfrom, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that\nnever gives me a moment's ease;\" and again he fell to weeping as\nbefore, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a",

If\nyou, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it\nto you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to\nhim to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may be\nas long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves.\"\nThis one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he\nwas a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.\nBehind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,\nexcept that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the\nother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a\nchain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on\nhis neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a\n\"keep-friend\" or \"friend's foot,\" from which hung two irons reaching to\nhis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were\nsecured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to\nhis mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this\nman carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that\nit was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put\ntogether, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they\nmarched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in\ndread of his making his escape.\n\"What crimes can he have committed,\" said Don Quixote, \"if they have\nnot deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?\"\n\"He goes for ten years,\" replied the guard, \"which is the same thing as\ncivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the\nfamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\"\n\"Gently, se\u00f1or commissary,\" said the galley slave at this, \"let us have\nno fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my\nfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind\nhis own business, and he will be doing enough.\"\n\"Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\" replied\nthe commissary, \"if you don't want me to make you hold your tongue in\nspite of your teeth.\"\n\"It is easy to see,\" returned the galley slave, \"that man goes as God\npleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo\nde Parapilla or not.\"\n\"Don't they call you so, you liar?\" said the guard.\n\"They do,\" returned Gines, \"but I will make them give over calling me\nso, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you,\nsir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed\nyou, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about\nthe lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I\nam Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.\"\n\"He says true,\" said the commissary, \"for he has himself written his\nstory as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in\npawn for two hundred reals.\"\n\"And I mean to take it out of pawn,\" said Gines, \"though it were in for\ntwo hundred ducats.\"\n\"Is it so good?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"So good is it,\" replied Gines, \"that a fig for 'Lazarillo de Tormes,'\nand all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written\ncompared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts,\nand facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them.\"\n\"And how is the book entitled?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"The 'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,'\" replied the subject of it.\n\"And is it finished?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"How can it be finished,\" said the other, \"when my life is not yet\nfinished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when\nthey sent me to the galleys this last time.\"\n\"Then you have been there before?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years\nbefore now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are\nlike,\" replied Gines; \"and it is no great grievance to me to go back to\nthem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many\nthings left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than\nenough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for\nI have it by heart.\"\n\"You seem a clever fellow,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"And an unfortunate one,\" replied Gines, \"for misfortune always",

He wants us to let the king's prisoners go,\nas if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so!\nGo your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that\nyou've got on your head, and don't go looking for three feet on a cat.\"\n\"'Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,\" replied Don Quixote, and\nacting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him\ntime to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with\na lance-thrust; and lucky it was for him that it was the one that had\nthe musket. The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this\nunexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback\nseized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don\nQuixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it\nwould have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance\nbefore them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving\nto break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,\nthat the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking\nloose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing\nat all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to\nrelease Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the\nplain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,\ntook from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and\nlevelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one\nof the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape\nPasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley\nslaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the\naffair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the\nmatter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell\nwould at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to\nhis master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into\nhiding in the sierra that was close by.\n\"That is all very well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I know what must be\ndone now;\" and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now\nrunning riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected\nthem round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as\nfollows: \"To be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons\nof good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is\ningratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest\nproof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire,\nand it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have\ntaken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El\nToboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del\nToboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance,\nsends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to her in full\ndetail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to the\nrecovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where ye\nwill, and good fortune attend you.\"\nGines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, \"That which you, sir,\nour deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most\nimpossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along the\nroads, but only singly and separate, and each one his own way,\nendeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the\nHoly Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What\nyour worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and\ntribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity\nof ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship's\nintention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night\nas by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that\nwe are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take\nup our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now\nnight, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us\nis like asking pears of the elm tree.\"\n\"Then by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath),\n\"Don son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name\nis, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your\nlegs and the whole chain on your back.\"\nPasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly\nconvinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had\ncommitted such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in\nthis fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they\nbegan to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite\nunable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more\nheeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted\nhimself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the\nhailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield\nhimself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him\nfull on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground;\nand the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched the\nbasin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his\nshoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to\npieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his\narmour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves\nhad not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him in\nhis shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils\nof the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous about\nkeeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than about\nburdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves\nbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and\nDon Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with\ndrooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he\nthought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over;\nRocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought to\nthe ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the\nHoly Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by\nthe very persons for whom he had done so much.",

As he went along, then, occupied with these\nthoughts, he perceived on the summit of a height that rose before their\neyes a man who went springing from rock to rock and from tussock to\ntussock with marvellous agility. As well as he could make out he was\nunclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled hair, and bare legs and\nfeet, his thighs were covered by breeches apparently of tawny velvet\nbut so ragged that they showed his skin in several places.\nc23g.jpg (360K)\nFull Size\nHe was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he\npassed as has been described, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance\nobserved and noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt,\nhe was unable to follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness\nof Rocinante to make way over such rough ground, he being, moreover,\nslow-paced and sluggish by nature. Don Quixote at once came to the\nconclusion that this was the owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise,\nand made up his mind to go in search of him, even though he should have\nto wander a year in those mountains before he found him, and so he\ndirected Sancho to take a short cut over one side of the mountain,\nwhile he himself went by the other, and perhaps by this means they\nmight light upon this man who had passed so quickly out of their sight.\n\"I could not do that,\" said Sancho, \"for when I separate from your\nworship fear at once lays hold of me, and assails me with all sorts of\npanics and fancies; and let what I now say be a notice that from this\ntime forth I am not going to stir a finger's width from your presence.\"\n\"It shall be so,\" said he of the Rueful Countenance, \"and I am very\nglad that thou art willing to rely on my courage, which will never fail\nthee, even though the soul in thy body fail thee; so come on now behind\nme slowly as well as thou canst, and make lanterns of thine eyes; let\nus make the circuit of this ridge; perhaps we shall light upon this man\nthat we saw, who no doubt is no other than the owner of what we found.\"\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"Far better would it be not to look for\nhim, for, if we find him, and he happens to be the owner of the money,\nit is plain I must restore it; it would be better, therefore, that\nwithout taking this needless trouble, I should keep possession of it\nuntil in some other less meddlesome and officious way the real owner\nmay be discovered; and perhaps that will be when I shall have spent it,\nand then the king will hold me harmless.\"\n\"Thou art wrong there, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for now that we have\na suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are\nbound to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the\nstrong suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty\nas if he were so; and so, friend Sancho, let not our search for him\ngive thee any uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine.\"\nAnd so saying he gave Rocinante the spur, and Sancho followed him on\nfoot and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the\nmountain they found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs\nand pecked by jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still\nfurther strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner\nof the mule and the saddle-pad.\nc23h.jpg (381K)",

      "text": "As they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a\nshepherd watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared\na great number of goats and behind them on the summit of the mountain\nthe goatherd in charge of them, a man advanced in years. Don Quixote\ncalled aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He\nshouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or\nnever trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other\nwild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down,\nand they would explain all to him.\nThe goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood,\nhe said, \"I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead\nin the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six\nmonths; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?\"\n\"We have come upon nobody,\" answered Don Quixote, \"nor on anything\nexcept a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from\nthis.\"\n\"I found it too,\" said the goatherd, \"but I would not lift it nor go\nnear it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the\ndevil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall\nwithout knowing why or wherefore.\"\n\"That's exactly what I say,\" said Sancho; \"I found it too, and I would\nnot go within a stone's throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies\njust as it was, for I don't want a dog with a bell.\"\n\"Tell me, good man,\" said Don Quixote, \"do you know who is the owner of\nthis property?\"\n\"All I can tell you,\" said the goatherd, \"is that about six months ago,\nmore or less, there arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps,\naway from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on\nthat same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and\nvalise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part\nof this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was\nwhere we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a\nleague farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and\nI am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road\nor path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our\nanswer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to\nhim, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his\nquestion and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of\nthe sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days\nafterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without\nsaying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and\nkicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the\nbread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again\ninto the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds\nlearned this we went in search of him for about two days through the\nmost remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him\nlodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us\nwith great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so\ndisfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but\nthat his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we\nhad of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us\ncourteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at\nseeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in\norder that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been\nimposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never\nable to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of\nfood, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find\nhim, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or\nif this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and\nnot take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,\nbegged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask\nit in God's name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed\nabode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever\nnight might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping\nso bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we\nnot joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with\nwhat we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth,\nand in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good\nbirth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to\nhim, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it\nplain.\n\"But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,\nkeeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we\nstood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this\nabstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now\nstaring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving\nan eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising his\neyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind\nhad come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined was\nthe truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown\nhimself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and\nfierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten\nor bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, 'Oh faithless\nFernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast\ndone me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode and\ndwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to\nthese he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and\ncharging him with treachery and faithlessness.\n\"We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and\nwithout another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these\nbrakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;\nfrom this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and\nthat someone called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous\nnature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to\nshow. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, and\nthey have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time to\nbeg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at another\nto take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon\nhim, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it\nbut snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in his\nsenses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, and\nreceives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you the\ntruth, sirs,\" continued the goatherd, \"it was yesterday that we\nresolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the\nother two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him,\nand when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, to\nthe town of Almod\u00f3var, which is eight leagues from this, and there\nstrive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learn\nwhen he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we\nmay give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in\nanswer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the\narticles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and\nso naked.\"",

And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with\nany kind of courtesy, I entreat you, se\u00f1or, by that which I perceive\nyou possess in so high a degree, and likewise conjure you by whatever\nyou love or have loved best in life, to tell me who you are and the\ncause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a\nbrute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your\ncondition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear,\" added Don\nQuixote, \"by the order of knighthood which I have received, and by my\nvocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you with\nall the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving your\nmisfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as\nI promised to do.\"\nThe Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk\nin this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again,\nand again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly\nexamined him, he said to him:\n\"If you have anything to give me to eat, for God's sake give it me, and\nafter I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the\ngoodwill you have displayed towards me.\"",

In that same country\nthere was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could\ndesire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich\nas I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to so\nworthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored\nfrom my earliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all the\ninnocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents were aware of our\nfeelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly\nthat as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, a\nthing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families\nand wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us,\nso that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety's sake to\nrefuse me admission to his house, in this perhaps imitating the parents\nof that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but added\nlove to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon\nour tongues they could not impose it upon our pens, which can make\nknown the heart's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for\nmany a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will\nand strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many letters did I\nwrite her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! how many\nditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and\nmade known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in its\nrecollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient\nand feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to\nput into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of\nwinning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my\nlawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me for\nthe disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as\nhonoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was\nalive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in\naccordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be\ntaken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting\nthat there was reason in what he said, and that my father would assent",

      "text": "\"Peace, I say again, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for let me tell thee\nit is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into\nthese regions as that which I have of performing among them an\nachievement wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the\nknown world; and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal on\nall that can make a knight-errant perfect and famous.\"\n\"And is it very perilous, this achievement?\"\n\"No,\" replied he of the Rueful Countenance; \"though it may be in the\ndice that we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will depend\non thy diligence.\"\n\"On my diligence!\" said Sancho.\n\"Yes,\" said Don Quixote, \"for if thou dost return soon from the place\nwhere I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glory\nwill soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in\nsuspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee\nknow, Sancho, that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most\nperfect knights-errant\u2014I am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone,\nthe first, the only one, the lord of all that were in the world in his\ntime. A fig for Don Belianis, and for all who say he equalled him in\nany respect, for, my oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves! I\nsay, too, that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he\nendeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows;\nand the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and\ncallings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he who would be\nesteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person and\nlabours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience;\nas Virgil, too, shows us in the person of \u00c6neas the virtue of a pious\nson and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not representing\nor describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as to\nleave the example of their virtues to posterity. In the same way Amadis\nwas the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights, whom\nall we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to\nimitate. This, then, being so, I consider, friend Sancho, that the\nknight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to\nreaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in which\nthis knight most conspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour,\nendurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew, rejected by the\nLady Oriana, to do penance upon the Pe\u00f1a Pobre, changing his name into\nthat of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to\nthe life which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier for me\nto imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off\nserpents' heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets,\nand breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a\nsimilar purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now\nso conveniently offers me its forelock.\"",

They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving\nher in pledge a new cassock of the curate's; and the barber made a\nbeard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to\nstick his comb. The landlady asked them what they wanted these things\nfor, and the curate told her in a few words about the madness of Don\nQuixote, and how this disguise was intended to get him away from the\nmountain where he then was. The landlord and landlady immediately came\nto the conclusion that the madman was their guest, the balsam man and\nmaster of the blanketed squire, and they told the curate all that had\npassed between him and them, not omitting what Sancho had been so\nsilent about. Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a style\nthat left nothing to be desired; she put on him a cloth petticoat with\nblack velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green\nvelvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as the\npetticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba. The curate\nwould not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linen\ncap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip\nof black silk, while with another he made a mask with which he\nconcealed his beard and face very well. He then put on his hat, which\nwas broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himself\nin his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the barber\nmounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white,\nfor it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.\nThey took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she\nwas, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them\nsuccess in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had\nin hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck\nthe curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that\nfashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself\nthat way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the\nbarber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be\nthe distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire's part,\nwhich would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was\nresolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil\ntake Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the\npair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the\nbarber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their\nplan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what\nto say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and\ngive up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance. The\nbarber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction,\nand as he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where\nDon Quixote was, he folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted his\nbeard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who went",

He said, too, that it would be as well for him to\ngo on before them to find him, and give him his lady's answer; for that\nperhaps might be enough to bring him away from the place without\nputting them to all this trouble. They approved of what Sancho\nproposed, and resolved to wait for him until he brought back word of\nhaving found his master.\nSancho pushed on into the glens of the Sierra, leaving them in one\nthrough which there flowed a little gentle rivulet, and where the rocks\nand trees afforded a cool and grateful shade. It was an August day with\nall the heat of one, and the heat in those parts is intense, and the\nhour was three in the afternoon, all which made the spot the more\ninviting and tempted them to wait there for Sancho's return, which they\ndid.

He, showing no astonishment when he saw them, stood still\nwith his head bent down upon his breast like one in deep thought,\nwithout raising his eyes to look at them after the first glance when\nthey suddenly came upon him. The curate, who was aware of his\nmisfortune and recognised him by the description, being a man of good\naddress, approached him and in a few sensible words entreated and urged\nhim to quit a life of such misery, lest he should end it there, which\nwould be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio was then in his\nright mind, free from any attack of that madness which so frequently\ncarried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual among\nthe frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some surprise,\nespecially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a\nwell-known matter (for the curate's words gave him to understand as\nmuch) so he replied to them thus:\n\"I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is\nto succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this\nremote spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve\nit not, those who seek to draw me away from this to some better\nretreat, showing me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I\nact in leading the life I do; but as they know, that if I escape from\nthis evil I shall fall into another still greater, perhaps they will\nset me down as a weak-minded man, or, what is worse, one devoid of\nreason; nor would it be any wonder, for I myself can perceive that the\neffect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works so\npowerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become at times like a\nstone, without feeling or consciousness; and I come to feel the truth\nof it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I have done\nwhen the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot\nin vain, and idly curse my destiny, and plead for my madness by telling\nhow it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no reasonable\nbeings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they\ncannot help me at least they will not blame me, and the repugnance they\nfeel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes. If it be, sirs,\nthat you are here with the same design as others have come with, before\nyou proceed with your wise arguments, I entreat you to hear the story\nof my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard it you\nwill spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering\nconsolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.\"\nAs they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own\nlips the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it,\npromising not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not\nwish; and thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly",

      "text": "the same words and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote and\nthe goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and Don\nQuixote's scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale\nwas left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now\nfortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end;\nand so, coming to the incident of the note which Don Fernando had found\nin the volume of \"Amadis of Gaul,\" Cardenio said that he remembered it\nperfectly and that it was in these words:\n\"_Luscinda to Cardenio._\n\"Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold\nyou in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this\nobligation without cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a\nfather who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any\nconstraint on my inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you\nto have, if it be that you value me as you say and as I believe you\ndo.\"\n\"By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my\nwife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don\nFernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, and\nthis letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine\ncould be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda's\nfather was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I did\nnot dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;\nnot because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue,\nand beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honour\nto any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me\nto marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me.\nIn short, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as\nwell on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged\nme though I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to me\nthat what I desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando\nanswered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and\npersuade him to speak to Luscinda's father. O, ambitious Marius! O,\ncruel Catiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous\nVellido! O, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel,\nvindictive, and perfidious, wherein had this poor wretch failed in his\nfidelity, who with such frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys\nof his heart? What offence did I commit? What words did I utter, or\nwhat counsels did I give that had not the furtherance of thy honour and\nwelfare for their aim? But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? for\nsure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending from\non high they fall upon us with such fury and violence that no power on\nearth can check their course nor human device stay their coming. Who\ncould have thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman,\nintelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services, one that could\nwin the object of his love wherever he might set his affections, could\nhave become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my one ewe lamb\nthat was not even yet in my possession? But laying aside these useless\nand unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken thread of my\nunhappy story.\n\"To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the\nexecution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to\nhis elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for\nsix horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me\naway that he might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he had\npurchased the very day he offered to speak to my father, and the price\nof which he now desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this\ntreachery? Could I by any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from\nthat, I offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in my\nsatisfaction at the good bargain that had been made. That night I spoke\nwith Luscinda, and told her what had been agreed upon with Don\nFernando, and how I had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes\nbeing realised. She, as unsuspicious as I was of the treachery of Don\nFernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she believed the\nfulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father\nput off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this to\nme her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat that\nprevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me\nshe was striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn,\nwhich I never before observed in her, for we always conversed, whenever\ngood fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest\ngaiety and cheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or\nfears with our words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune\nthat Heaven should have given her to me for my mistress; I glorified\nher beauty, I extolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid me\nback by praising in me what in her love for me she thought worthy of\npraise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our\nneighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my\nboldness was to take, almost by force, one of her fair white hands and\ncarry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that\nseparated us allowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of my\ndeparture she wept, she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving me\nfilled with perplexity and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such\nstrange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to\ndash my hopes I ascribed it all to the depth of her love for me and the\npain that separation gives those who love tenderly. At last I took my\ndeparture, sad and dejected, my heart filled with fancies and\nsuspicions, but not knowing well what it was I suspected or fancied;\nplain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaiting\nme.\n\"I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don\nFernando's brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,\nfor he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in\nsome place where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his\nbrother wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all\nof which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brother\nhad no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once.\n\"The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying\nit, as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days\nseparated from Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful\nmood I have described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I\nobeyed, though I felt it would be at the cost of my well-being. But\nfour days later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which he\ngave me, and which by the address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as\nthe writing was hers. I opened it with fear and trepidation, persuaded\nthat it must be something serious that had impelled her to write to me\nwhen at a distance, as she seldom did so when I was near. Before\nreading it I asked the man who it was that had given it to him, and how\nlong he had been upon the road; he told me that as he happened to be\npassing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, a\nvery beautiful lady called to him from a window, and with tears in her\neyes said to him hurriedly, 'Brother, if you are, as you seem to be, a\nChristian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letter\ndespatched without a moment's delay to the place and person named in\nthe address, all which is well known, and by this you will render a\ngreat service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in\ndoing so take what is in this handkerchief;' and said he, 'with this\nshe threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which were tied up a\nhundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here together with the\nletter I have given you. And then without waiting for any answer she\nleft the window, though not before she saw me take the letter and the\nhandkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would do as she\nbade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I would\nhave in bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was to\nyou it was sent (for, se\u00f1or, I know you very well), and also unable to\nresist that beautiful lady's tears, I resolved to trust no one else,\nbut to come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen hours from the\ntime when it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know,\nis eighteen leagues.'\n\"All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this,\nI hung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I could\nscarcely stand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:\nThe promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine,\nhe has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your\nadvantage. I have to tell you, se\u00f1or, that he has demanded me for a\nwife, and my father, led away by what he considers Don Fernando's\nsuperiority over you, has favoured his suit so cordially, that in two\ndays hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so\nprivately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few\nof the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judge if it be\nurgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether I\nlove you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall\nbe forced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he\nhas pledged.\n\"Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set\nout at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now\nsaw clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own\npleasure that had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The\nexasperation I felt against Don Fernando, joined with the fear of\nlosing the prize I had won by so many years of love and devotion, lent\nme wings; so that almost flying I reached home the same day, by the\nhour which served for speaking with Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, and\nleft the mule on which I had come at the house of the worthy man who\nhad brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once so\nkind that I found Luscinda at the grating that was the witness of our\nloves. She recognised me at once, and I her, but not as she ought to\nhave recognised me, or I her. But who is there in the world that can\nboast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable\nnature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: as soon as Luscinda\nsaw me she said, 'Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and the\ntreacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me in\nthe hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of my\ndeath before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend,\nbut contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be\nprevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent\nmore deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a\nfirst proof of the love I have borne and bear thee.' I replied to her\ndistractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply,\n'May thy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a\ndagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to defend thee or kill myself\nif fortune be against us.'\n\"I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that\nthey called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now the\nnight of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my\neyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house,\nnor was I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was\nthat I should be present at what might take place on the occasion, I\nnerved myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the\nentrances and outlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret\npervaded the house no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I\nfound an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window\nof the hall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders of two\ntapestries, from between which I could, without being seen, see all\nthat took place in the room. Who could describe the agitation of heart\nI suffered as I stood there\u2014the thoughts that came to me\u2014the\nreflections that passed through my mind? They were such as cannot be,\nnor were it well they should be, told. Suffice it to say that the\nbridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress, without ornament of any\nkind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of Luscinda's and except\nthe servants of the house there was no one else in the chamber. Soon\nafterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber, attended by her\nmother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as became her rank\nand beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My anxiety and\ndistraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she\nwore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white,\nand the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and apparel,\nsurpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying with\nthe precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the\nhall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of my\npeace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored\nenemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and\nrecall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may\nseek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not\nweary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of\nthose that can or should be told tersely and briefly, for to me each\nincident seems to call for many words.\"\nTo this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of\nlistening to him, but that the details he mentioned interested them\ngreatly, being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the\nsame attention as the main story.\n\"To proceed, then,\" continued Cardenio: \"all being assembled in the\nhall, the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the\nhand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, 'Will you, Se\u00f1ora\nLuscinda, take Se\u00f1or Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful\nhusband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?' I thrust my head and neck\nout from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing\nheart set myself to listen to Luscinda's answer, awaiting in her reply\nthe sentence of death or the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at\nthat moment to rush forward crying aloud, 'Luscinda, Luscinda! have a\ncare what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art\nmine and canst not be another's; reflect that thy utterance of \"Yes\"\nand the end of my life will come at the same instant. O, treacherous\nDon Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou?\nRemember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thy\nwishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her husband!' Fool that I\nam! now that I am far away, and out of danger, I say I should have done\nwhat I did not do: now that I have allowed my precious treasure to be\nrobbed from me, I curse the robber, on whom I might have taken\nvengeance had I as much heart for it as I have for bewailing my fate;\nin short, as I was then a coward and a fool, little wonder is it if I\nam now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.\n\"The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long\ntime withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger\nto save her honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of\nthe truth on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, 'I\nwill:' Don Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood\nlinked by a knot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then\napproached to embrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her\nheart, fell fainting in her mother's arms. It only remains now for me\nto tell you the state I was in when in that consent that I heard I saw\nall my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved\nfalsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost\nrendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it\nseemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, the\nair refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears;\nit was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frame\nglowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusion by\nLuscinda's fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her air\na sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized at\nonce and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as\nhe had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his\nhand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in\nthe efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting\nfit.\n\"Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out\nregardless whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do\nsome frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous\nindignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don\nFernando, and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress. But my\nfate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so\nordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reason\nwhich has since been wanting to me; and so, without seeking to take\nvengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have been easily taken,\nas all thought of me was so far from their minds), I resolved to take\nit upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved,\nperhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to them\nhad I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which is\nprotracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In a word,\nI quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left my\nmule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him\nfarewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring to\nturn my head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in the\nopen country, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by the\nstillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of\nbeing heard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice in\nmaledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avenge\nthe wrong they had done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, false,\nthankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had\nblinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to transfer it\nto one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal. And yet, in\nthe midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I found\nexcuses for her, saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the\nseclusion of her parents' house, trained and schooled to obey them\nalways, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they\noffered her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, and\nnoble birth, that if she had refused to accept him she would have been\nthought out of her senses, or to have set her affection elsewhere, a\nsuspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I said,\nhad she declared I was her husband, they would have seen that in\nchoosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her,\nfor before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves could not\nhave desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a more\neligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking\nthe last fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that I\nhad already given her mine, for I should have come forward to support\nany assertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to the\nconclusion that feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a\ncraving for rank, had made her forget the words with which she had\ndeceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourable\npassion.\n\"Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder\nof the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these\nmountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking\nany path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not\nwhich side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in\nwhat direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that\nit was in this quarter, and I at once directed my course hither,\nintending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among these\ncrags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think\nmore likely, in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it\nbore in me. I was left on foot, worn out, famishing, without anyone to\nhelp me or any thought of seeking help: and so thus I lay stretched on\nthe ground, how long I know not, after which I rose up free from\nhunger, and found beside me some goatherds, who no doubt were the\npersons who had relieved me in my need, for they told me how they had\nfound me, and how I had been uttering ravings that showed plainly I had\nlost my reason; and since then I am conscious that I am not always in\nfull possession of it, but at times so deranged and crazed that I do a\nthousand mad things, tearing my clothes, crying aloud in these\nsolitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the dear name of her\nwho is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; and\nwhen I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and weary that I\ncan scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork\ntree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen and\ngoatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish me\nwith food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think\nI may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out\nof my senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain\nme, and make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so they\ntell me when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the\nroad, and though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force\nfrom the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do\npass the wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven's will to\nbring it to a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer\nrecollect the beauty and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by\nDon Fernando; for if it will do this without depriving me of life, I\nwill turn my thoughts into some better channel; if not, I can only\nimplore it to have full mercy on my soul, for in myself I feel no power\nor strength to release my body from this strait in which I have of my\nown accord chosen to place it.\n\"Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one\nthat can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not\ntrouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests\nas likely to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the\nmedicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will\nnot take it. I have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it\nis her pleasure to be another's, when she is or should be mine, let it\nbe mine to be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. She\nby her fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive\nto gratify her wishes by seeking destruction; and it will show\ngenerations to come that I alone was deprived of that of which all\nothers in misfortune have a superabundance, for to them the\nimpossibility of being consoled is itself a consolation, while to me it\nis the cause of greater sorrows and sufferings, for I think that even\nin death there will not be an end of them.\"",

He bribed all the household,\nhe gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was\nlike a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one could\nsleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand, no\none knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges,\ncontaining more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all\nwhich not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as\nif he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me\nyield were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred\nbearing of Don Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his\nimportunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction\nto find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction,\nand I was not displeased at seeing my praises in his letters (for\nhowever ugly we women may be, it seems to me it always pleases us to\nhear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own sense of right was\nopposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, who\nnow very plainly perceived Don Fernando's purpose, for he cared very\nlittle if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confided\ntheir honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade\nme consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which I\nmight conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the\ncontrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage;\nand if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his\nunreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to\nanyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or\nof any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good\nname, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their\nsound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando\na word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however\nremote.",

      "text": "\"All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had\napparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite\u2014for that is the\nname I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to\nbe, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no\noccasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were\ncontemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of\nobtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors\nto watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as\nyou shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other\ncompanion than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully\nlocked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I\nknow not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion\nand these precautions, and in the solitude and silence of my\nretirement, I found him standing before me, a vision that so astounded\nme that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no\npower to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he give me time to utter one,\nas he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms (for,\noverwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began\nto make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could have\nhad the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the\ntraitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and his\nsighs for his sincerity.\n\"I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases\nsuch as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying\nprotestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears\nto anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of\nbewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself,\nI said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed,\n'If, as I am now in your arms, se\u00f1or, I were in the claws of a fierce\nlion, and my deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything\nto the prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it\nor say it, than it would be possible that what was should not have\nbeen; so then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul\nsecured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will\nsee if you attempt to carry them into effect by force. I am your\nvassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor should\nhave any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-born\npeasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord and\ngentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealth\nwill have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, nor\nyour sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things I\nspeak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should\nbe mine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being\npreserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield\nhim what you, se\u00f1or, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you\nshould suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything\nof me.' 'If that,' said this disloyal gentleman, 'be the only scruple\nyou feel, fairest Dorothea' (for that is the name of this unhappy\nbeing), 'see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from\nwhich nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, be\nwitnesses of this pledge.'\"\nc28d.jpg (289K)\nFull Size\nWhen Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed fresh\nagitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but\nhe was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of\nwhat he already all but knew, so he merely said:\n\"What! is Dorothea your name, se\u00f1ora? I have heard of another of the\nsame name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed;\nby-and-by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it\nwill excite your compassion.\"\nDorothea was struck by Cardenio's words as well as by his strange and\nmiserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to\ntell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was\ncourage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure\nthat none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she\nendured already.\n\"I would not let the occasion pass, se\u00f1ora,\" replied Cardenio, \"of\ntelling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far\nthere has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to\nknow it.\"\n\"Be it as it may,\" replied Dorothea, \"what happened in my story was\nthat Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it\nas a witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and\nextravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though\nbefore he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well\nwhat he was doing, and think of the anger his father would feel at\nseeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him\nnot to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that was not\nenough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the love\nhe bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lot\nto follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages\nso unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long to\nafford the enjoyment they began with.\n\"All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I\ncannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his\npurpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself\nabout difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I\nargued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, 'I shall\nnot be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty\nstation, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more\nlikely, a blind attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank.\nThen, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well\navail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though his\ninclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I\nshall be, after all, his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him\nby scorn, I can see that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use\nforce, and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving\nmy innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to be\nin this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents that\nthis gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?'\n\"All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment;\nbut the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears\nhe shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace,\nwhich, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have\nconquered a heart even more free and coy than mine\u2014these were the\nthings that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to\nmy ruin. I called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness\non earth besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and\nrepeated his oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to\nthe former ones, called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter\nshould he fail to keep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled his\nsighs and pressed me closer in his arms, from which he had never\nallowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased to be\none, and he became a traitor and a perjured man.\n\"The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so",

      "text": "betrothal some strange things had happened.\"\nCardenio heard the name of Luscinda, but he only shrugged his\nshoulders, bit his lips, bent his brows, and before long two streams of\ntears escaped from his eyes. Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her\nstory, but went on in these words:\n\"This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck\nwith a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I\nscarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying\naloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was\nthe victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a\nresolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to\nassume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father's, one of\nthe zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the\nwhole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the\ncity where I heard my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for\nmy boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my\npurpose, offered to bear me company, as he said, to the end of the\nworld. I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman's dress, and\nsome jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence of\nthe night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth\nfrom the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, and\non foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by my\neagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be already\ndone, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what\nconscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and a\nhalf, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda's\nparents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought\nto know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred at\nthe betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such\nnotoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in\nthe street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando's betrothal with\nLuscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying 'Yes,'\nshe was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom\napproaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found\na paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she\ncould not be Don Fernando's bride, because she was already Cardenio's,\nwho, according to the man's account, was a gentleman of distinction of\nthe same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only\nin obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper\nmade it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the\nbetrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which\nwas confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her\nclothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had\nbefooled, slighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she had\nrecovered from her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger that\nhad been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those\nwho were present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don\nFernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her\nprostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she was\nreally the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides\nthat Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal;\nand that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he had\nquitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the\nwrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one\nshould ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the\ncity, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that\nLuscinda was missing from her father's house and from the city, for she\nwas not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who\nknew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my\nhopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to\nfind him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet\nentirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven\nhad put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead him\nto recognise his obligations under the former one, and reflect that as\na Christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects.\nAll this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself without\ncomfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that life\nthat I now abhor.\n\"But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find\nDon Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great\nreward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my\nage and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who\ncame with me had taken me away from my father's house; a thing that cut\nme to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was\nnot enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with\nwhom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my\nconsideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with\nmy servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to\nme, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most\nthickly wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one\nevil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the\nbeginning of one still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my\nworthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in\nthis lonely spot, moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty,\nsought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes\nseemed to present him, and with little shame and less fear of God and\nrespect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding that I\nreplied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe language,\nhe laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first, and began\nto use violence.\nc28e.jpg (324K)\nFull Size\n\"But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good\nintentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little\nexertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead\nor alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible\nin my terror and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any\nother thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and\nescaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders.\nIt is now I know not how many months since with this object I came\nhere, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place\nin the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him\nas herd, striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which have\nnow unexpectedly betrayed me. But all my care and pains were\nunavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, and\nharboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does not\nalways supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had no precipice\nor ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his passion,\nas I had in the servant's case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave him\nand again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of my\nstrength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went into\nhiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears\nimplore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and\nstrength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving\nno trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished",

For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the\nwhole story of my misfortunes.\"\n\"I am that unhappy being, se\u00f1ora,\" replied Cardenio, \"whom, as you have\nsaid, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate\nCardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your\npresent condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged,\nbereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only\npossess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to\nme. I, Dorothea, am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando,\nand waited to hear the 'Yes' uttered by which Luscinda owned herself\nhis betrothed: I am he who had not courage enough to see how her\nfainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in her\nbosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes\nof ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, and\nleaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him to place in\nLuscinda's hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to end\nhere the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But fate would not\nrid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhaps\nto preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for if\nthat which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to be, it may\nbe that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to\nour misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot\nmarry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself so openly declared,\nand that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we may\nreasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it is\nstill in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as we have\nthis consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I\nentreat you, se\u00f1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I\nmean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier\nfortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a\nChristian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don\nFernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his\nobligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my\nrank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on\naccount of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs,\nwhich I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself\nto yours.\"",

He, astonished\nat the stranger's words and behaviour, looked at him attentively, and\nat length recognised him, very much surprised to see him there, and\nmade great efforts to dismount. This, however, the curate would not\nallow, on which Don Quixote said, \"Permit me, se\u00f1or licentiate, for it\nis not fitting that I should be on horseback and so reverend a person\nas your worship on foot.\"\n\"On no account will I allow it,\" said the curate; \"your mightiness must\nremain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest\ndeeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an\nunworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches\nof one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if\nthey have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed\nPegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor,\nMuzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema,\na little distance from the great Complutum.\"\n\"Nor even that will I consent to, se\u00f1or licentiate,\" answered Don\nQuixote, \"and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the\nprincess, out of love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle\nof his mule to your worship, and he can sit behind if the beast will\nbear it.\"\n\"It will, I am sure,\" said the princess, \"and I am sure, too, that I\nneed not order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate to\nallow a Churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.\"\n\"That he is,\" said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his\nsaddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; but\nunfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it\nhappened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying\nill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in\nthe air, which would have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in\nquest of Don Quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or\nhead. As it was, they so took him by surprise that he came to the\nground, giving so little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he\ncould do when he found himself without it was to cover his face hastily\nwith both his hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don\nQuixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or\nblood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed:\n\"By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and\nplucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off\ndesignedly.\"\nThe curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme,\nat once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master\nNicholas lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast\nhad it on in an instant, muttering over him some words which he said\nwere a certain special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see;\nand as soon as he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared\nwell bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond\nmeasure astonished, and begged the curate to teach him that charm when\nhe had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its virtue must extend\nbeyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beard\nhad been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated,\nand when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards.\n\"And so it is,\" said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on\nthe first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate\nshould mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they\nreached the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.",

But one\nthing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst\nthou not perceive a Sab\u00e6an odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not\nwhat, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an\nexhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?\"\n\"All I can say is,\" said Sancho, \"that I did perceive a little odour,\nsomething goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with\nhard work.\"\n\"It could not be that,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must have been\nsuffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know\nwell what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of\nthe field, that dissolved amber.\"\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Sancho; \"there often comes from myself that same\nodour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea;\nbut that's no wonder, for one devil is like another.\"\n\"Well then,\" continued Don Quixote, \"now she has done sifting the corn\nand sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?\"\n\"As for the letter,\" said Sancho, \"she did not read it, for she said\nshe could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into\nsmall pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest\nher secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had\ntold her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the\nextraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to\nmake an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed\nyour hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write\nto you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of\nthis present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with\ncarrying on absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless\nsomething else of greater importance should happen, for she had a great\ndesire to see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how\nyour worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked\nher if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he\nhad, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley\nslaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.\"",

      "text": "\"So far all goes well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me what jewel was\nit that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of\nme? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant\nto give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their\nladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich\njewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message.\"\n\"That is very likely,\" said Sancho, \"and a good custom it was, to my\nmind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to\nbe the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that\nwas what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I\ntook leave of her; and more by token it was sheep's-milk cheese.\"\n\"She is generous in the extreme,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if she did not\ngive thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had\nnot one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter;\nI shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what\namazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through\nthe air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to\nEl Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here\nto there. From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who\nis my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there is\nand must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that\nthis same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thy\nknowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant\nsleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way it\nhappened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away\nfrom the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this,\nknights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril,\nas they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the\nmountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another\nknight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death;\nbut when he least looks for it, there appears over against him on a\ncloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just\nbefore had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him\nfrom death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping\nvery much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will\nhave been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the\ncraft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant\nknights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that\nthou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such\na short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have\ncarried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.\"\n\"That must have been it,\" said Sancho, \"for indeed Rocinante went like\na gipsy's ass with quicksilver in his ears.\"\n\"Quicksilver!\" said Don Quixote, \"aye and what is more, a legion of\ndevils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being\nweary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what\nthinkest thou I ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her?\nFor though I feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that\nI am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess that\naccompanies us, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for\nmy word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire to\nsee my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and\nthe glory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what I\nthink I shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly the\nplace where this giant is, and on my arrival I shall cut off his head,\nand establish the princess peacefully in her realm, and forthwith I\nshall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to whom I\nshall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay,\nfor she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame;\nfor all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life,\ncomes to me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers.\"\n\"Ah! what a sad state your worship's brains are in!\" said Sancho. \"Tell\nme, se\u00f1or, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let\nslip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a\nportion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than\ntwenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all things\nnecessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and\nCastile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you\nhave said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the\nfirst village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate\nwho will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give\nadvice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in\nthe hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good\nto his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not\ncome to him.\"\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"If thou art advising me to\nmarry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become\nking, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have\npromised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy\ndesires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a\nstipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry,\nthey shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon\nwhomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou\nhave me bestow it but upon thee?\"\n\"That is plain speaking,\" said Sancho; \"but let your worship take care\nto choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don't like the life, I may\nbe able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;\ndon't mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this\ngiant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it\nwill be one of great honour and great profit.\"\n\"I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I\nwill take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to\nsee Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to\nthose who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for\nas Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be\nknown it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\"",

      "text": "Master Nicholas here called out to them to wait a while, as they wanted\nto halt and drink at a little spring there was there. Don Quixote drew\nup, not a little to the satisfaction of Sancho, for he was by this time\nweary of telling so many lies, and in dread of his master catching him\ntripping, for though he knew that Dulcinea was a peasant girl of El\nToboso, he had never seen her in all his life. Cardenio had now put on\nthe clothes which Dorothea was wearing when they found her, and though\nthey were not very good, they were far better than those he put off.\nThey dismounted together by the side of the spring, and with what the\ncurate had provided himself with at the inn they appeased, though not\nvery well, the keen appetite they all of them brought with them.\nWhile they were so employed there happened to come by a youth passing\non his way, who stopping to examine the party at the spring, the next\nmoment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to\nweep freely, saying, \"O, se\u00f1or, do you not know me? Look at me well; I\nam that lad Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I\nwas tied.\"\nDon Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those\npresent and said: \"That your worships may see how important it is to\nhave knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by\ntyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days\nago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of\na person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my\nbounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me\nto proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before\nyou, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit\nme to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to\nan oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found\nto be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his\nmare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a\nflagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because he was\nhis servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from\ndishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, 'Se\u00f1or, he flogs me\nonly because I ask for my wages.' The master made I know not what\nspeeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not\naccept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he\nwould take him with him, and pay him real by real, and perfumed into\nthe bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark\nwith what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promised\nto do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer without\nhesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see\nthat it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant\nabroad.\"\n\"All that your worship has said is quite true,\" answered the lad; \"but\nthe end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your\nworship supposes.\"\n\"How! the opposite?\" said Don Quixote; \"did not the clown pay thee\nthen?\"\n\"Not only did he not pay me,\" replied the lad, \"but as soon as your\nworship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up\nagain to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a\nflayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up\nwith some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and\nbut for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he\nsaid. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until\nnow in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally\nclown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for\nif you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for\nyou, nor meddled in other people's affairs, my master would have been\ncontent with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then\nloosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him\nso out of measure, and gave him so many hard words, his anger was\nkindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you, as soon as he saw\nyou had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel as\nif I should never be a man again.\"\n\"The mischief,\" said Don Quixote, \"lay in my going away; for I should\nnot have gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known\nwell by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word\nif he finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest,\nAndres, that I swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him,\nand find him though he were to hide himself in the whale's belly.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but it was of no use.\"\n\"Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,\" said Don Quixote; and\nso saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was\nbrowsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to\ndo. He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise\nhim for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last\nmaravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To\nwhich she replied that he must remember that in accordance with his\npromise he could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded\nhers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain\nhis ardour until his return from her kingdom.\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and Andres must have patience until\nmy return as you say, se\u00f1ora; but I once more swear and promise not to\nstop until I have seen him avenged and paid.\"\n\"I have no faith in those oaths,\" said Andres; \"I would rather have now\nsomething to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the\nworld; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give\nit me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may\ntheir errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.\"\nSancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese,\nand giving them to the lad he said, \"Here, take this, brother Andres,\nfor we have all of us a share in your misfortune.\"\n\"Why, what share have you got?\"\n\"This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,\" answered Sancho; \"and\nGod knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I\nwould have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to\nbear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things\nmore easily felt than told.\"\nAndres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him\nanything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying\nis. However, before leaving he said, \"For the love of God, sir\nknight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them\ncutting me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my\nmisfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come to\nme by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant\nthat have ever been born God send his curse.\"\nDon Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at\nsuch a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily\nchapfallen was Don Quixote at Andres' story, and the others had to take\ngreat care to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out\nof countenance.",

On this\nthe barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the\nsame time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect\nDon Quixote's deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with\nastonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure\nof the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as\nthere was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment,\nserved them up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was\nasleep, and they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would\nnow do him more good than eating.\nWhile at dinner, the company consisting of the landlord, his wife,\ntheir daughter, Maritornes, and all the travellers, they discussed the\nstrange craze of Don Quixote and the manner in which he had been found;\nand the landlady told them what had taken place between him and the\ncarrier; and then, looking round to see if Sancho was there, when she\nsaw he was not, she gave them the whole story of his blanketing, which\nthey received with no little amusement. But on the curate observing\nthat it was the books of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that had\nturned his brain, the landlord said:\n\"I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is\nno better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them,\nwith other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of\nplenty more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on\nholidays, and there is always one among them who can read and who takes\nup one of these books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us,\nand stay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow\nyoung again. At least I can say for myself that when I hear of what\nfurious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the\nlonging to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them night\nand day.\"\n\"And I just as much,\" said the landlady, \"because I never have a quiet\nmoment in my house except when you are listening to someone reading;\nfor then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to\nscold.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Maritornes; \"and, faith, I relish hearing these\nthings greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when they\ndescribe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the\norange trees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead\nwith envy and fright; all this I say is as good as honey.\"\n\"And you, what do you think, young lady?\" said the curate turning to\nthe landlord's daughter.\n\"I don't know indeed, se\u00f1or,\" said she; \"I listen too, and to tell the\ntruth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not\nthe blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights\nutter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they\nsometimes make me weep with the pity I feel for them.\"\n\"Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?\"\nsaid Dorothea.\n\"I don't know what I should do,\" said the girl; \"I only know that there\nare some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers\nand lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don't know what\nsort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than\nbestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. I\ndon't know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour's\nsake, why not marry them? That's all they want.\"\n\"Hush, child,\" said the landlady; \"it seems to me thou knowest a great\ndeal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so\nmuch.\"\n\"As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,\" said the\ngirl.\n\"Well then,\" said the curate, \"bring me these books, se\u00f1or landlord,\nfor I should like to see them.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said he, and going into his own room he brought\nout an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the\ncurate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a\nvery good hand. The first that he opened he found to be \"Don Cirongilio\nof Thrace,\" and the second \"Don Felixmarte of Hircania,\" and the other\nthe \"History of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with\nthe Life of Diego Garc\u00eda de Paredes.\"\nWhen the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber\nand said, \"We want my friend's housekeeper and niece here now.\"\n\"Nay,\" said the barber, \"I can do just as well to carry them to the\nyard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.\"\n\"What! your worship would burn my books!\" said the landlord.\n\"Only these two,\" said the curate, \"Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.\"\n\"Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burn\nthem?\" said the landlord.\n\"Schismatics you mean, friend,\" said the barber, \"not phlegmatics.\"\n\"That's it,\" said the landlord; \"but if you want to burn any, let it be\nthat about the Great Captain and that Diego Garc\u00eda; for I would rather\nhave a child of mine burnt than either of the others.\"\n\"Brother,\" said the curate, \"those two books are made up of lies, and\nare full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true\nhistory, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by\nhis many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of\nthe Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him\nalone; and this Diego Garc\u00eda de Paredes was a distinguished knight of\nthe city of Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of\nsuch bodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in\nfull motion; and posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge\nhe kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved\nsuch other exploits that if, instead of his relating them himself with\nthe modesty of a knight and of one writing his own history, some free\nand unbiased writer had recorded them, they would have thrown into the\nshade all the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.\"\nc32b.jpg (395K)\nFull Size\n\"Tell that to my father,\" said the landlord. \"There's a thing to be\nastonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should read\nwhat I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single\nbackstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they\nhad been made of bean-pods like the little friars the children make;\nand another time he attacked a very great and powerful army, in which\nthere were more than a million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armed\nfrom head to foot, and he routed them all as if they had been flocks of\nsheep.\"\nc32c.jpg (341K)\nFull Size\n\"And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was\nso stout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related that\nas he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the\nwater against him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flung\nhimself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezed\nits throat with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he\nwas throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the\nbottom of the river, carrying with it the knight who would not let go\nhis hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palaces\nand gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent\nchanged itself into an old ancient man, who told him such things as\nwere never heard. Hold your peace, se\u00f1or; for if you were to hear this\nyou would go mad with delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain\nand your Diego Garc\u00eda!\"\nHearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, \"Our landlord is\nalmost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote.\"\n\"I think so,\" said Cardenio, \"for, as he shows, he accepts it as a\ncertainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it\nis written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not\npersuade him to the contrary.\"\n\"But consider, brother,\" said the curate once more, \"there never was\nany Felixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace,\nor any of the other knights of the same sort, that the books of\nchivalry talk of; the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of\nidle wits, devised by them for the purpose you describe of beguiling\nthe time, as your reapers do when they read; for I swear to you in all\nseriousness there never were any such knights in the world, and no such\nexploits or nonsense ever happened anywhere.\"\n\"Try that bone on another dog,\" said the landlord; \"as if I did not\nknow how many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don't think to\nfeed me with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your\nworship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is\nnonsense and lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the\nRoyal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a lot of\nlies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantments\nthat they take away one's senses.\"\n\"I have told you, friend,\" said the curate, \"that this is done to\ndivert our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess,\nfives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not\ncare, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind\nare allowed to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the\ntruth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true\nstories; and if it were permitted me now, and the present company\ndesired it, I could say something about the qualities books of chivalry\nshould possess to be good ones, that would be to the advantage and even\nto the taste of some; but I hope the time will come when I can\ncommunicate my ideas to someone who may be able to mend matters; and in\nthe meantime, se\u00f1or landlord, believe what I have said, and take your\nbooks, and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood, and much\ngood may they do you; and God grant you may not fall lame of the same\nfoot your guest Don Quixote halts on.\"\n\"No fear of that,\" returned the landlord; \"I shall not be so mad as to\nmake a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things are\nnot now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous\nknights roamed about the world.\"\nSancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and\nhe was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about\nknights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry\nbeing folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what\ncame of this journey of his master's, and if it did not turn out as\nhappily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go back\nto his wife and children and his ordinary labour.",

I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear\nor want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of\ntemptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these reasons\nand many others that I could give thee to justify and support the\nopinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass this\ncrisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed\nand by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes out,\nas I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon my\ngood fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my\ndesire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says 'Who\nshall find her?' has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the\ncontrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have\nbeen right in my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which\nmy so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothing\nof all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me\nfrom carrying it into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that\nthou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this\npurpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee opportunities to\nthat end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary for\nthe pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded woman.\nAnd among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task to\nthee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the\nconquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to account\nthat accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone;\nthus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and my\nwrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know\nwell will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me. If,\ntherefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thou\nwilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor\nslothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and\nwith the loyalty our friendship assures me of.\"",

      "text": "sake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to\nput aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it\nshould not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in\nsuch as affect the friend's life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in\nwhich of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to\ngratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me?\nNeither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as I\nunderstand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and to\nrob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour it\nis plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse than\ndead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much\nwrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and\nconsequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not\nimpatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the\nobject of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee to\nreply and for me to hear.\"\n\"Be it so,\" said Anselmo, \"say what thou wilt.\"\nLothario then went on to say, \"It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is\njust now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can\nnever be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the\nHoly Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the\nunderstanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have\nexamples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not\nadmitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be\ndenied, like, '_If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are\nequal:_' and if they do not understand this in words, and indeed they\ndo not, it has to be shown to them with the hands, and put before their\neyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the\ntruth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall have\nto adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so\nabsurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that\nI feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy\nsimplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I am\neven tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy\npernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allow\nme to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me from\ndealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see this, say,\nAnselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modest\nwoman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is\npure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me\nso. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous,\npure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thou\nbelievest that she will come forth victorious from all my attacks\u2014as\ndoubtless she would\u2014what higher titles than those she possesses now\ndost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then, or in what will she be\nbetter then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her to be what\nthou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If thou dost\nnot hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek to prove her\ninstead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best to\nthee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an\nuncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after\ntrial, it will but be in the same estimation as before. Thus, then, it\nis conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than\nadvantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds,\nmore especially when they are things which we are not forced or\ncompelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly\nmadness to attempt them.\n\"Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake\nof the world, or for both; those undertaken for God's sake are those\nwhich the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of\nangels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are\nthose of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a\nvariety of climates, so many strange countries, to acquire what are\ncalled the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of\nGod and the world together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner\ndo they see in the enemy's wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could\nmake, than, casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the\nmanifest peril that threatens them, borne onward by the desire of\ndefending their faith, their country, and their king, they fling\nthemselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths\nthat await them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and\nthere is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full of\ndifficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy\nwish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of God nor\nthe blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue be\nas thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more\nhonoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be\nreduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will avail\nthee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has\nbefallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou\nknowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let\nme repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at\nthe end of the first part of his 'Tears of Saint Peter,' which says\nthus:\nThe anguish and the shame but greater grew\nIn Peter's heart as morning slowly came;\nNo eye was there to see him, well he knew,\nYet he himself was to himself a shame;\nExposed to all men's gaze, or screened from view,\nA noble heart will feel the pang the same;\nA prey to shame the sinning soul will be,\nThough none but heaven and earth its shame can see.\nThus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather\nthou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of\nblood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet\ntells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo,\nbetter advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction\nit contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation.\nMoreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the\ngreat error thou wouldst commit.\n\"Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and\nlawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence\nand purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been\nsatisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in purity,\nquality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could\npossibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing\nnothing to the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire to\ntake that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and by\nmere force of blows and strength of arm try if it were as hard and as\nfine as they said? And if thou didst, and if the stone should resist so\nsilly a test, that would add nothing to its value or reputation; and if\nit were broken, as it might be, would not all be lost? Undoubtedly it\nwould, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool in the opinion of all.\nConsider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a diamond of the\nfinest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, and that\nit is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; for\nif she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value than she now\npossesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist, bethink thee\nnow how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what good reason thou\nwilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruin and\nthine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as a\nchaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consists\nin reputation; and since thy wife's is of that high excellence that\nthou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in\nquestion? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and\nthat impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip and\nfall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear of all\nobstacles, so that without hindrance she may run her course freely to\nattain the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous.\nNaturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur\nof purest white, and that when the hunters wish to take it, they make\nuse of this artifice. Having ascertained the places which it frequents\nand passes, they stop the way to them with mud, and then rousing it,\ndrive it towards the spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud\nit halts, and allows itself to be taken captive rather than pass\nthrough the mire, and spoil and sully its whiteness, which it values\nmore than life and liberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine,\nand whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he who\nwishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt a\ncourse different from that employed with the ermine; he must not put\nbefore her the mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers,\nbecause perhaps\u2014and even without a perhaps\u2014she may not have sufficient\nvirtue and natural strength in herself to pass through and tread under\nfoot these impediments; they must be removed, and the brightness of\nvirtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before her. A virtuous\nwoman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal, liable to be\ntarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. She must be\ntreated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be protected and\nprized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and\nflowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a\nblossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating\nthey may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat to\nthee some verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy,\nand it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing. A\nprudent old man was giving advice to another, the father of a young\ngirl, to lock her up, watch over her and keep her in seclusion, and\namong other arguments he used these:\nWoman is a thing of glass;\nBut her brittleness 'tis best\nNot too curiously to test:\nWho knows what may come to pass?\nBreaking is an easy matter,\nAnd it's folly to expose\nWhat you cannot mend to blows;\nWhat you can't make whole to shatter.\nThis, then, all may hold as true,\nAnd the reason's plain to see;\nFor if Dana\u00ebs there be,\nThere are golden showers too.\n\"All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to\nwhat concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what\nregards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into\nwhich thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate\nthee makes it necessary.\n\"Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a\nthing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim\nat this, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thou\nwouldst rob me of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court\nto her as thou requirest, she will certainly regard me as a man without\nhonour or right feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed\nto what I owe to my own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst\nhave me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I\npress my suit upon her, will suppose that I have perceived in her\nsomething light that has encouraged me to make known to her my base\ndesire; and if she holds herself dishonoured, her dishonour touches\nthee as belonging to her; and hence arises what so commonly takes\nplace, that the husband of the adulterous woman, though he may not be\naware of or have given any cause for his wife's failure in her duty, or\n(being careless or negligent) have had it in his power to prevent his\ndishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name,\nand in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by all\nwho know of his wife's guilt, though they see that he is unfortunate\nnot by his own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort. But I will\ntell thee why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of the\nunchaste wife, though he know not that she is so, nor be to blame, nor\nhave done anything, or given any provocation to make her so; and be not\nweary with listening to me, for it will be for thy good.\n\"When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy\nScripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took\na rib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when\nAdam awoke and beheld her he said, 'This is flesh of my flesh, and bone\nof my bone.' And God said 'For this shall a man leave his father and\nhis mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted\nthe divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can\nloose them. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous\nsacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh;\nand even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though they\nhave two souls they have but one will. And hence it follows that as the\nflesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her husband the\nstains that may come upon it, or the injuries it incurs fall upon the\nhusband's flesh, though he, as has been said, may have given no cause\nfor them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is felt\nby the whole body, because all is one flesh, as the head feels the hurt\nto the ankle without having caused it, so the husband, being one with\nher, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly honour or\ndishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife's is of that\nkind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be held\ndishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou art\nencountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;\nsee for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up\npassions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;\nreflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thou\nwilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words to\nexpress it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thy\nvile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour\nand misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thy\nfriendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.\"\nHaving said this, the wise and virtuous Lothario was silent, and\nAnselmo, troubled in mind and deep in thought, was unable for a while\nto utter a word in reply; but at length he said, \"I have listened,\nLothario my friend, attentively, as thou hast seen, to what thou hast\nchosen to say to me, and in thy arguments, examples, and comparisons I\nhave seen that high intelligence thou dost possess, and the perfection\nof true friendship thou hast reached; and likewise I see and confess\nthat if I am not guided by thy opinion, but follow my own, I am flying\nfrom the good and pursuing the evil. This being so, thou must remember\nthat I am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes\nsuffer from, when the craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster,\ncharcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look at, much more to\neat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some artifice to\ncure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a\nbeginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to\npay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her virtue will\ngive way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall rest\nsatisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to\ndo, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard my\nhonour. And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that,\nbeing, as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee to\npermit me to reveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honour\nthou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as\nhigh as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying\ncourt to her, that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on\nfinding in her that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the\nplain truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her\nesteem; and as thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canst\nafford me so much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if\nfurther difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have said,\nif thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue\ndecided.\"\nLothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing\nwhat further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to\ndissuade him from it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his\npernicious scheme to someone else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to\ngratify him and do what he asked, intending to manage the business so\nas to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in\nreply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other, for he\nwould undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he\npleased. Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thanked\nhim for his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him; and",

Lothario\nsaw himself in the lists according to his friend's wish, and facing an\nenemy that could by her beauty alone vanquish a squadron of armed\nknights; judge whether he had good reason to fear; but what he did was\nto lean his elbow on the arm of the chair, and his cheek upon his hand,\nand, asking Camilla's pardon for his ill manners, he said he wished to\ntake a little sleep until Anselmo returned. Camilla in reply said he\ncould repose more at his ease in the reception-room than in his chair,\nand begged of him to go in and sleep there; but Lothario declined, and\nthere he remained asleep until the return of Anselmo, who finding\nCamilla in her own room, and Lothario asleep, imagined that he had\nstayed away so long as to have afforded them time enough for\nconversation and even for sleep, and was all impatience until Lothario\nshould wake up, that he might go out with him and question him as to\nhis success. Everything fell out as he wished; Lothario awoke, and the\ntwo at once left the house, and Anselmo asked what he was anxious to\nknow, and Lothario in answer told him that he had not thought it\nadvisable to declare himself entirely the first time, and therefore had\nonly extolled the charms of Camilla, telling her that all the city\nspoke of nothing else but her beauty and wit, for this seemed to him an\nexcellent way of beginning to gain her good-will and render her\ndisposed to listen to him with pleasure the next time, thus availing\nhimself of the device the devil has recourse to when he would deceive\none who is on the watch; for he being the angel of darkness transforms\nhimself into an angel of light, and, under cover of a fair seeming,\ndiscloses himself at length, and effects his purpose if at the\nbeginning his wiles are not discovered. All this gave great\nsatisfaction to Anselmo, and he said he would afford the same\nopportunity every day, but without leaving the house, for he would find\nthings to do at home so that Camilla should not detect the plot.\nThus, then, several days went by, and Lothario, without uttering a word\nto Camilla, reported to Anselmo that he had talked with her and that he\nhad never been able to draw from her the slightest indication of\nconsent to anything dishonourable, nor even a sign or shadow of hope;\non the contrary, he said she would inform her husband of it.\n\"So far well,\" said Anselmo; \"Camilla has thus far resisted words; we\nmust now see how she will resist deeds. I will give you to-morrow two\nthousand crowns in gold for you to offer or even present, and as many\nmore to buy jewels to lure her, for women are fond of being becomingly\nattired and going gaily dressed, and all the more so if they are\nbeautiful, however chaste they may be; and if she resists this\ntemptation, I will rest satisfied and will give you no more trouble.\"\nLothario replied that now he had begun he would carry on the\nundertaking to the end, though he perceived he was to come out of it\nwearied and vanquished. The next day he received the four thousand\ncrowns, and with them four thousand perplexities, for he knew not what\nto say by way of a new falsehood; but in the end he made up his mind to\ntell him that Camilla stood as firm against gifts and promises as\nagainst words, and that there was no use in taking any further trouble,\nfor the time was all spent to no purpose.\nBut chance, directing things in a different manner, so ordered it that\nAnselmo, having left Lothario and Camilla alone as on other occasions,\nshut himself into a chamber and posted himself to watch and listen\nthrough the keyhole to what passed between them, and perceived that for\nmore than half an hour Lothario did not utter a word to Camilla, nor\nwould utter a word though he were to be there for an age; and he came\nto the conclusion that what his friend had told him about the replies\nof Camilla was all invention and falsehood, and to ascertain if it were\nso, he came out, and calling Lothario aside asked him what news he had",

For his\nimagination was so wrought upon by the adventure he was going to\naccomplish, that it made him dream he had already reached the kingdom\nof Micomicon, and was engaged in combat with his enemy; and believing\nhe was laying on the giant, he had given so many sword cuts to the\nskins that the whole room was full of wine. On seeing this the landlord\nwas so enraged that he fell on Don Quixote, and with his clenched fist\nbegan to pummel him in such a way, that if Cardenio and the curate had\nnot dragged him off, he would have brought the war of the giant to an\nend. But in spite of all the poor gentleman never woke until the barber\nbrought a great pot of cold water from the well and flung it with one\ndash all over his body, on which Don Quixote woke up, but not so\ncompletely as to understand what was the matter. Dorothea, seeing how\nshort and slight his attire was, would not go in to witness the battle\nbetween her champion and her opponent.

The curate was holding Don Quixote's hands,\nwho, fancying he had now ended the adventure and was in the presence of\nthe Princess Micomicona, knelt before the curate and said, \"Exalted and\nbeauteous lady, your highness may live from this day forth fearless of\nany harm this base being could do you; and I too from this day forth am\nreleased from the promise I gave you, since by the help of God on high\nand by the favour of her by whom I live and breathe, I have fulfilled\nit so successfully.\"\n\"Did not I say so?\" said Sancho on hearing this. \"You see I wasn't\ndrunk; there you see my master has already salted the giant; there's no\ndoubt about the bulls; my county is all right!\"\nWho could have helped laughing at the absurdities of the pair, master\nand man? And laugh they did, all except the landlord, who cursed\nhimself; but at length the barber, Cardenio, and the curate contrived\nwith no small trouble to get Don Quixote on the bed, and he fell asleep\nwith every appearance of excessive weariness. They left him to sleep,\nand came out to the gate of the inn to console Sancho Panza on not\nhaving found the head of the giant; but much more work had they to\nappease the landlord, who was furious at the sudden death of his\nwine-skins; and said the landlady half scolding, half crying, \"At an\nevil moment and in an unlucky hour he came into my house, this\nknight-errant\u2014would that I had never set eyes on him, for dear he has\ncost me; the last time he went off with the overnight score against him\nfor supper, bed, straw, and barley, for himself and his squire and a\nhack and an ass, saying he was a knight adventurer\u2014God send unlucky\nadventures to him and all the adventurers in the world\u2014and therefore\nnot bound to pay anything, for it was so settled by the knight-errantry\ntariff: and then, all because of him, came the other gentleman and\ncarried off my tail, and gives it back more than two cuartillos the\nworse, all stripped of its hair, so that it is no use for my husband's\npurpose; and then, for a finishing touch to all, to burst my wine-skins\nand spill my wine! I wish I saw his own blood spilt! But let him not\ndeceive himself, for, by the bones of my father and the shade of my\nmother, they shall pay me down every quarto; or my name is not what it\nis, and I am not my father's daughter.\" All this and more to the same\neffect the landlady delivered with great irritation, and her good maid\nMaritornes backed her up, while the daughter held her peace and smiled\nfrom time to time. The curate smoothed matters by promising to make\ngood all losses to the best of his power, not only as regarded the\nwine-skins but also the wine, and above all the depreciation of the\ntail which they set such store by. Dorothea comforted Sancho, telling\nhim that she pledged herself, as soon as it should appear certain that\nhis master had decapitated the giant, and she found herself peacefully\nestablished in her kingdom, to bestow upon him the best county there\nwas in it. With this Sancho consoled himself, and assured the princess\nshe might rely upon it that he had seen the head of the giant, and more\nby token it had a beard that reached to the girdle, and that if it was\nnot to be seen now it was because everything that happened in that\nhouse went by enchantment, as he himself had proved the last time he\nhad lodged there.

He\nreturned, uneasy, to tell Camilla, but not finding her in bed or\nanywhere in the house he was lost in amazement. He asked the servants\nof the house about her, but none of them could give him any\nexplanation.

He\nknew not what to think, or say, or do, and his reason seemed to be\ndeserting him little by little. He reviewed his position, and saw\nhimself in a moment left without wife, friend, or servants, abandoned,\nhe felt, by the heaven above him, and more than all robbed of his\nhonour, for in Camilla's disappearance he saw his own ruin. After long\nreflection he resolved at last to go to his friend's village, where he\nhad been staying when he afforded opportunities for the contrivance of\nthis complication of misfortune. He locked the doors of his house,\nmounted his horse, and with a broken spirit set out on his journey; but\nhe had hardly gone half-way when, harassed by his reflections, he had\nto dismount and tie his horse to a tree, at the foot of which he threw\nhimself, giving vent to piteous heartrending sighs; and there he\nremained till nearly nightfall, when he observed a man approaching on\nhorseback from the city, of whom, after saluting him, he asked what was\nthe news in Florence.\nThe citizen replied, \"The strangest that have been heard for many a\nday; for it is reported abroad that Lothario, the great friend of the\nwealthy Anselmo, who lived at San Giovanni, carried off last night\nCamilla, the wife of Anselmo, who also has disappeared. All this has\nbeen told by a maid-servant of Camilla's, whom the governor found last\nnight lowering herself by a sheet from the windows of Anselmo's house.\nI know not indeed, precisely, how the affair came to pass; all I know\nis that the whole city is wondering at the occurrence, for no one could\nhave expected a thing of the kind, seeing the great and intimate\nfriendship that existed between them, so great, they say, that they\nwere called 'The Two Friends.'\"\n\"Is it known at all,\" said Anselmo, \"what road Lothario and Camilla\ntook?\"\n\"Not in the least,\" said the citizen, \"though the governor has been\nvery active in searching for them.\"\n\"God speed you, se\u00f1or,\" said Anselmo.",

Finding himself alone he\nso took to heart the thought of his misfortune that by the signs of\ndeath he felt within him he knew well his life was drawing to a close,\nand therefore he resolved to leave behind him a declaration of the\ncause of his strange end. He began to write, but before he had put down\nall he meant to say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life,\na victim to the suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailed\nupon him. The master of the house observing that it was now late and\nthat Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if his\nindisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his face, his body\npartly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he lay with\nthe written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having first\ncalled to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,\nand taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he was\ndead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to\nwitness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the\npaper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which\ncontained these words:\n\"A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of\nmy death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgive\nher, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have\nrequired her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my\nown dishonour, there is no reason why\u2014\"\nSo far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,\nbefore he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. The\nnext day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives,\nwho had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent\nwhere Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on\nthat inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death,\nbut because of those she received of her lover's departure. Although\nshe saw herself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the\nconvent or take the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence\nreached her that Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de\nLautrec had been recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo\nFernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples, whither her too late\nrepentant lover had repaired. On learning this Camilla took the veil,\nand shortly afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy. This was\nthe end of all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning.",

See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden\nfrom our sight, has brought me face to face with my true husband; and\nwell you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able\nto efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead\nyou, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, your\naffection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up\nin the presence of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may\nbe by my death he will be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the\nlast moment of life.\"\nMeanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words,\nby means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando\ndid not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as\nwell as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of\nbright and touching tears addressed him thus:\n\"If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine\narms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen\nby this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt\nhave it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly\npeasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst\nraise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion\nof innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy\nimportunity, and thy true and tender passion, as it seemed, she opened\nthe gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her\nliberty; a gift received by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shown\nby my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me, and by thy\nappearance under the circumstances in which I see thee. Nevertheless, I\nwould not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame;\nit is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that\nhave led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so follow\nthy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help\nbeing mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear\nthee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou\nwouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda's because thou\nart mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio's; and it will\nbe easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than\nto lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address\nthyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert\nnot ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to\nthy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and\nif it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a\ngentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy\nat last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I\nam, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave,\nfor so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do\nnot by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the\nstreets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal\nservices they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not\ndeserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy\nblood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no\nnobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that in\nillustrious lineages it is not the woman's blood that is of account;\nand, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art\nwanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I\nhave higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end, se\u00f1or, these\nare my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy\nwife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if\nthou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me;\nwitness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which\nthou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and\nif all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its\nsilent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of\nwhat I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.\"",

      "text": "All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest\nfeeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don\nFernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened\nto her without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such\nsobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not\nsoftened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her\nwith no less compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her\nintelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her to say some words\nof comfort to her, but was prevented by Don Fernando's grasp which held\nher fast. He, overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after\nregarding Dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms,\nand, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:\n\"Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is\nimpossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many\ntruths.\"\nLuscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground\nwhen Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having\nretreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside\nand regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and\nsaid as he clasped her in his arms, \"If Heaven in its compassion is\nwilling to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant,\nand fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that\nnow receive thee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me to\ncall thee mine.\"\nAt these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to\nrecognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that\nit was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all\nconsiderations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and\npressing her face close to his, said, \"Yes, my dear lord, you are the\ntrue master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose\nagain, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.\"\nA strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,\nfilled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied\nthat Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take\nvengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;\nand the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she\nclasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to\nprevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, \"What\nis it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou\nhast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife\nis in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right for\nthee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has\ndone, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be\nthy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth and\nconstancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love the\nface and bosom of her lawful husband. For God's sake I entreat of thee,\nfor thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thy\nanger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in\npeace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heaven\npermits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy\nlofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason has\nmore influence than passion.\"\nAll the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda\nin his arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he\nsaw him make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist\nas best he could all who might assail him, though it should cost him\nhis life. But now Don Fernando's friends, as well as the curate and the\nbarber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy\nSancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating\nhim to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her\nreasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed,\nwhat she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it was\nnot, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition of\nProvidence that they had all met in a place where no one could have\nexpected a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only death\ncould part Luscinda from Cardenio; that even if some sword were to\nseparate them they would think their death most happy; and that in a\ncase that admitted of no remedy his wisest course was, by conquering\nand putting a constraint upon himself, to show a generous mind, and of\nhis own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven had\ngranted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon the beauty of\nDorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much less excel\nher; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the\nsurpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him\nthat if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he\ncould not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing\nso he would obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who\nknow and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of\nhumble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself\nto the level of any rank, without any slur upon him who places it upon\nan equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of\npassion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he\nis not to be blamed who gives way to it.\nTo be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don\nFernando's manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was\ntouched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he\ncould not gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the\ngood advice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and\nembracing Dorothea, saying to her, \"Rise, dear lady, it is not right\nthat what I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if\nuntil now I have shown no sign of what I own, it may have been by\nHeaven's decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you love\nme, I may learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of you is\nthat you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous\nwrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you\nmine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this,\nturn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see\nin them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gained\nthe object of her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all\nmy wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as many happy years\nwith her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to live\nwith my Dorothea;\" and with these words he once more embraced her and\npressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to take\ngreat heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love and\nrepentance in the sight of all.

When she\nhad finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city\nafter he had found in Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she declared\nthat she was Cardenio's wife, and never could be his. He said he meant\nto kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her\nparents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and\nresolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should\noffer. The next day he learned that Luscinda had disappeared from her\nfather's house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone.\nFinally, at the end of some months he ascertained that she was in a\nconvent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if she were\nnot to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this,\ntaking these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place\nwhere she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it were\nknown he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent;\nand watching a time when the porter's lodge was open he left two to\nguard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest of\nLuscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of\nthe nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, they\nreached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they\nrequired for taking her away; all which they were able to do in\ncomplete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable\ndistance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in\nhis power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself\ndid nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in\nsilence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching\nheaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.",

      "text": "by a traveller who at this moment entered the inn, and who seemed from\nhis attire to be a Christian lately come from the country of the Moors,\nfor he was dressed in a short-skirted coat of blue cloth with\nhalf-sleeves and without a collar; his breeches were also of blue\ncloth, and his cap of the same colour, and he wore yellow buskins and\nhad a Moorish cutlass slung from a baldric across his breast. Behind\nhim, mounted upon an ass, there came a woman dressed in Moorish\nfashion, with her face veiled and a scarf on her head, and wearing a\nlittle brocaded cap, and a mantle that covered her from her shoulders\nto her feet. The man was of a robust and well-proportioned frame, in\nage a little over forty, rather swarthy in complexion, with long\nmoustaches and a full beard, and, in short, his appearance was such\nthat if he had been well dressed he would have been taken for a person\nof quality and good birth. On entering he asked for a room, and when\nthey told him there was none in the inn he seemed distressed, and\napproaching her who by her dress seemed to be a Moor, he took her down\nfrom the saddle in his arms. Luscinda, Dorothea, the landlady, her\ndaughter and Maritornes, attracted by the strange, and to them entirely\nnew costume, gathered round her; and Dorothea, who was always kindly,\ncourteous, and quick-witted, perceiving that both she and the man who\nhad brought her were annoyed at not finding a room, said to her, \"Do\nnot be put out, se\u00f1ora, by the discomfort and want of luxuries here,\nfor it is the way of road-side inns to be without them; still, if you\nwill be pleased to share our lodging with us (pointing to Luscinda)\nperhaps you will have found worse accommodation in the course of your\njourney.\"\nTo this the veiled lady made no reply; all she did was to rise from her\nseat, crossing her hands upon her bosom, bowing her head and bending\nher body as a sign that she returned thanks. From her silence they\nconcluded that she must be a Moor and unable to speak a Christian\ntongue.\nAt this moment the captive came up, having been until now otherwise\nengaged, and seeing that they all stood round his companion and that\nshe made no reply to what they addressed to her, he said, \"Ladies, this\ndamsel hardly understands my language and can speak none but that of\nher own country, for which reason she does not and cannot answer what\nhas been asked of her.\"\n\"Nothing has been asked of her,\" returned Luscinda; \"she has only been\noffered our company for this evening and a share of the quarters we\noccupy, where she shall be made as comfortable as the circumstances\nallow, with the good-will we are bound to show all strangers that stand\nin need of it, especially if it be a woman to whom the service is\nrendered.\"\n\"On her part and my own, se\u00f1ora,\" replied the captive, \"I kiss your\nhands, and I esteem highly, as I ought, the favour you have offered,\nwhich, on such an occasion and coming from persons of your appearance,\nis, it is plain to see, a very great one.\"\n\"Tell me, se\u00f1or,\" said Dorothea, \"is this lady a Christian or a Moor?\nfor her dress and her silence lead us to imagine that she is what we\ncould wish she was not.\"\n\"In dress and outwardly,\" said he, \"she is a Moor, but at heart she is\na thoroughly good Christian, for she has the greatest desire to become\none.\"\n\"Then she has not been baptised?\" returned Luscinda.\n\"There has been no opportunity for that,\" replied the captive, \"since\nshe left Algiers, her native country and home; and up to the present\nshe has not found herself in any such imminent danger of death as to\nmake it necessary to baptise her before she has been instructed in all\nthe ceremonies our holy mother Church ordains; but, please God, ere\nlong she shall be baptised with the solemnity befitting her which is\nhigher than her dress or mine indicates.\"\nBy these words he excited a desire in all who heard him, to know who\nthe Moorish lady and the captive were, but no one liked to ask just\nthen, seeing that it was a fitter moment for helping them to rest",

      "text": "when he supped with the goatherds, begin to address them:\n\"Verily, gentlemen, if we reflect upon it, great and marvellous are the\nthings they see, who make profession of the order of knight-errantry.\nSay, what being is there in this world, who entering the gate of this\ncastle at this moment, and seeing us as we are here, would suppose or\nimagine us to be what we are? Who would say that this lady who is\nbeside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am\nthat Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the\nmouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling\nsurpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more\ndeserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more\nexposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have the\npreeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that\nthey know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly\nassign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the\nmind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment\nto the body alone; as if the calling were a porter's trade, for which\nnothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who\nprofess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the\nexecution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of\nthe warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his\ncare, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay; see whether\nby bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of\nthe enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off\nimpending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them\nthe body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the\nmind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that\nof the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this\nwill be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that\npurpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object.\nThe end and goal of letters\u2014I am not speaking now of divine letters,\nthe aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an\nend so infinite no other can be compared\u2014I speak of human letters, the\nend of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man\nthat which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed:\nan end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not\nsuch as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their\nend and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this\nlife. The first good news the world and mankind received was that which\nthe angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in\nthe air, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of\ngood-will;' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and\nearth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any\nhouse, was to say, 'Peace be on this house;' and many other times he\nsaid to them, 'My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be\nwith you;' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a\njewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in\nheaven. This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name\nfor arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and\nthat so far it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to\nthe bodily labours of the man of letters, and those of him who follows\nthe profession of arms, and see which are the greater.\"\nDon Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such\ncorrect language, that for the time being he made it impossible for any\nof his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were\nmostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they\nlistened to him with great pleasure as he continued: \"Here, then, I say\nis what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all\nare poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have\nsaid that he endures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about\nhis hard fortune, for he who is poor has no share of the good things of\nlife. This poverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or\nnakedness, or all together; but for all that it is not so extreme but\nthat he gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhat\nunseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatest\nmisery of the student is what they themselves call 'going out for\nsoup,' and there is always some neighbour's brazier or hearth for them,\nwhich, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and\nlastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof. I will not go\ninto other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no\nsuperabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging\nthemselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated them\nto a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, rough\nand hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fall\nagain, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we have\nseen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as\nif borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I\nsay, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their hunger turned\ninto satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine\nraiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, the\njustly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared with\nwhat the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of\nit, as I am now about to show.\"\nc37e.jpg (13K)\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND\nLETTERS\nc38a.jpg (180K)\nFull Size\nContinuing his discourse Don Quixote said: \"As we began in the\nstudent's case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if\nthe soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there\nis no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes\nlate or never, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling\nhis life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great\nthat a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the\ndepth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the\nweather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his\nmouth, which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out\ncold, contrary to the laws of nature. To be sure he looks forward to\nthe approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed\nthat awaits him, which, unless by some fault of his, never sins by\nbeing over narrow, for he can easily measure out on the ground as he\nlikes, and roll himself about in it to his heart's content without any\nfear of the sheets slipping away from him. Then, after all this,\nsuppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his calling to have\ncome; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest him\nwith the doctor's cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps,\nthat has gone through his temples, or left him with a crippled arm or\nleg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him\nand keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the same poverty\nhe was in before, and he must go through more engagements and more\nbattles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself; but\nmiracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have\never reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war\nfall short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you\nwill reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be\nnumbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with\nthree figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters;\nfor by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of\nsupport; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is\nmuch less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to\nreward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by\ngiving them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their\ncalling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very\nproperty of the master they serve; but this impossibility only\nstrengthens my argument.\n\"Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which\nit is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of\narms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments\nput forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters\nsay that without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too,\nhas its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of\nletters and men of letters. To this arms make answer that without them\nlaws cannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms\npreserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates;\nand, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies,\ncities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and\nconfusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to\nmake use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that\nwhatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attain\nto eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness,\nheadaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I\nhave already referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary course\nof things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and\nin an incomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk of\nlosing his life. For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or\nharass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds\nhimself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin\nor cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post\nwhere he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly\nfrom the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to inform\nhis captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a\ncounter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the\nmoment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into\nthe deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us\nsee whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys\nstem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one\nwith the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two\nfeet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him\nthreatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the\nfoe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, and sees too that\nwith the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities\nof Neptune's bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that\nnerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and\nstruggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy's ship. And what is\nstill more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he\nwill never rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his\nplace; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an\nenemy, another and another will succeed him without a moment's pause\nbetween their deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all the\nchances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread\nfury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am\npersuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention,\nby which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life\nof a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in\nthe height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave\nhearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one\nwho fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine,\nwhich in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life\nof one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect\non this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having\nadopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we\nlive in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me\nsome uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the\nopportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known\nearth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But Heaven's\nwill be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more\nhonoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of\nyore exposed themselves to.\"",

This\ntendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having\nbeen a soldier in his youth, for the soldier's life is a school in\nwhich the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and\nif any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters of\nrare occurrence. My father went beyond liberality and bordered on\nprodigality, a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man\nwho has children to succeed to his name and position. My father had\nthree, all sons, and all of sufficient age to make choice of a\nprofession. Finding, then, that he was unable to resist his propensity,\nhe resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause of his\nprodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without which\nAlexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us all\nthree aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words somewhat to\nthe following effect:\n\"My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or said\nthan that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not\nlove you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no\nself-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned;\ntherefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like a\nfather, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do\nwith you what I have for some time back meditated, and after mature\ndeliberation decided upon. You are now of an age to choose your line of\nlife or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour\nand profit when you are older; and what I have resolved to do is to\ndivide my property into four parts; three I will give to you, to each\nhis portion without making any difference, and the other I will retain\nto live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life Heaven\nmay be pleased to grant me. But I wish each of you on taking possession\nof the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths I shall\nindicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to my mind very\ntrue\u2014as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from long practical\nexperience\u2014and the one I refer to says, 'The church, or the sea, or the\nking's house;' as much as to say, in plainer language, whoever wants to\nflourish and become rich, let him follow the church, or go to sea,\nadopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king's service in his\nhousehold, for they say, 'Better a king's crumb than a lord's favour.'\nI say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should\nfollow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in the\nwars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in\nhis household, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great\ndistinction and fame. Eight days hence I will give you your full shares\nin money, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in the\nend. Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as\nI have laid it before you.\"",

My\ntwo brothers, moved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, so\nthat there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money,\nbesides three thousand, the value of the portion that fell to him which\nhe preferred to retain in land instead of selling it.

I changed my plans, joined him, served\nunder him in the campaigns he made, was present at the deaths of the\nCounts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famous\ncaptain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after my\narrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius\nV. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common\nenemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous\nisland of Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable\nand disastrous. It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of\nAustria, natural brother of our good king Don Philip, was coming as\ncommander-in-chief of the allied forces, and rumours were abroad of the\nvast warlike preparations which were being made, all which stirred my\nheart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which\nwas expected; and though I had reason to believe, and almost certain\npromises, that on the first opportunity that presented itself I should\nbe promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betake myself,\nas I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just\narrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian\nfleet, as he afterwards did at Messina.

The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found\nmyself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three\nlanterns. There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the\nwhole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and\njanizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be\nattacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, or\nshoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed,\nin so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered it\notherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on\nour side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God's\nwill and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment\nto chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is an\nisland near Navarino, and landing forces fortified the mouth of the\nharbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. On this expedition\nwas taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a son of the\nfamous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitan galley\ncalled the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that father\nof his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don \u00c1lvaro de\nBazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what took\nplace at the capture of the Prize.\nThe son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly,\nthat, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was\nbearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped\ntheir oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end\nof the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from\nbench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before\nhe had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so\ngreat, as I said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and the\nhatred with which they hated him.\nWe returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three,\nit became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom\nfrom the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to\nthe hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the\nworld, entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the\nloss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess,\nhe made peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than\nhe was), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta\nand the fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis.

At length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before\nwhich places there were seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers,\nand more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of\nAfrica, and in the train of all this great host such munitions and\nengines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they might\nhave covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth. The first\nto fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell,\nnot by any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could and\nshould have done, but because experiment proved how easily\nentrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used to\nbe found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none at two yards;\nand so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works so\nhigh that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as if\nfrom a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain\nthe defence.\nIt was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up\nin the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the\nlanding-place; but those who say so talk at random and with little\nknowledge of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there\nwere barely seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number,\nhowever resolute, sally out and hold their own against numbers like\nthose of the enemy? And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold\nthat is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined\nenemies in their own country? But many thought, and I thought so too,\nthat it was special favour and mercy which Heaven showed to Spain in\npermitting the destruction of that source and hiding place of mischief,\nthat devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, fruitlessly wasted\nthere to no other purpose save preserving the memory of its capture by\nthe invincible Charles V.; as if to make that eternal, as it is and\nwill be, these stones were needed to support it. The fort also fell;\nbut the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defended\nit fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed\nin twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand. Of three\nhundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear and\nmanifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily they\nhad defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or tower\nwhich was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don Juan\nZanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated upon\nterms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of the\nGoletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and took\nthe loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way to\nConstantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also took\nthe commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanese\ngentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these two\nfortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,\nknight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was\nshown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John Andrea\nDoria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by\nsome Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted\nhimself, and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a Moor to\nTabarca, a small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese\nemployed in the coral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carried\nit to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth\nof our Castilian proverb, that \"though the treason may please, the\ntraitor is hated;\" for they say he ordered those who brought him the\npresent to be hanged for not having brought him alive.",

Finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to\nConstantinople, and a few months later died my master, El Uchali,\notherwise Uchali Fartax, which means in Turkish \"the scabby renegade;\"\nfor that he was; it is the practice with the Turks to name people from\nsome defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being that there are\namong them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their\ndescent from the Ottoman house, and the others, as I have said, take\ntheir names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral\nqualities. This \"scabby one\" rowed at the oar as a slave of the Grand\nSignor's for fourteen years, and when over thirty-four years of age, in\nresentment at having been struck by a Turk while at the oar, turned\nrenegade and renounced his faith in order to be able to revenge\nhimself; and such was his valour that, without owing his advancement to\nthe base ways and means by which most favourites of the Grand Signor\nrise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and afterwards\ngeneral-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm. He was\na Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated his\nslaves with great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and after\nhis death they were divided, as he directed by his will, between the\nGrand Signor (who is heir of all who die and shares with the children\nof the deceased) and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetian\nrenegade who, when a cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken by\nUchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his most\nfavoured youths. He came to be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his\nname was Hassan Aga, and he grew very rich and became king of Algiers.",

To these ba\u00f1os, as I have\nsaid, some private individuals of the town are in the habit of bringing\ntheir captives, especially when they are to be ransomed; because there\nthey can keep them in safety and comfort until their ransom arrives.\nThe king's captives also, that are on ransom, do not go out to work\nwith the rest of the crew, unless when their ransom is delayed; for\nthen, to make them write for it more pressingly, they compel them to\nwork and go for wood, which is no light labour.\nI, however, was one of those on ransom, for when it was discovered that\nI was a captain, although I declared my scanty means and want of\nfortune, nothing could dissuade them from including me among the\ngentlemen and those waiting to be ransomed. They put a chain on me,\nmore as a mark of this than to keep me safe, and so I passed my life in\nthat ba\u00f1o with several other gentlemen and persons of quality marked\nout as held to ransom; but though at times, or rather almost always, we\nsuffered from hunger and scanty clothing, nothing distressed us so much\nas hearing and seeing at every turn the unexampled and unheard-of\ncruelties my master inflicted upon the Christians. Every day he hanged\na man, impaled one, cut off the ears of another; and all with so little\nprovocation, or so entirely without any, that the Turks acknowledged he\ndid it merely for the sake of doing it, and because he was by nature",

      "text": "To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by\nthe windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position;\nand these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than\nwindows, and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. It\nso happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison\nwith three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we\ncould leap with our chains, we being alone, for all the other\nChristians had gone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from\none of these little closed windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth\nattached to the end of it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving as\nif making signs to us to come and take it. We watched it, and one of\nthose who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether\nthey would let it drop, or what they would do, but as he did so the\nreed was raised and moved from side to side, as if they meant to say\n\"no\" by a shake of the head. The Christian came back, and it was again\nlowered, making the same movements as before. Another of my comrades\nwent, and with him the same happened as with the first, and then the\nthird went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.\nSeeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I came\nunder the reed it was dropped and fell inside the ba\u00f1o at my feet. I\nhastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this\nwere ten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors,\nand each worth ten reals of our money.\nIt is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not\nless than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could\nhave come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to\ndrop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was\nintended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the\nterrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out\nthat opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied\nthat it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this\nkindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams\nafter the fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and\ncrossing the arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window\na small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This\nsign led us to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the\nhouse, and that it was she who had been so good to us; but the\nwhiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made us\ndismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the Christian\nrenegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, and\ngladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation. In all\nour conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward\nour sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the\ncross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at least\nfifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or any",

      "text": "We made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before I\ndid; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it\nwas let drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns\nwith a paper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was\na large cross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned\nto the terrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I\nmade signs that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed.\nWe were all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place;\nand as none of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know\nwhat the paper contained, and still greater the difficulty of finding\nsomeone to read it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a\nnative of Murcia, who professed a very great friendship for me, and had\ngiven pledges that bound him to keep any secret I might entrust to him;\nfor it is the custom with some renegades, when they intend to return to\nChristian territory, to carry about them certificates from captives of\nmark testifying, in whatever form they can, that such and such a\nrenegade is a worthy man who has always shown kindness to Christians,\nand is anxious to escape on the first opportunity that may present\nitself. Some obtain these testimonials with good intentions, others put\nthem to a cunning use; for when they go to pillage on Christian\nterritory, if they chance to be cast away, or taken prisoners, they\nproduce their certificates and say that from these papers may be seen\nthe object they came for, which was to remain on Christian ground, and\nthat it was to this end they joined the Turks in their foray. In this\nway they escape the consequences of the first outburst and make their\npeace with the Church before it does them any harm, and then when they\nhave the chance they return to Barbary to become what they were before.\nOthers, however, there are who procure these papers and make use of\nthem honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This friend of mine, then,\nwas one of these renegades that I have described; he had certificates\nfrom all our comrades, in which we testified in his favour as strongly\nas we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they would have\nburned him alive.\nI knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak\nbut also write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, I\nasked him to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a\nhole in my cell. He opened it and remained some time examining it and\nmuttering to himself as he translated it. I asked him if he understood\nit, and he told me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him to\ntell me its meaning word for word, I must give him pen and ink that he\nmight do it more satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required,\nand he set about translating it bit by bit, and when he had done he\nsaid:\n\"All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and\nyou must bear in mind that when it says 'Lela Marien' it means 'Our\nLady the Virgin Mary.'\"\nWe read the paper and it ran thus:\n\"When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the\nChristian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about Lela\nMarien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,\nbut to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told me\nto go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great\nlove for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but\nexcept thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and\nbeautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst\ncontrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband\nthere, and if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien\nwill find me someone to marry me. I myself have written this: have a\ncare to whom thou givest it to read: trust no Moor, for they are all\nperfidious. I am greatly troubled on this account, for I would not have\nthee confide in anyone, because if my father knew it he would at once\nfling me down a well and cover me with stones. I will put a thread to\nthe reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou hast no one to write for\nthee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela Marien will make me\nunderstand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which I often kiss as\nthe captive bade me, protect thee.\"\nJudge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of\nthis paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegade\nperceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been in\nreality addressed to someone of us, and he begged us, if what he\nsuspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he would\nrisk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his\nbreast a metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the image\nrepresented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and\nfaithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we\nchose to reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means\nof her who had written that paper, he and all of us would obtain our\nliberty, and he himself obtain the object he so much desired, his\nrestoration to the bosom of the Holy Mother Church, from which by his\nown sin and ignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb. The\nrenegade said this with so many tears and such signs of repentance,\nthat with one consent we all agreed to tell him the whole truth of the\nmatter, and so we gave him a full account of all, without hiding\nanything from him. We pointed out to him the window at which the reed\nappeared, and he by that means took note of the house, and resolved to\nascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed also that it\nwould be advisable to answer the Moorish lady's letter, and the\nrenegade without a moment's delay took down the words I dictated to\nhim, which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing of\nimportance that took place in this affair has escaped my memory, or\never will while life lasts. This, then, was the answer returned to the\nMoorish lady:\n\"The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is the\ntrue mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land\nof the Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she be\npleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee,\nfor she will, such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of all\nthese Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that we can for\nthee, even to death. Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou\ndost mean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah has\ngiven us a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well,\nas thou mayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst\ninform us of all thou wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou\ndost reach the land of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee\nmy promise upon it as a good Christian; and know that the Christians\nkeep their promises better than the Moors. Allah and Marien his mother\nwatch over thee, my Lady.\"\nThe paper being written and folded I waited two days until the ba\u00f1o was\nempty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the\nterrace to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long\nin making its appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could not\ndistinguish who put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the\nthread, but it was already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the\npaper; and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance\nwith the white flag of peace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and I\npicked it up, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver coins of all\nsorts, more than fifty crowns, which fifty times more strengthened our\njoy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty. That very night our\nrenegade returned and said he had learned that the Moor we had been\ntold of lived in that house, that his name was Hadji Morato, that he\nwas enormously rich, that he had one only daughter the heiress of all\nhis wealth, and that it was the general opinion throughout the city\nthat she was the most beautiful woman in Barbary, and that several of\nthe viceroys who came there had sought her for a wife, but that she had\nbeen always unwilling to marry; and he had learned, moreover, that she\nhad a Christian slave who was now dead; all which agreed with the\ncontents of the paper. We immediately took counsel with the renegade as\nto what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off the\nMoorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in the end it\nwas agreed that for the present we should wait for a second\ncommunication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who now\ndesires to be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no one\nelse could find a way out of all these difficulties. When we had\ndecided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he would\nlose his life or restore us to liberty. For four days the ba\u00f1o was\nfilled with people, for which reason the reed delayed its appearance\nfor four days, but at the end of that time, when the ba\u00f1o was, as it\ngenerally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it\npromised a happy birth. Reed and cloth came down to me, and I found\nanother paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. The\nrenegade was present, and in our cell we gave him the paper to read,\nwhich was to this effect:\n\"I cannot think of a plan, se\u00f1or, for our going to Spain, nor has Lela\nMarien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done is\nfor me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With it\nransom yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of\nthe Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others;\nand he will find me in my father's garden, which is at the Babazon gate\nnear the seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and\nmy servants. You can carry me away from there by night without any\ndanger, and bring me to the vessel. And remember thou art to be my\nhusband, else I will pray to Marien to punish thee. If thou canst not\ntrust anyone to go for the vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I\nknow thou wilt return more surely than any other, as thou art a\ngentleman and a Christian. Endeavour to make thyself acquainted with\nthe garden; and when I see thee walking yonder I shall know that the\nba\u00f1o is empty and I will give thee abundance of money. Allah protect\nthee, se\u00f1or.\"",

      "text": "These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearing\nthem, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and\npromised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made\nthe same offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he\nwould not on any account consent to one being set free before all went\ntogether, as experience had taught him how ill those who have been set\nfree keep promises which they made in captivity; for captives of\ndistinction frequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of\none who was to go to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him to\narm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed him, but who\nnever came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again\nefface from the memory all the obligations in the world. And to prove\nthe truth of what he said, he told us briefly what had happened to a\ncertain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangest\ncase that had ever occurred even there, where astonishing and\nmarvellous things are happening every instant. In short, he ended by\nsaying that what could and ought to be done was to give the money\nintended for the ransom of one of us Christians to him, so that he\nmight with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the pretence of\nbecoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast; and when\nmaster of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some way of\ngetting us all out of the ba\u00f1o and putting us on board; especially if\nthe Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, because\nonce free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark\neven in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not\nallow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel\nfor going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone\nwho buys a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it\nfor the purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however he\ncould get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him\nin the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and\nunder cover of this he could become master of the vessel, in which case\nhe looked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though to me and my\ncomrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel,\nas the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing\nthat if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us in\ndanger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with\nZoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own. We therefore\nresolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade's;\nand at the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her that\nwe would do all she recommended, for she had given as good advice as if\nLela Marien had delivered it, and that it depended on her alone whether\nwe were to defer the business or put it in execution at once. I renewed\nmy promise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the ba\u00f1o\nchanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed\nand cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that\nthe next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to her father's\ngarden, but that before she went she would give us more money; and if\nit were not enough we were to let her know, as she would give us as\nmuch as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss it, and\nbesides she kept all the keys.\nWe at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and\nwith eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian\nmerchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had me\nreleased on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship\nfrom Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money at\nonce it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been\nfor a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own\nadvantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal\nwith that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The\nThursday before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the\ngarden she gave us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of her\ndeparture, begging me, if I were ransomed, to find out her father's\ngarden at once, and by all means to seek an opportunity of going there\nto see her. I answered in a few words that I would do so, and that she\nmust remember to commend us to Lela Marien with all the prayers the\ncaptive had taught her. This having been done, steps were taken to\nransom our three comrades, so as to enable them to quit the ba\u00f1o, and\nlest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though the money was\nforthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the devil\nshould prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; for\nthough their position might be sufficient to relieve me from this\napprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the\nmatter; and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handing\nover all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety and\nconfidence give security; without, however, confiding our arrangement\nand secret to him, which might have been dangerous.\nc40e.jpg (34K)",

      "text": "Before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an\nexcellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make\nthe transaction safe and lend a colour to it, he thought it well to\nmake, as he did, a voyage to a place called Shershel, twenty leagues\nfrom Algiers on the Oran side, where there is an extensive trade in\ndried figs. Two or three times he made this voyage in company with the\nTagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins in\nBarbary, and those of Granada Mud\u00e9jares; but in the Kingdom of Fez they\ncall the Mud\u00e9jares Elches, and they are the people the king chiefly\nemploys in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel he\nanchored in a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden\nwhere Zoraida was waiting; and there the renegade, together with the\ntwo Moorish lads that rowed, used purposely to station himself, either\ngoing through his prayers, or else practising as a part what he meant\nto perform in earnest. And thus he would go to Zoraida's garden and ask\nfor fruit, which her father gave him, not knowing him; but though, as\nhe afterwards told me, he sought to speak to Zoraida, and tell her who\nhe was, and that by my orders he was to take her to the land of the\nChristians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he had never\nbeen able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to be\nseen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: with\nChristian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and\ncommunication, even more than might be considered proper. But for my\npart I should have been sorry if he had spoken to her, for perhaps it\nmight have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades. But\nGod, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for our\nrenegade's well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how safely he could go to\nShershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he liked, and\nthat the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now I was\nransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to\nlook out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above\nthose who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday,\nwhich he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to twelve\nSpaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the\ncity; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because\nthere were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the\nrowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that\ntheir master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order\nto finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said\nnothing more than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come\nout stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato's garden, waiting\nfor me there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately,\nwith orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not\nto say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that\nspot.",

      "text": "This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step\nhad to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that\nshe might be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise\nif we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the\nChristians' vessel could have returned. I determined, therefore, to go\nto the garden and try if I could speak to her; and the day before my\ndeparture I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs. The first\nperson I met was her father, who addressed me in the language that all\nover Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captives\nand Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other\nnation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all\nunderstand one another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked me\nwhat I wanted in his garden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that I\nwas a slave of the Arnaut Mami (for I knew as a certainty that he was a\nvery great friend of his), and that I wanted some herbs to make a\nsalad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, and what my\nmaster demanded for me. While these questions and answers were\nproceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time\nbefore, came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are\nby no means particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians,\nor, as I have said before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming\nto where her father stood with me; moreover her father, seeing her\napproaching slowly, called to her to come. It would be beyond my power\nnow to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred air, the\nbrilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented herself before\nmy eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from\nher fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head.\nOn her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (for\nso bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set\nwith so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued\nthem at ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists were\nworth as much more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the\nhighest display and adornment of the Moorish women is decking\nthemselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there are\ntherefore more among the Moors than among any other people. Zoraida's\nfather had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and the\npurest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundred\nthousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, was\nmistress of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been\nbeautiful or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may be\nimagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for,\nas everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and its\nseasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturally\nthe emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed more\nfrequently they totally destroy it. In a word she presented herself\nbefore me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremely\nbeautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object I\nhad ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt\nas though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me\nrelief and happiness.\nAs she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a\ncaptive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come\nfor salad.\nShe took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have\nspoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not\nransomed.\nI answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might\nbe seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand\nfive hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, \"Hadst thou been my\nfather's, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for\ntwice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and\nmake yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.\"\n\"That may be, lady,\" said I; \"but indeed I dealt truthfully with my\nmaster, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.\"\n\"And when dost thou go?\" said Zoraida.\n\"To-morrow, I think,\" said I, \"for there is a vessel here from France\nwhich sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\"\n\"Would it not be better,\" said Zoraida, \"to wait for the arrival of\nships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not\nyour friends?\"\n\"No,\" said I; \"though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now\ncoming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it\nis more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to\nreturn to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not\nallow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if\nit be delayed.\"\n\"No doubt thou art married in thine own country,\" said Zoraida, \"and\nfor that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.\"\n\"I am not married,\" I replied, \"but I have given my promise to marry on\nmy arrival there.\"\n\"And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?\" said Zoraida.\n\"So beautiful,\" said I, \"that, to describe her worthily and tell thee\nthe truth, she is very like thee.\"\nAt this her father laughed very heartily and said, \"By Allah,\nChristian, she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who\nis the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well\nand thou wilt see I am telling the truth.\"\nZoraida's father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of\nthese words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language,\nthat, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more\nby signs than by words.\nWhile we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running\nup, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the\ngarden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The\nold man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to\nspeak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the\nsoldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are\nunder their power that they treat them worse than if they were their\nslaves. Her father said to Zoraida, \"Daughter, retire into the house\nand shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou,\nChristian, pick thy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safe\nto thy own country.\"\nI bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone with\nZoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade\nher; but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden,\nturning to me with her eyes full of tears she said, \"Tameji, cristiano,\ntameji?\" that is to say, \"Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?\"\nI made answer, \"Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on\nthe watch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest\nus; for most surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.\"\nThis I said in such a way that she understood perfectly all that passed\nbetween us, and throwing her arm round my neck she began with feeble\nsteps to move towards the house; but as fate would have it (and it\nmight have been very unfortunate if Heaven had not otherwise ordered\nit), just as we were moving on in the manner and position I have\ndescribed, with her arm round my neck, her father, as he returned after\nhaving sent away the Turks, saw how we were walking and we perceived\nthat he saw us; but Zoraida, ready and quickwitted, took care not to\nremove her arm from my neck, but on the contrary drew closer to me and\nlaid her head on my breast, bending her knees a little and showing all\nthe signs and tokens of fainting, while I at the same time made it seem\nas though I were supporting her against my will. Her father came\nrunning up to where we were, and seeing his daughter in this state\nasked what was the matter with her; she, however, giving no answer, he\nsaid, \"No doubt she has fainted in alarm at the entrance of those\ndogs,\" and taking her from mine he drew her to his own breast, while\nshe sighing, her eyes still wet with tears, said again, \"Ameji,\ncristiano, ameji\"\u2014\"Go, Christian, go.\" To this her father replied,",

The time passed at length, and the appointed day we so longed\nfor arrived; and, all following out the arrangement and plan which,\nafter careful consideration and many a long discussion, we had decided\nupon, we succeeded as fully as we could have wished; for on the Friday\nfollowing the day upon which I spoke to Zoraida in the garden, the\nrenegade anchored his vessel at nightfall almost opposite the spot\nwhere she was. The Christians who were to row were ready and in hiding\nin different places round about, all waiting for me, anxious and\nelated, and eager to attack the vessel they had before their eyes; for\nthey did not know the renegade's plan, but expected that they were to\ngain their liberty by force of arms and by killing the Moors who were\non board the vessel.

We told him why we hesitated, but he said it was of more\nimportance first to secure the vessel, which could be done with the\ngreatest ease and without any danger, and then we could go for Zoraida.\nWe all approved of what he said, and so without further delay, guided\nby him we made for the vessel, and he leaping on board first, drew his\ncutlass and said in Morisco, \"Let no one stir from this if he does not\nwant it to cost him his life.\" By this almost all the Christians were\non board, and the Moors, who were fainthearted, hearing their captain\nspeak in this way, were cowed, and without any one of them taking to\nhis arms (and indeed they had few or hardly any) they submitted without\nsaying a word to be bound by the Christians, who quickly secured them,",

The lovely\nZoraida was watching for us at a window, and as soon as she perceived\nthat there were people there, she asked in a low voice if we were\n\"Nizarani,\" as much as to say or ask if we were Christians. I answered\nthat we were, and begged her to come down.

Unfortunately her father\nawoke while this was going on, and hearing a noise in the garden, came\nto the window, and at once perceiving that all those who were there\nwere Christians, raising a prodigiously loud outcry, he began to call\nout in Arabic, \"Christians, Christians! thieves, thieves!\" by which\ncries we were all thrown into the greatest fear and embarrassment; but\nthe renegade seeing the danger we were in and how important it was for\nhim to effect his purpose before we were heard, mounted with the utmost\nquickness to where Hadji Morato was, and with him went some of our\nparty; I, however, did not dare to leave Zoraida, who had fallen almost\nfainting in my arms. To be brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so\npromptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with\nhis hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which prevented him\nfrom uttering a word, warning him at the same time that to attempt to\nspeak would cost him his life. When his daughter caught sight of him\nshe covered her eyes so as not to see him, and her father was\nhorror-stricken, not knowing how willingly she had placed herself in\nour hands. But it was now most essential for us to be on the move, and\ncarefully and quickly we regained the vessel, where those who had\nremained on board were waiting for us in apprehension of some mishap\nhaving befallen us. It was barely two hours after night set in when we\nwere all on board the vessel, where the cords were removed from the\nhands of Zoraida's father, and the napkin from his mouth; but the\nrenegade once more told him not to utter a word, or they would take his\nlife. He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and\nstill more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that\nshe lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any\nreluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry into\neffect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.\nFinding herself now on board, and that we were about to give way with",

They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as\nmany as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their\nmatches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we\nwere, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us\nthat this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an\nanswer.

In short\nwe went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained all\nthey wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, as if\nthey had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took even\nthe anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her did\nnot distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her of\nher rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the most\nprecious jewel that she valued more than all.

      "text": "It may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving\nus two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know\nnot what compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave\nher some forty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take from\nher those same garments which she has on now. We got into the boat,\nreturning them thanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves\ngrateful rather than indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for the\nstraits; we, without looking to any compass save the land we had before\nus, set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so\nnear that we might easily, we thought, land before the night was far\nadvanced. But as the moon did not show that night, and the sky was\nclouded, and as we knew not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us\na prudent thing to make for the shore, as several of us advised, saying\nwe ought to run ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far from\nany habitation, for in this way we should be relieved from the\napprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the Tetuan\ncorsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall and are on the Spanish coast\nby daybreak, where they commonly take some prize, and then go home to\nsleep in their own houses. But of the conflicting counsels the one\nwhich was adopted was that we should approach gradually, and land where\nwe could if the sea were calm enough to permit us. This was done, and a\nlittle before midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and lofty\nmountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on\nwhich to land conveniently. We ran our boat up on the sand, and all\nsprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfaction\nreturned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparable goodness to us\non our voyage. We took out of the boat the provisions it contained, and\ndrew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up the mountain,\nfor even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuade\nourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.\nThe dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; we\ncompleted the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation\nor any shepherds' huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we\nmight, neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we\nperceive. However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not\nbut be that ere long we must see someone who could tell us where we\nwere. But what distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over\nthat rough ground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she\nwas more wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she\nwould never again allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very\npatiently and cheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gone\nrather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell\nfell on our ears, a clear proof that there were flocks hard by, and\nlooking about carefully to see if any were within view, we observed a\nyoung shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his\nknife at the foot of a cork tree. We called to him, and he, raising his\nhead, sprang nimbly to his feet, for, as we afterwards learned, the\nfirst who presented themselves to his sight were the renegade and\nZoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he imagined that all the\nMoors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging with marvellous swiftness\ninto the thicket in front of him, he began to raise a prodigious\noutcry, exclaiming, \"The Moors\u2014the Moors have landed! To arms, to\narms!\" We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not knowing\nwhat to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raise\nthe country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to see\nwhat was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his\nTurkish garments and put on a captive's jacket or coat which one of our\nparty gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and\nso commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw\nthe shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be\ndown upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not\npassed when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we\nperceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a\nhand-gallop. As soon as we saw them we stood still, waiting for them;\nbut as they came close and, instead of the Moors they were in quest of,\nsaw a set of poor Christians, they were taken aback, and one of them\nasked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd having\nraised the call to arms. I said \"Yes,\" and as I was about to explain to\nhim what had occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one of the\nChristians of our party recognised the horseman who had put the\nquestion to us, and before I could say anything more he exclaimed:\n\"Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if\nI do not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga\nunless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to\nrecollect that you, se\u00f1or, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante,\nmy uncle.\"\nThe Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman\nthrew himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:\n\"Nephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have I\nmourned thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin\nthat are still alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that\nthey may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee. We knew long since that\nthou wert in Algiers, and from the appearance of thy garments and those\nof all this company, I conclude that ye have had a miraculous\nrestoration to liberty.\"\n\"It is true,\" replied the young man, \"and by-and-by we will tell you\nall.\"\nAs soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives,\nthey dismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us to\nthe city of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Some\nof them went to bring the boat to the city, we having told them where\nwe had left it; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed\non the horse of the young man's uncle. The whole town came out to meet\nus, for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who had\ngone on in advance. They were not astonished to see liberated captives\nor captive Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see both\none and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida,\nwhich was just then heightened, as well by the exertion of travelling\nas by joy at finding herself on Christian soil, and relieved of all\nfear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her face,\nthat unless my affection for her were deceiving me, I would venture to\nsay that there was not a more beautiful creature in the world\u2014at least,\nthat I had ever seen. We went straight to the church to return thanks\nto God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it she\nsaid there were faces there like Lela Marien's. We told her they were\nher images; and as well as he could the renegade explained to her what\nthey meant, that she might adore them as if each of them were the very\nsame Lela Marien that had spoken to her; and she, having great\nintelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all he\nsaid to her about them. Thence they took us away and distributed us all\nin different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, and\nmyself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of his\nparents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated us\nwith as much kindness as they did their own son.",

He led by\nthe hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen\nyears of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so\ngraceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made her\nappearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida,\nwho were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like\nthat of this maiden's would have been hard to find. Don Quixote was\npresent at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soon\nas he saw him he said, \"Your worship may with confidence enter and take\nyour ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty and\npoor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannot\nmake room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters have\nbeauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worship\nhave in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throw\nthemselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rend\nthemselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to give\nher a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, for\nhere you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worship\nbrings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme excellence,\nand beauty in its highest perfection.\"\nThe Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote,\nwhom he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure\nthan by his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a\nfresh surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and\nZoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the\nyoung lady, had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando,\nCardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible\nand polished style. In short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of\nbewilderment, as well with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair\nladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole\nhe could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; but\nwith the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at his\nwits' end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and the\naccommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had been\nbefore settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that has\nbeen already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if to\nguard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow his\ndaughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did\nvery willingly; and with part of the host's narrow bed and half of what\nthe Judge had brought with him, they made a more comfortable\narrangement for the night than they had expected.",

The curate, however, only\nwent so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were\nin the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the\nfair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what\nbecame of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to\nFrance by the Frenchmen.",

The words the brothers exchanged,\nthe emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less\nput down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events of\ntheir lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its\nstrength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at\nher disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair\nChristian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye. And\nthere was Don Quixote observing all these strange proceedings\nattentively without uttering a word, and attributing the whole to\nchimeras of knight-errantry. Then they agreed that the captain and\nZoraida should return with his brother to Seville, and send news to his\nfather of his having been delivered and found, so as to enable him to\ncome and be present at the marriage and baptism of Zoraida, for it was\nimpossible for the Judge to put off his journey, as he was informed\nthat in a month from that time the fleet was to sail from Seville for\nNew Spain, and to miss the passage would have been a great\ninconvenience to him.

On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear\nher, winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to\nher ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone\nelse, and said:\n\"This singer, dear se\u00f1ora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of\ntwo villages, who lives opposite my father's house at Madrid; and\nthough my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter,\nand lattice-work in summer, in some way\u2014I know not how\u2014this gentleman,\nwho was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, I\ncannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know it\nfrom the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears that I was\nforced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing what it\nwas he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was to link\none hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though I\nshould have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I\nknew not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing\nhim no favour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, to\nraise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly,\nat which he would show such delight that he seemed as if he were going\nmad. Meanwhile the time for my father's departure arrived, which he\nbecame aware of, but not from me, for I had never been able to tell him\nof it. He fell sick, of grief I believe, and so the day we were going\naway I could not see him to take farewell of him, were it only with the\neyes. But after we had been two days on the road, on entering the\nposada of a village a day's journey from this, I saw him at the inn\ndoor in the dress of a muleteer, and so well disguised, that if I did\nnot carry his image graven on my heart it would have been impossible\nfor me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I was surprised, and glad;\nhe watched me, unsuspected by my father, from whom he always hides\nhimself when he crosses my path on the road, or in the posadas where we\nhalt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that for love of me he\nmakes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready to die of\nsorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know not with\nwhat object he has come; or how he could have got away from his father,\nwho loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and because he\ndeserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And moreover, I can\ntell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I have heard\nthem say he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time I\nsee him or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest my\nfather should recognise him and come to know of our loves. I have never\nspoken a word to him in my life; and for all that I love him so that I\ncould not live without him. This, dear se\u00f1ora, is all I have to tell\nyou about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from\nit alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of\nhearts and towns, as I told you already.\"",

Forgive me, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not,\nby any further declaration of your passion, compel me to show myself\nmore ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that\nthere is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided\nit be not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that\nsweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that\nyou require of me a lock of Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or\neven the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.\"\n\"My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,\" said Maritornes\nat this.\n\"What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?\" replied Don\nQuixote.\n\"Only one of your fair hands,\" said Maritornes, \"to enable her to vent\nover it the great passion, passion which has brought her to this\nloophole, so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father\nhad heard her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.\"\n\"I should like to see that tried,\" said Don Quixote; \"but he had better\nbeware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end\nthat ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender\nlimbs of a love-stricken daughter.\"\nMaritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had\nasked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole\nand went into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza's\nass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had\nplanted himself standing on Rocinante's saddle in order to reach the\ngrated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving\nher his hand, he said, \"Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of\nthe evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand\nof woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of\nmy entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that\nyou may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the\nmuscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer\nwhat must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand.\"\n\"That we shall see presently,\" said Maritornes, and making a running\nknot on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from\nthe hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the\nstraw-loft.\nDon Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,\n\"Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it\nnot so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution\nhas given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a\npart; remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so\ncruelly.\"\nBut there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote's, for\nas soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to\ndie with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was",

Finding himself fast, then,\nand that the ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this was\ndone by enchantment, as on the former occasion when in that same castle\nthat enchanted Moor of a carrier had belaboured him; and he cursed in\nhis heart his own want of sense and judgment in venturing to enter the\ncastle again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a\nsettled point with knights-errant that when they have tried an\nadventure, and have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is not\nreserved for them but for others, and that therefore they need not try\nit again. Nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release\nhimself, but it had been made so fast that all his efforts were in\nvain.

They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn,\nwhich was still shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he\nwas, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and\nimperious tone, \"Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no\nright to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that\nthey who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit of\nthrowing open the fortress until the sun's rays are spread over the\nwhole surface of the earth.

If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us;\nwe are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we\nare in haste.\"\n\"Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?\" said Don\nQuixote.\n\"I don't know what you look like,\" replied the other; \"but I know that\nyou are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.\"\n\"A castle it is,\" returned Don Quixote, \"nay, more, one of the best in\nthis whole province, and it has within it people who have had the\nsceptre in the hand and the crown on the head.\"\n\"It would be better if it were the other way,\" said the traveller, \"the\nsceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, maybe there\nis within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to\nhave those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as\nthis, and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people\nentitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.\"\n\"You know but little of the world,\" returned Don Quixote, \"since you\nare ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.\"\nBut the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with\nDon Quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that\nthe host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got\nup to ask who knocked.

Don Quixote, when he\nsaw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or\nreplied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation\nand wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry\nthat it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in\nanother enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to\ninvolve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he\nwas pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have\nmade them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that\nit would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until\nhe had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to\nhold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the\nproceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they\nwere seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought\nof anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him.\nThe man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, \"It becomes you well\nindeed, Se\u00f1or Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed\nin which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared\nyou.\"\nThe youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held\nhim, but presently recognised him as one of his father's servants, at\nwhich he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or\nutter a word; while the servant went on to say, \"There is nothing for\nit now, Se\u00f1or Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless\nit is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure\nfor the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the\ngrief he is in at your absence.\"\n\"But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this\ndress?\" said Don Luis.\n\"It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,\" answered the\nservant, \"that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw\nyour father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his\nservants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better\npleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able\nto restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.\"\n\"That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,\" returned Don Luis.\n\"What can you please or heaven order,\" said the other, \"except to agree\nto go back? Anything else is impossible.\"\nAll this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at\nwhose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken\nplace to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time\ndressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth\nas \"Don,\" and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to\nhis father, which the youth was unwilling to do.

The\nbarber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made\nin the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that\neveryone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel\nmeant. \"Here, in the name of the king and justice!\" he cried, \"this\nthief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my\nproperty.\"\n\"You lie,\" said Sancho, \"I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my\nmaster Don Quixote won these spoils.\"\nDon Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his\nsquire's stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time\nforth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub\nhim a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling\nsure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.\nIn the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,\n\"Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death,\nand I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass\nin the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not\nfit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day\nI was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin,\nnever yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.\"\nAt this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and\ninterposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the\npack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was\nestablished, and said, \"Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly\nthe error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin\nwhich was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him\nin fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful\npossession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may\ntell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to\nstrip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon's steed, and with\nit adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having\nbeen changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no\nexplanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take\nplace in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my\nson, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.\"\n\"Egad, master,\" said Sancho, \"if we have no other proof of our case\nthan what your worship puts forward, Mambrino's helmet is just as much\na basin as this good fellow's caparison is a pack-saddle.\"\n\"Do as I bid thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"it cannot be that everything in\nthis castle goes by enchantment.\"\nSancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him,\nand when Don Quixote saw it, he took hold of it and said:\n\"Your worships may see with what a face this squire can assert that\nthis is a basin and not the helmet I told you of; and I swear by the\norder of chivalry I profess, that this helmet is the identical one I\ntook from him, without anything added to or taken from it.\"\n\"There is no doubt of that,\" said Sancho, \"for from the time my master\nwon it until now he has only fought one battle in it, when he let loose\nthose unlucky men in chains; and if it had not been for this\nbasin-helmet he would not have come off over well that time, for there\nwas plenty of stone-throwing in that affair.\"",

      "text": "\"What do you think now, gentlemen,\" said the barber, \"of what these\ngentles say, when they want to make out that this is a helmet?\"\n\"And whoever says the contrary,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will let him know\nhe lies if he is a knight, and if he is a squire that he lies again a\nthousand times.\"\nOur own barber, who was present at all this, and understood Don\nQuixote's humour so thoroughly, took it into his head to back up his\ndelusion and carry on the joke for the general amusement; so addressing\nthe other barber he said:\n\"Se\u00f1or barber, or whatever you are, you must know that I belong to your\nprofession too, and have had a licence to practise for more than twenty\nyears, and I know the implements of the barber craft, every one of\nthem, perfectly well; and I was likewise a soldier for some time in the\ndays of my youth, and I know also what a helmet is, and a morion, and a\nheadpiece with a visor, and other things pertaining to soldiering, I\nmeant to say to soldiers' arms; and I say\u2014saving better opinions and\nalways with submission to sounder judgments\u2014that this piece we have now\nbefore us, which this worthy gentleman has in his hands, not only is no\nbarber's basin, but is as far from being one as white is from black,\nand truth from falsehood; I say, moreover, that this, although it is a\nhelmet, is not a complete helmet.\"\n\"Certainly not,\" said Don Quixote, \"for half of it is wanting, that is\nto say the beaver.\"\n\"It is quite true,\" said the curate, who saw the object of his friend\nthe barber; and Cardenio, Don Fernando and his companions agreed with\nhim, and even the Judge, if his thoughts had not been so full of Don\nLuis's affair, would have helped to carry on the joke; but he was so\ntaken up with the serious matters he had on his mind that he paid\nlittle or no attention to these facetious proceedings.\n\"God bless me!\" exclaimed their butt the barber at this; \"is it\npossible that such an honourable company can say that this is not a\nbasin but a helmet? Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole\nuniversity, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a\nhelmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this\ngentleman has said.\"\n\"To me it looks like a pack-saddle,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I have\nalready said that with that question I do not concern myself.\"\n\"As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,\" said the curate, \"it is\nonly for Se\u00f1or Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all\nthese gentlemen and I bow to his authority.\"\n\"By God, gentlemen,\" said Don Quixote, \"so many strange things have\nhappened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have\nsojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively\nin reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my\nbelief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The\nfirst time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble,\nnor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night\nI was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing\nhow or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward\nto give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash\ndecision. As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a\nhelmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whether\nthis is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a\npositive opinion, but will leave it to your worships' better judgment.\nPerhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of\nthis place have nothing to do with you, and your faculties are\nunfettered, and you can see things in this castle as they really and\ntruly are, and not as they appear to me.\"\n\"There can be no question,\" said Don Fernando on this, \"but that Se\u00f1or\nDon Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision\nof this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take\nthe votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly\nand fully.\"\nTo those who were in on the secret of Don Quixote's humour all this\nafforded great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it\nseemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four\nservants of Don Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three\nother travellers who had by chance come to the inn, and had the\nappearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were;\nbut the one who above all was at his wits' end was the barber whose\nbasin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino's\nhelmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to\nbecome a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to see Don Fernando\ngoing from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to them\nto give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there\nhad been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after\nhe had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud,\n\"The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a number\nof opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what I\ndesire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this\nis the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, of\na thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your\nass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and\nproved your case very badly.\"\n\"May I never share heaven,\" said the poor barber, \"if your worships are\nnot all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to\nme a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, 'laws go,'\u2014I say no more;\nand indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.\"\nThe simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the\nabsurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:\n\"There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to\nhim, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.\"\nBut said one of the four servants, \"Unless, indeed, this is a\ndeliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so\nintelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare\nand assert that this is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as\nI perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to the\nconclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so\nopposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself; for I swear\nby\"\u2014and here he rapped out a round oath\u2014\"all the people in the world\nwill not make me believe that this is not a barber's basin and that a\njackass's pack-saddle.\"\n\"It might easily be a she-ass's,\" observed the curate.\n\"It is all the same,\" said the servant; \"that is not the point; but\nwhether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.\"\nOn hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood,\nwho had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to\nrestrain his anger and impatience, exclaimed, \"It is a pack-saddle as\nsure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will say\nanything else must be drunk.\"\n\"You lie like a rascally clown,\" returned Don Quixote; and lifting his\npike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow\nat his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have\nstretched him at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against\nthe ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade\nassaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood.\nThe landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff\nof office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of his\ncomrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him, lest he should\nescape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turned\nupside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the\nsame; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luis\ncried out to his servants to leave him alone and go and help Don\nQuixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were supporting him; the\ncurate was shouting at the top of his voice, the landlady was\nscreaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorothea\nwas aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Do\u00f1a Clara in a faint. The\nbarber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis gave\none of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him\nfrom escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took\nhis part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was\nbelabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling\nfor help for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing\nbut cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps,\nsword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the\nmidst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don\nQuixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thick\nof the discord of Agramante's camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn\nlike thunder, he cried out:\n\"Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to\nme as they value their lives!\"\nAll paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, \"Did I not tell\nyou, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of\ndevils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with\nyour own eyes how the discord of Agramante's camp has come hither, and\nbeen transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for\nthe sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for\nthe helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then,\nyou, Se\u00f1or Judge, and you, se\u00f1or curate; let the one represent King\nAgramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by\nGod Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as\nwe are should slay one another for such trifling cause.\" The officers,\nwho did not understand Don Quixote's mode of speaking, and found\nthemselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their\ncompanions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both\nhis beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho\nlike a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master; while the\nfour servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they\ngained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon it that they\nmust punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a\ndisturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the\npresent; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment,\nand the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote's\nimagination.",

      "text": "All having been now pacified and made friends by the persuasion of the\nJudge and the curate, the servants of Don Luis began again to urge him\nto return with them at once; and while he was discussing the matter\nwith them, the Judge took counsel with Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the\ncurate as to what he ought to do in the case, telling them how it\nstood, and what Don Luis had said to him. It was agreed at length that\nDon Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that\nit was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia,\nwhere he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his\nquality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the\ndetermination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father at\npresent, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank of Don\nFernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it\nbetween themselves that three of them should return to tell his father\nhow matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don\nLuis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father's\norders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of\nKing Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the\nenemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made\na fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved\nthem all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand\nonce more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.\nIt came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the\nrank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the\ncontest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely\nto get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been\nthrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some\nwarrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one\nagainst Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be\narrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very\ngood reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to\nsatisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote's features corresponded; and\ntaking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search\nof, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick\nreader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and\nwent on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and\ndiscovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As\nsoon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the\nwarrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the\ncollar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted\naloud, \"Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it\nin earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be\narrested.\"\nThe curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was\ntrue, and that it agreed with Don Quixote's appearance, who, on his\npart, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown,\nworked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking\nwith rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all\nhis might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have\nyielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord,\nwho had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aid\nthem. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh\nquarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately\ncaught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and all\npresent for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, \"By\nthe Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments\nof this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!\"\nDon Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual\ncontentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the\ncoat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this,\nhowever, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call\non them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as was\nrequired for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on\nwhose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the\ncapture of this robber and footpad of the highways.\nDon Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly,",

Infamous\nbeings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven\nshould not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry,\nor show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to\nrespect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant!

In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the\nquestion by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not\nperfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they\nchanged the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to\nMambrino's helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote's\nknowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a\nfull receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or\nthenceforth for evermore, amen. These two disputes, which were the most\nimportant and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants\nof Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was\nleft to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him; and\ngood luck and better fortune, having already begun to solve\ndifficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and\nwarriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything to\na happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which\ngave Do\u00f1a Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her\nface just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she\ndid not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing\nwhy, as she watched and studied the various countenances, but\nparticularly her Spaniard's, whom she followed with her eyes and clung\nto with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the\nbarber had not escaped the landlord's notice, and he demanded Don\nQuixote's reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his\nwine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante\nnor Sancho's ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the\nvery last farthing. The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando\npaid; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score;\nand all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded\none of the discord of Agramante's camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the\npeace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it was\nthe universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and\neloquence of the curate, and to the unexampled generosity of Don\nFernando.\nFinding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as\nwell as his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to\ncontinue the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great\nadventure for which he had been called and chosen; and with this high\nresolve he went and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not\nallow him to utter a word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose,\nand said, \"It is a common proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence is the\nmother of good fortune,' and experience has often shown in important\naffairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case\nto a successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself\nmore plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall the\ndevices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to\ndefend himself. All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it\nseems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is\nuseless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out\nsome day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned\nby means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to destroy him,\nand if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himself\nin some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which all my efforts\nand the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little? Therefore,\nlady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity, and let\nus depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only\nkept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in\nencountering your adversary.\"\nDon Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply\nof the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style\nadapted to Don Quixote's own, replied to him in these words, \"I give\nyou thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to\nwhom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy,\ndisplay to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your\nwishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are\nwomen in this world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be\nforthwith, for I have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in\naccordance with your good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to\nyou the defence of her person, and placed in your hands the recovery of\nher dominions, must not think of offering opposition to that which your\nwisdom may ordain.\"\n\"On, then, in God's name,\" said Don Quixote; \"for, when a lady humbles\nherself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and\nplacing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for\nthe common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my\neagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell\nseen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and\nget ready thy ass and the queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the\ncastellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.\"\nSancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, \"Ah!\nmaster, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears\nof, begging all good bodies' pardon.\"\n\"What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the\nworld, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"If your worship is angry,\" replied Sancho, \"I will hold my tongue and\nleave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a good\nservant should tell his master.\"\n\"Say what thou wilt,\" returned Don Quixote, \"provided thy words be not\nmeant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving\nlike thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.\"\n\"It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,\" said Sancho,\n\"but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who calls\nherself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my\nmother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses\nwith one that is here every instant and behind every door.\"\nDorothea turned red at Sancho's words, for the truth was that her\nhusband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not\nlooking, gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned,\nand Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a\ncourtesan than a queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable\nor not caring to answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued,\n\"This I say, se\u00f1or, because, if after we have travelled roads and\nhighways, and passed bad nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying\nhimself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours, there is no\nneed for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the\nass, or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for us to stay\nquiet, and let every jade mind her spinning, and let us go to dinner.\"\nGood God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the\naudacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voice\ninarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed\nliving fire, he exclaimed, \"Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and\nignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer!\nHast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these\nillustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless\nthoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou born\nmonster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,\ninventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect\ndue to royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me under\npain of my wrath;\" and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out his\ncheeks, gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his\nright foot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his\nheart; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and\nterrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that\ninstant and swallowed him, and his only thought was to turn round and\nmake his escape from the angry presence of his master.\nBut the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don\nQuixote's humour, said, to mollify his wrath, \"Be not irritated at the\nabsurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from\nhis good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would\nbear false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, without\nany hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this\ncastle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I\nsay, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he\nsays he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.\"\n\"I swear by God Omnipotent,\" exclaimed Don Quixote at this, \"your\nhighness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come\nbefore this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have\nbeen impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know\nwell enough, from the poor fellow's goodness and harmlessness, that he\nis incapable of bearing false witness against anybody.\"\n\"True, no doubt,\" said Don Fernando, \"for which reason, Se\u00f1or Don\nQuixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your\nfavour, _sicut erat in principio_, before illusions of this sort had\ntaken away his senses.\"\nDon Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for\nSancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for\nthe hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him\nto kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, \"Now, Sancho my son, thou\nwilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee,\nthat everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.\"\n\"So it is, I believe,\" said Sancho, \"except the affair of the blanket,\nwhich came to pass in reality by ordinary means.\"\n\"Believe it not,\" said Don Quixote, \"for had it been so, I would have\navenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could\nI, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.\"\nThey were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the\nlandlord gave them a minute account of Sancho's flights, at which they\nlaughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out\nof countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all\nenchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch\nthat he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,\nwithout any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by\nbeings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms,\nas his master believed and protested.\nThe illustrious company had now been two days in the inn; and as it\nseemed to them time to depart, they devised a plan so that, without\ngiving Dorothea and Don Fernando the trouble of going back with Don\nQuixote to his village under pretence of restoring Queen Micomicona,\nthe curate and the barber might carry him away with them as they\nproposed, and the curate be able to take his madness in hand at home;\nand in pursuance of their plan they arranged with the owner of an\noxcart who happened to be passing that way to carry him after this\nfashion. They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough\nto hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and his\ncompanions, the servants of Don Luis, and the officers of the\nBrotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and advice\nof the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves, some in\none way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite\ndifferent from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, in\nprofound silence they entered the room where he was asleep, taking his\nrest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleeping\ntranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seized\nhim firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awoke\nstartled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at\nthe strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way\nto the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him,\nand took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the\nenchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as\nhe could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the\nconcoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were there\nSancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his own\nproper character, and he, though he was within very little of sharing\nhis master's infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all these\ndisguised figures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until he\nsaw what came of this assault and capture of his master; nor did the\nlatter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which was\nthat bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and nailed the bars\nso firmly that they could not be easily burst open.",

And from\nthis marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave\nwhelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; and\nthis shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in\nhis swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs. And thou,\nO most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side, beard on\nface, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed or grieved to see the\nflower of knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; for\nsoon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thou shalt see\nthyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself, and\nthe promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false;\nand I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana, that thy\nwages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow then\nthe footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient that\nthou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as it\nis not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to\nthat place I wot of;\" and as he brought the prophecy to a close he\nraised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft\ntone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined\nto take what they heard seriously.\nDon Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once\ncomprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to\nhim that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with\nhis beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed\nthe whelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being\nthoroughly and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and\nwith a deep sigh exclaimed, \"Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast\nforetold me so much good, I implore of thee that on my part thou\nentreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests, that he\nleave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying\nme away, ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as\nthose which have been now made me; for, let this but come to pass, and\nI shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chains\nwherewith they bind me, and regard this bed whereon they stretch me,\nnot as a hard battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; and\ntouching the consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire, I rely upon his\ngoodness and rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evil\nfortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in my\npower to give him the island I have promised, or any equivalent for it,\nat least his wages shall not be lost; for in my will, which is already\nmade, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him, measured, not\nby his many faithful services, but by the means at my disposal.\"\nSancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,\nbeing tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions\nlifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.",

Forgive me, fair ladies, if, through inadvertence, I have in\naught offended you; for intentionally and wittingly I have never done\nso to any; and pray to God that he deliver me from this captivity to\nwhich some malevolent enchanter has consigned me; and should I find\nmyself released therefrom, the favours that ye have bestowed upon me in\nthis castle shall be held in memory by me, that I may acknowledge,\nrecognise, and requite them as they deserve.\"\nWhile this was passing between the ladies of the castle and Don\nQuixote, the curate and the barber bade farewell to Don Fernando and\nhis companions, to the captain, his brother, and the ladies, now all\nmade happy, and in particular to Dorothea and Luscinda. They all\nembraced one another, and promised to let each other know how things\nwent with them, and Don Fernando directed the curate where to write to\nhim, to tell him what became of Don Quixote, assuring him that there\nwas nothing that could give him more pleasure than to hear of it, and\nthat he too, on his part, would send him word of everything he thought\nhe would like to know, about his marriage, Zoraida's baptism, Don\nLuis's affair, and Luscinda's return to her home. The curate promised\nto comply with his request carefully, and they embraced once more, and\nrenewed their promises.",

The quick travellers came up with the slow, and courteous\nsalutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in\nfact, a canon of Toledo and master of the others who accompanied him,\nobserving the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers,\nSancho, Rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all Don Quixote\ncaged and confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of\ncarrying the man in that fashion; though, from the badges of the\nofficers, he already concluded that he must be some desperate\nhighwayman or other malefactor whose punishment fell within the\njurisdiction of the Holy Brotherhood. One of the officers to whom he\nhad put the question, replied, \"Let the gentleman himself tell you the\nmeaning of his going this way, se\u00f1or, for we do not know.\"\nDon Quixote overheard the conversation and said, \"Haply, gentlemen, you\nare versed and learned in matters of errant chivalry? Because if you\nare I will tell you my misfortunes; if not, there is no good in my\ngiving myself the trouble of relating them;\" but here the curate and\nthe barber, seeing that the travellers were engaged in conversation\nwith Don Quixote, came forward, in order to answer in such a way as to\nsave their stratagem from being discovered.\nThe canon, replying to Don Quixote, said, \"In truth, brother, I know\nmore about books of chivalry than I do about Villalpando's elements of\nlogic; so if that be all, you may safely tell me what you please.\"\n\"In God's name, then, se\u00f1or,\" replied Don Quixote; \"if that be so, I\nwould have you know that I am held enchanted in this cage by the envy\nand fraud of wicked enchanters; for virtue is more persecuted by the\nwicked than loved by the good. I am a knight-errant, and not one of\nthose whose names Fame has never thought of immortalising in her\nrecord, but of those who, in defiance and in spite of envy itself, and\nall the magicians that Persia, or Brahmans that India, or Gymnosophists\nthat Ethiopia ever produced, will place their names in the temple of\nimmortality, to serve as examples and patterns for ages to come,\nwhereby knights-errant may see the footsteps in which they must tread\nif they would attain the summit and crowning point of honour in arms.\"\n\"What Se\u00f1or Don Quixote of La Mancha says,\" observed the curate, \"is\nthe truth; for he goes enchanted in this cart, not from any fault or\nsins of his, but because of the malevolence of those to whom virtue is\nodious and valour hateful.

He\nis in his full senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like\nother men and as he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that's\nthe case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is\nenchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people\nneither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don't stop him,\nwill talk more than thirty lawyers.\" Then turning to the curate he\nexclaimed, \"Ah, se\u00f1or curate, se\u00f1or curate! do you think I don't know\nyou? Do you think I don't guess and see the drift of these new\nenchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face\nis covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hide\nyour tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where\nthere is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the\ndevil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married\nto the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at\nleast; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my\nmaster, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my\nservices. But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts,\nthat the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that\nthose who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry for my wife and\nchildren, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their\nfather return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom,\nthey will see him come back a horse-boy. I have said all this, se\u00f1or\ncurate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your\nill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you\nto account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way,\nand charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don\nQuixote leaves undone while he is shut up.\n\"Trim those lamps there!\" exclaimed the barber at this; \"so you are of\nthe same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see\nthat you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted\nlike him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an\nevil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and\nthat island you long so much for found its way into your head.\"\n\"I am not with child by anyone,\" returned Sancho, \"nor am I a man to\nlet myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I\nam poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I\nlong for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son\nof his own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say\ngovernor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he\nwill not know whom to give them to.

I say this because we all know one another, and it\nwill not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of\nmy master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it\nworse to stir it.\"\nThe barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he\nshould disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to",

The\ncanon agreed, and going on ahead with his servants, listened with\nattention to the account of the character, life, madness, and ways of\nDon Quixote, given him by the curate, who described to him briefly the\nbeginning and origin of his craze, and told him the whole story of his\nadventures up to his being confined in the cage, together with the plan\nthey had of taking him home to try if by any means they could discover\na cure for his madness. The canon and his servants were surprised anew\nwhen they heard Don Quixote's strange story, and when it was finished\nhe said, \"To tell the truth, se\u00f1or curate, I for my part consider what\nthey call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though,\nled by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all\nthat have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them\nfrom beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the\nsame thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more\nthan that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of\nthe same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical\ntales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly\nthe opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the\nsame time. And though it may be the chief object of such books to\namuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of\nsuch monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must come\nfrom the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the\nthings that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing\nthat has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure.\nWhat beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of\nthe whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of\nsixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of\nhim as if he was an almond cake? And when they want to give us a\npicture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million of\ncombatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book be\nopposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it or\nnot, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his\nstrong arm. And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a\nborn queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some\nunknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and\nuncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of\nknights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and\nwill be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of\nPrester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never described\nnor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that the\nauthors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are\nnot bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is\nall the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more\npleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots\nin fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be\nconstructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing\nover difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise,\ninterest, divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may\nkeep pace one with the other; all which he will fail to effect who\nshuns verisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection\nof writing. I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts\ntogether a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that the\nmiddle agrees with the beginning, and the end with the beginning and\nmiddle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a multitude of\nmembers that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or\nmonster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides all this\nthey are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,\nlicentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix\nin their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels,\nand, in short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which\nreason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a\nworthless breed.\"",

And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors\nthat they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that they\nwould attract more people, and get more credit, by producing plays in\naccordance with the rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are so\nthoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence can\nwean them from it.\n\"I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, 'Tell me,\ndo you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies\nacted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were\nsuch that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and\ninterest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the\nhigher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these three\nalone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?'\n\"'No doubt,' replied the actor in question, 'you mean the \"Isabella,\"\nthe \"Phyllis,\" and the \"Alexandra.\"'\n\"'Those are the ones I mean,' said I; 'and see if they did not observe\nthe principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show\ntheir superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not\nlie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who\ndon't know how to produce something else. \"The Ingratitude Revenged\"\nwas not nonsense, nor was there any in \"The Numantia,\" nor any to be\nfound in \"The Merchant Lover,\" nor yet in \"The Friendly Fair Foe,\" nor\nin some others that have been written by certain gifted poets, to their\nown fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;'\nsome further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him\nrather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could\ndisabuse him of his error.\"",

      "text": "\"You have touched upon a subject, se\u00f1or canon,\" observed the curate\nhere, \"that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in\nvogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the\nbooks of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be\nthe mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of the\ntruth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense,\nmodels of folly, and images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can\nthere be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an\ninfant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first\nact, and in the second a grown-up bearded man? Or what greater\nabsurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a\nswashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using fine language,\na page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a princess who is\na kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their attention to the\ntime in which the action they represent may or can take place, save\nthat I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the second\nin Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been in\nfour acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would have\nbeen laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life is\nthe main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible for\nany average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed\nto pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal\npersonage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered\nJerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of\nBouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and the other?\nor, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are\nintroduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and at\ndifferent times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblance\nof probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of view\nare inexcusable? And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who\nsay that this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected\nrefinement. And then if we turn to sacred dramas\u2014what miracles they\ninvent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to\none saint the miracles of another! And even in secular plays they\nventure to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that\nthey think some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, will\ncome in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play. All\nthis tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history,\nnay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners who\nscrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous\nand ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we\nproduce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief\nobject well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to\nbe performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless\namusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which\nidleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any\nsort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind\nthose who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made,\nsince, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any sort. To\nthis I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all comparison,\nbetter attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so;\nfor after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play, the\nhearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the serious\nparts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by the\narguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples,\ninflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a\ngood play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish\nor dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed\nwith all these qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much\nmore than one wanting in them, like the greater number of those which\nare commonly acted now-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to be\nblamed for this; for some there are among them who are perfectly well\naware of their faults, and know what they ought to do; but as plays\nhave become a salable commodity, they say, and with truth, that the\nactors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so the\npoet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to\npay him for his work. And that this is the truth may be seen by the\ncountless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written,\nwith so much brilliancy, so much grace and gaiety, such polished\nversification, such choice language, such profound reflections, and in\na word, so rich in eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filled\nthe world with his fame; and yet, in consequence of his desire to suit\nthe taste of the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, come\nas near perfection as they ought. Others write plays with such\nheedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors have to fly\nand abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for\nhaving acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to\nsome noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing\nof, would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person\nat the capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only\nthose produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be\nacted in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local\nmagistracy should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors would\ntake care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them in\nsafety, and those who write them would be more careful and take more\npains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to the\nstrict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good plays\nwould be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained; as well\nthe amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of Spain, the\ninterest and safety of the actors, and the saving of trouble in\ninflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some other person\nwere authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry, no\ndoubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described,\nenriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure of\neloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of\nthe new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment, not\nmerely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be\nalways bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful\namusement.\"",

As to what thou sayest,\nthat these who accompany us yonder are the curate and the barber, our\nneighbours and acquaintances, it is very possible that they may seem to\nbe those same persons; but that they are so in reality and in fact,\nbelieve it not on any account; what thou art to believe and think is\nthat, if they look like them, as thou sayest, it must be that those who\nhave enchanted me have taken this shape and likeness; for it is easy\nfor enchanters to take any form they please, and they may have taken\nthose of our friends in order to make thee think as thou dost, and lead\nthee into a labyrinth of fancies from which thou wilt find no escape\nthough thou hadst the cord of Theseus; and they may also have done it\nto make me uncertain in my mind, and unable to conjecture whence this\nevil comes to me; for if on the one hand thou dost tell me that the\nbarber and curate of our village are here in company with us, and on\nthe other I find myself shut up in a cage, and know in my heart that no\npower on earth that was not supernatural would have been able to shut\nme in, what wouldst thou have me say or think, but that my enchantment\nis of a sort that transcends all I have ever read of in all the\nhistories that deal with knights-errant that have been enchanted? So\nthou mayest set thy mind at rest as to the idea that they are what thou\nsayest, for they are as much so as I am a Turk.

Here, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of\nyour sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history,\nin love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners,\nbrave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the\nhonour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I\nam informed, your worship derives your birth.\"\nDon Quixote listened with the greatest attention to the canon's words,\nand when he found he had finished, after regarding him for some time,\nhe replied to him:\n\"It appears to me, gentle sir, that your worship's discourse is\nintended to persuade me that there never were any knights-errant in the\nworld, and that all the books of chivalry are false, lying, mischievous\nand useless to the State, and that I have done wrong in reading them,\nand worse in believing them, and still worse in imitating them, when I\nundertook to follow the arduous calling of knight-errantry which they\nset forth; for you deny that there ever were Amadises of Gaul or of\nGreece, or any other of the knights of whom the books are full.\"\n\"It is all exactly as you state it,\" said the canon; to which Don\nQuixote returned, \"You also went on to say that books of this kind had\ndone me much harm, inasmuch as they had upset my senses, and shut me up\nin a cage, and that it would be better for me to reform and change my\nstudies, and read other truer books which would afford more pleasure\nand instruction.\"\n\"Just so,\" said the canon.\n\"Well then,\" returned Don Quixote, \"to my mind it is you who are the\none that is out of his wits and enchanted, as you have ventured to\nutter such blasphemies against a thing so universally acknowledged and\naccepted as true that whoever denies it, as you do, deserves the same\npunishment which you say you inflict on the books that irritate you\nwhen you read them. For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all\nthe other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never\nexisted, would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not\nyield light, or ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world\ncan persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of\nBurgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible,\nwhich happened in the time of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it\nis as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a\nlie too that there was a Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve\nPeers of France, or Arthur of England, who still lives changed into a\nraven, and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom. One might just as\nwell try to make out that the history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the\nquest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram and\nthe Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere and\nLancelot, when there are persons who can almost remember having seen\nthe Dame Quinta\u00f1ona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain. And\nso true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father's\nside, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say to me,\n'Grandson, that one is like Dame Quinta\u00f1ona,' from which I conclude\nthat she must have known her, or at least had managed to see some\nportrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the\nfair Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king's\narmoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse\nhe rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a\ncart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca's saddle, and at Roncesvalles\nthere is Roland's horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer\nthat there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other\nknights like them, of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Or\nperhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as\nthe valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the\ncity of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by\nname, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de\nRemesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour;\nor adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy,\nby the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of whose\nfamily I come in the direct male line), when they vanquished the sons\nof the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de\nGuevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engaged\nin combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of\nAustria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Qui\u00f1ones, him of\nthe 'Paso,' and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the\nCastilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well\nas many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign\nrealms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies\nthem must be totally wanting in reason and good sense.\"\nThe canon was amazed to hear the medley of truth and fiction Don\nQuixote uttered, and to see how well acquainted he was with everything\nrelating or belonging to the achievements of his knight-errantry; so he\nsaid in reply:\n\"I cannot deny, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, that there is some truth in what you\nsay, especially as regards the Spanish knights-errant; and I am willing\nto grant too that the Twelve Peers of France existed, but I am not\ndisposed to believe that they did all the things that the Archbishop\nTurpin relates of them. For the truth of the matter is they were\nknights chosen by the kings of France, and called 'Peers' because they\nwere all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not\nthey ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like\nthose of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is\nassumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and\ngood birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of\nAlc\u00e1ntara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because\ntwelve equals were chosen for that military order. That there was a\nCid, as well as a Bernardo del Carpio, there can be no doubt; but that\nthey did the deeds people say they did, I hold to be very doubtful. In\nthat other matter of the pin of Count Pierres that you speak of, and\nsay is near Babieca's saddle in the Armoury, I confess my sin; for I am\neither so stupid or so short-sighted, that, though I have seen the\nsaddle, I have never been able to see the pin, in spite of it being as\nbig as your worship says it is.\"\n\"For all that it is there, without any manner of doubt,\" said Don\nQuixote; \"and more by token they say it is inclosed in a sheath of\ncowhide to keep it from rusting.\"\n\"All that may be,\" replied the canon; \"but, by the orders I have\nreceived, I do not remember seeing it. However, granting it is there,\nthat is no reason why I am bound to believe the stories of all those\nAmadises and of all that multitude of knights they tell us about, nor\nis it reasonable that a man like your worship, so worthy, and with so\nmany good qualities, and endowed with such a good understanding, should\nallow himself to be persuaded that such wild crazy things as are",

      "text": "\"A good joke, that!\" returned Don Quixote. \"Books that have been\nprinted with the king's licence, and with the approbation of those to\nwhom they have been submitted, and read with universal delight, and\nextolled by great and small, rich and poor, learned and ignorant,\ngentle and simple, in a word by people of every sort, of whatever rank\nor condition they may be\u2014that these should be lies! And above all when\nthey carry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the\nfather, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements,\nstep by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights!\nHush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to\nact as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see the\npleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell me, can there be\nanything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed\nbefore us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and\nserpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts\nswimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a\nplaintive voice saying: 'Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this\ndread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath\nthese dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself\ninto the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be\nworthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the\nseven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;' and then the knight,\nalmost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider,\nwithout pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing\nhimself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive\narmour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the\nmidst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows\nwhat his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with\nwhich the Elysian fields are not to be compared.\nc50b.jpg (344K)\nFull Size\n\"The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a\nstrange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees\npresents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure,\nwhile the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless\nbirds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing\nbranches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid\ncrystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted\ngold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountain\nof many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic\nfashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow\nmansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with\nfragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of\nvaried aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.\nc50c.jpg (334K)\nFull Size\n\"Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous\npalace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of\njacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the\nmaterials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds,\ncarbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is\nstill more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be more\ncharming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of\nthe castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself\nnow to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never\nhave done; and then how she who seems to be the first among them all\ntakes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand,\nand without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace or\ncastle, and strips him as naked as when his mother bore him, and bathes\nhim in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with sweet-smelling\nunguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented\nand perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his shoulders\na mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and even\nmore? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this,\nthey lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables set out in\nsuch style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they\npour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented\nflowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels\nwait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety\nof dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which\nto select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by\nwhom or whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast is over\nand the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking\nhis teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the\nothers, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by his\nside, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held\nenchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish\nthe readers who are perusing his history.\nc50d.jpg (433K)\nFull Size\n\"But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered\nfrom it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one\nreads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder;\nand take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and\nyou will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise\nyour spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since\nI have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous,\nwell-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have\nlearned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though\nit be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like\na madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune\nthwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able\nto show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my\nfaith, se\u00f1or, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of\ngenerosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree;\nand gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just\nas faith without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad were\nfortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor,\nso as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to\nthis poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world;\nand I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever so\nlong, only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern his\nrealm.\"",

As\nthey were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a\nbell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that\nwere close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat,\nspotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket\nwith a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to\nmake it stop or turn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and\nfrightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection and\nthen stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and\nbegan to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason and\nunderstanding: \"Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you\ngone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, my\ndaughter? Won't you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what\nelse can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet?

Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will\nsoothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest\nherself,\" and so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a\nfork.\nThe goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and\nthen said, \"I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a\nsimpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but\nthe truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used.

But what made him\nstill more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such\nexceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that\neveryone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary\ngifts with which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was\nbeautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen\nshe was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad\nthrough all the villages around\u2014but why do I say the villages around,\nmerely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into\nthe halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who\ncame from all sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious,\nor some wonder-working image?\nHer father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are\nno locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than\nher own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the\ndaughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a\nwife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a\njewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her\ncountless suitors he should entrust her. I was one among the many who\nfelt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I was\nof the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in\npossessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of the\nsame place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made her\nfather's choice hang in the balance, for he felt that on either of us\nhis daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of\nperplexity he resolved to refer the matter to Leandra (for that is the\nname of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting that\nas we were both equal it would be best to leave it to his dear daughter\nto choose according to her inclination\u2014a course that is worthy of\nimitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life. I\ndo not mean that they ought to leave them to make a choice of what is\ncontemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what is\ngood and then allow them to make a good choice as they please. I do not\nknow which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us both off with\nthe tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound him\nnor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio\u2014that\nyou may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy,\nthe end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it\nmust be disastrous.",

A\ncaptain who chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him\noff from our village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now\ntwelve years later the young man came back in a soldier's uniform,\narrayed in a thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine\nsteel chains. To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in\nanother; but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth.\nThe peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they have\nnothing to do can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of\nhis finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had\nthree suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match;\nbut he made so many arrangements and combinations out of them, that if\nthey had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a\ndisplay of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not\nlook upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled\nfor or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. He\nused to seat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza,\nand there he would keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories he\ntold us of his exploits. There was no country on the face of the globe\nhe had not seen, nor battle he had not been engaged in; he had killed\nmore Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more single\ncombats, according to his own account, than Garcilaso, Diego Garc\u00eda de\nParedes and a thousand others he named, and out of all he had come\nvictorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand he showed\nmarks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said were\ngunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, with\nmonstrous impudence he used to say \"you\" to his equals and even those\nwho knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his\ndeeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king\nhimself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a\nmusician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he\nmade it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was\nsomething of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town\nhe made a ballad a league long.",

It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies\nraised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions\non those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they\nsaw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.\nAt the news of Don Quixote's arrival Sancho Panza's wife came running,\nfor she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as\nhis squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if\nthe ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master\nwas.\n\"Thanks be to God,\" said she, \"for being so good to me; but now tell\nme, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you\nbrought me back? What shoes for your children?\"\n\"I bring nothing of that sort, wife,\" said Sancho; \"though I bring\nother things of more consequence and value.\"\n\"I am very glad of that,\" returned his wife; \"show me these things of\nmore value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer\nmy heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have\nbeen away.\"\n\"I will show them to you at home, wife,\" said Sancho; \"be content for\nthe present; for if it please God that we should again go on our\ntravels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or\ngovernor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the\nbest that is to be had.\"\n\"Heaven grant it, husband,\" said she, \"for indeed we have need of it.\nBut tell me, what's this about islands, for I don't understand it?\"\n\"Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,\" returned Sancho; \"all in good\ntime thou shalt see, wife\u2014nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself\ncalled 'your ladyship' by all thy vassals.\"\n\"What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and\nvassals?\" returned Teresa Panza\u2014for so Sancho's wife was called, though\nthey were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to\ntake their husbands' surnames.\n\"Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,\" said Sancho; \"it\nis enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I\nmay tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world\nmore delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a\nknight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one\nfinds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,\nninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience,\nfor out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still,\nfor all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may\nhappen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting\ncastles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the\nmaravedi to pay.\"\nWhile this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don\nQuixote's housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid\nhim in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where\nhe was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her\nuncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his\nescape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to\nbring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and\nrenewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored\nheaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst",
