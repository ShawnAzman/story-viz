An olla of rather more beef than mutton, a salad on most\nnights, scraps on Saturdays, lentils on Fridays, and a pigeon or so\nextra on Sundays, made away with three-quarters of his income. The rest\nof it went in a doublet of fine cloth and velvet breeches and shoes to\nmatch for holidays, while on week-days he made a brave figure in his\nbest homespun. He had in his house a housekeeper past forty, a niece\nunder twenty, and a lad for the field and market-place, who used to\nsaddle the hack as well as handle the bill-hook. The age of this\ngentleman of ours was bordering on fifty; he was of a hardy habit,\nspare, gaunt-featured, a very early riser and a great sportsman. They\nwill have it his surname was Quixada or Quesada (for here there is some\ndifference of opinion among the authors who write on the subject),\nalthough from reasonable conjectures it seems plain that he was called\nQuexana. This, however, is of but little importance to our tale; it\nwill be enough not to stray a hair's breadth from the truth in the\ntelling of it.",

This deficiency,\nhowever, his ingenuity supplied, for he contrived a kind of half-helmet\nof pasteboard which, fitted on to the morion, looked like a whole one.\nIt is true that, in order to see if it was strong and fit to stand a\ncut, he drew his sword and gave it a couple of slashes, the first of\nwhich undid in an instant what had taken him a week to do. The ease\nwith which he had knocked it to pieces disconcerted him somewhat, and\nto guard against that danger he set to work again, fixing bars of iron\non the inside until he was satisfied with its strength; and then, not\ncaring to try any more experiments with it, he passed it and adopted it\nas a helmet of the most perfect construction.\nHe next proceeded to inspect his hack, which, with more quartos than a\nreal and more blemishes than the steed of Gonela, that \"_tantum pellis\net ossa fuit_,\" surpassed in his eyes the Bucephalus of Alexander or\nthe Babieca of the Cid. Four days were spent in thinking what name to\ngive him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse\nbelonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own,\nshould be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so\nas to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant,\nand what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master\ntaking a new character, he should take a new name, and that it should\nbe a distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and\ncalling he was about to follow. And so, after having composed, struck\nout, rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of\nhis memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him Rocinante, a name, to\nhis thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a\nhack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all\nthe hacks in the world.",

Recollecting, however, that the\nvaliant Amadis was not content to call himself curtly Amadis and\nnothing more, but added the name of his kingdom and country to make it\nfamous, and called himself Amadis of Gaul, he, like a good knight,\nresolved to add on the name of his, and to style himself Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha, whereby, he considered, he described accurately his origin\nand country, and did honour to it in taking his surname from it.\nSo then, his armour being furbished, his morion turned into a helmet,\nhis hack christened, and he himself confirmed, he came to the\nconclusion that nothing more was needed now but to look out for a lady\nto be in love with; for a knight-errant without love was like a tree\nwithout leaves or fruit, or a body without a soul. As he said to\nhimself, \"If, for my sins, or by my good fortune, I come across some\ngiant hereabouts, a common occurrence with knights-errant, and\noverthrow him in one onslaught, or cleave him asunder to the waist, or,\nin short, vanquish and subdue him, will it not be well to have someone\nI may send him to as a present, that he may come in and fall on his\nknees before my sweet lady, and in a humble, submissive voice say, 'I\nam the giant Caraculiambro, lord of the island of Malindrania,\nvanquished in single combat by the never sufficiently extolled knight\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, who has commanded me to present myself before\nyour Grace, that your Highness dispose of me at your pleasure'?\" Oh,\nhow our good gentleman enjoyed the delivery of this speech, especially\nwhen he had thought of someone to call his Lady! There was, so the\nstory goes, in a village near his own a very good-looking farm-girl\nwith whom he had been at one time in love, though, so far as is known,\nshe never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter. Her name was\nAldonza Lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the title of\nLady of his Thoughts; and after some search for a name which should not\nbe out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and indicate that of\na princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her Dulcinea del\nToboso\u2014she being of El Toboso\u2014a name, to his mind, musical, uncommon,\nand significant, like all those he had already bestowed upon himself\nand the things belonging to him.",

So, without giving notice of his intention to\nanyone, and without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning\nof the day (which was one of the hottest of the month of July) he\ndonned his suit of armour, mounted Rocinante with his patched-up helmet\non, braced his buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the\nyard sallied forth upon the plain in the highest contentment and\nsatisfaction at seeing with what ease he had made a beginning with his\ngrand purpose. But scarcely did he find himself upon the open plain,\nwhen a terrible thought struck him, one all but enough to make him\nabandon the enterprise at the very outset. It occurred to him that he\nhad not been dubbed a knight, and that according to the law of chivalry\nhe neither could nor ought to bear arms against any knight; and that\neven if he had been, still he ought, as a novice knight, to wear white\narmour, without a device upon the shield until by his prowess he had\nearned one. These reflections made him waver in his purpose, but his\ncraze being stronger than any reasoning, he made up his mind to have\nhimself dubbed a knight by the first one he came across, following the\nexample of others in the same case, as he had read in the books that\nbrought him to this pass. As for white armour, he resolved, on the\nfirst opportunity, to scour his until it was whiter than an ermine; and\nso comforting himself he pursued his way, taking that which his horse\nchose, for in this he believed lay the essence of adventures.",

The\ncomrades of the wounded perceiving the plight they were in began from a\ndistance to shower stones on Don Quixote, who screened himself as best\nhe could with his buckler, not daring to quit the trough and leave his\narmour unprotected. The landlord shouted to them to leave him alone,\nfor he had already told them that he was mad, and as a madman he would\nnot be accountable even if he killed them all. Still louder shouted Don\nQuixote, calling them knaves and traitors, and the lord of the castle,\nwho allowed knights-errant to be treated in this fashion, a villain and\na low-born knight whom, had he received the order of knighthood, he\nwould call to account for his treachery. \"But of you,\" he cried, \"base\nand vile rabble, I make no account; fling, strike, come on, do all ye\ncan against me, ye shall see what the reward of your folly and\ninsolence will be.\" This he uttered with so much spirit and boldness\nthat he filled his assailants with a terrible fear, and as much for\nthis reason as at the persuasion of the landlord they left off stoning\nhim, and he allowed them to carry off the wounded, and with the same\ncalmness and composure as before resumed the watch over his armour.",

As he had\nalready told him, he said, there was no chapel in the castle, nor was\nit needed for what remained to be done, for, as he understood the\nceremonial of the order, the whole point of being dubbed a knight lay\nin the accolade and in the slap on the shoulder, and that could be\nadministered in the middle of a field; and that he had now done all\nthat was needful as to watching the armour, for all requirements were\nsatisfied by a watch of two hours only, while he had been more than\nfour about it. Don Quixote believed it all, and told him he stood there\nready to obey him, and to make an end of it with as much despatch as\npossible; for, if he were again attacked, and felt himself to be dubbed\nknight, he would not, he thought, leave a soul alive in the castle,\nexcept such as out of respect he might spare at his bidding.\nThus warned and menaced, the castellan forthwith brought out a book in\nwhich he used to enter the straw and barley he served out to the\ncarriers, and, with a lad carrying a candle-end, and the two damsels\nalready mentioned, he returned to where Don Quixote stood, and bade him\nkneel down. Then, reading from his account-book as if he were repeating\nsome devout prayer, in the middle of his delivery he raised his hand\nand gave him a sturdy blow on the neck, and then, with his own sword, a\nsmart slap on the shoulder, all the while muttering between his teeth\nas if he was saying his prayers. Having done this, he directed one of\nthe ladies to gird on his sword, which she did with great\nself-possession and gravity, and not a little was required to prevent a\nburst of laughter at each stage of the ceremony; but what they had\nalready seen of the novice knight's prowess kept their laughter within\nbounds. On girding him with the sword the worthy lady said to him, \"May\nGod make your worship a very fortunate knight, and grant you success in\nbattle.\" Don Quixote asked her name in order that he might from that\ntime forward know to whom he was beholden for the favour he had\nreceived, as he meant to confer upon her some portion of the honour he\nacquired by the might of his arm. She answered with great humility that\nshe was called La Tolosa, and that she was the daughter of a cobbler of\nToledo who lived in the stalls of Sanchobienaya, and that wherever she\nmight be she would serve and esteem him as her lord. Don Quixote said\nin reply that she would do him a favour if thenceforward she assumed\nthe \"Don\" and called herself Do\u00f1a Tolosa. She promised she would, and\nthen the other buckled on his spur, and with her followed almost the\nsame conversation as with the lady of the sword. He asked her name, and\nshe said it was La Molinera, and that she was the daughter of a\nrespectable miller of Antequera; and of her likewise Don Quixote\nrequested that she would adopt the \"Don\" and call herself Do\u00f1a\nMolinera, making offers to her further services and favours.\nHaving thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these\nnever-till-now-seen ceremonies, Don Quixote was on thorns until he saw\nhimself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and\nsaddling Rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he\nreturned thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in\nlanguage so extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it\nor report it. The landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no\nless rhetoric though with shorter words, and without calling upon him\nto pay the reckoning let him go with a Godspeed.",

Pay him at once\nwithout another word; if not, by the God that rules us I will make an\nend of you, and annihilate you on the spot; release him instantly.\"\np019.jpg (339K)\nFull Size\nThe farmer hung his head, and without a word untied his servant, of\nwhom Don Quixote asked how much his master owed him.\nHe replied, nine months at seven reals a month. Don Quixote added it\nup, found that it came to sixty-three reals, and told the farmer to pay\nit down immediately, if he did not want to die for it.\nThe trembling clown replied that as he lived and by the oath he had\nsworn (though he had not sworn any) it was not so much; for there were\nto be taken into account and deducted three pairs of shoes he had given\nhim, and a real for two blood-lettings when he was sick.\n\"All that is very well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but let the shoes and the\nblood-lettings stand as a setoff against the blows you have given him\nwithout any cause; for if he spoiled the leather of the shoes you paid\nfor, you have damaged that of his body, and if the barber took blood\nfrom him when he was sick, you have drawn it when he was sound; so on\nthat score he owes you nothing.\"\n\"The difficulty is, Sir Knight, that I have no money here; let Andres\ncome home with me, and I will pay him all, real by real.\"\n\"I go with him!\" said the youth. \"Nay, God forbid! No, se\u00f1or, not for\nthe world; for once alone with me, he would flay me like a Saint\nBartholomew.\"\n\"He will do nothing of the kind,\" said Don Quixote; \"I have only to\ncommand, and he will obey me; and as he has sworn to me by the order of\nknighthood which he has received, I leave him free, and I guarantee the\npayment.\"\n\"Consider what you are saying, se\u00f1or,\" said the youth; \"this master of\nmine is not a knight, nor has he received any order of knighthood; for\nhe is Juan Haldudo the Rich, of Quintanar.\"\n\"That matters little,\" replied Don Quixote; \"there may be Haldudos\nknights; moreover, everyone is the son of his works.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but this master of mine\u2014of what works is\nhe the son, when he refuses me the wages of my sweat and labour?\"\n\"I do not refuse, brother Andres,\" said the farmer, \"be good enough to\ncome along with me, and I swear by all the orders of knighthood there\nare in the world to pay you as I have agreed, real by real, and\nperfumed.\"\n\"For the perfumery I excuse you,\" said Don Quixote; \"give it to him in\nreals, and I shall be satisfied; and see that you do as you have sworn;\nif not, by the same oath I swear to come back and hunt you out and\npunish you; and I shall find you though you should lie closer than a\nlizard. And if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you,\nthat you be more firmly bound to obey it, know that I am the valorous\nDon Quixote of La Mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so,\nGod be with you, and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn\nunder those penalties that have been already declared to you.\"\nSo saying, he gave Rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. The\nfarmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared\nthe wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy Andres, and\nsaid, \"Come here, my son, I want to pay you what I owe you, as that\nundoer of wrongs has commanded me.\"\n\"My oath on it,\" said Andres, \"your worship will be well advised to\nobey the command of that good knight\u2014may he live a thousand years\u2014for,\nas he is a valiant and just judge, by Roque, if you do not pay me, he\nwill come back and do as he said.\"\n\"My oath on it, too,\" said the farmer; \"but as I have a strong\naffection for you, I want to add to the debt in order to add to the\npayment;\" and seizing him by the arm, he tied him up again, and gave\nhim such a flogging that he left him for dead.\n\"Now, Master Andres,\" said the farmer, \"call on the undoer of wrongs;\nyou will find he won't undo that, though I am not sure that I have\nquite done with you, for I have a good mind to flay you alive.\" But at\nlast he untied him, and gave him leave to go look for his judge in\norder to put the sentence pronounced into execution.\nAndres went off rather down in the mouth, swearing he would go to look\nfor the valiant Don Quixote of La Mancha and tell him exactly what had\nhappened, and that all would have to be repaid him sevenfold; but for",

There were six of them coming along\nunder their sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers\non foot. Scarcely had Don Quixote descried them when the fancy\npossessed him that this must be some new adventure; and to help him to\nimitate as far as he could those passages he had read of in his books,\nhere seemed to come one made on purpose, which he resolved to attempt.\nSo with a lofty bearing and determination he fixed himself firmly in\nhis stirrups, got his lance ready, brought his buckler before his\nbreast, and planting himself in the middle of the road, stood waiting\nthe approach of these knights-errant, for such he now considered and\nheld them to be; and when they had come near enough to see and hear, he\nexclaimed with a haughty gesture, \"All the world stand, unless all the\nworld confess that in all the world there is no maiden fairer than the\nEmpress of La Mancha, the peerless Dulcinea del Toboso.\"\nThe traders halted at the sound of this language and the sight of the\nstrange figure that uttered it, and from both figure and language at\nonce guessed the craze of their owner; they wished, however, to learn\nquietly what was the object of this confession that was demanded of\nthem, and one of them, who was rather fond of a joke and was very\nsharp-witted, said to him, \"Sir Knight, we do not know who this good\nlady is that you speak of; show her to us, for, if she be of such\nbeauty as you suggest, with all our hearts and without any pressure we\nwill confess the truth that is on your part required of us.\"\n\"If I were to show her to you,\" replied Don Quixote, \"what merit would\nyou have in confessing a truth so manifest? The essential point is that\nwithout seeing her you must believe, confess, affirm, swear, and defend\nit; else ye have to do with me in battle, ill-conditioned, arrogant\nrabble that ye are; and come ye on, one by one as the order of\nknighthood requires, or all together as is the custom and vile usage of\nyour breed, here do I bide and await you relying on the justice of the\ncause I maintain.\"\n\"Sir Knight,\" replied the trader, \"I entreat your worship in the name\nof this present company of princes, that, to save us from charging our\nconsciences with the confession of a thing we have never seen or heard\nof, and one moreover so much to the prejudice of the Empresses and\nQueens of the Alcarria and Estremadura, your worship will be pleased to\nshow us some portrait of this lady, though it be no bigger than a grain\nof wheat; for by the thread one gets at the ball, and in this way we\nshall be satisfied and easy, and you will be content and pleased; nay,\nI believe we are already so far agreed with you that even though her\nportrait should show her blind of one eye, and distilling vermilion and\nsulphur from the other, we would nevertheless, to gratify your worship,\nsay all in her favour that you desire.\"\n\"She distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble,\" said Don Quixote,",

This seemed to\nhim to fit exactly the case in which he found himself, so, making a\nshow of severe suffering, he began to roll on the ground and with\nfeeble breath repeat the very words which the wounded knight of the\nwood is said to have uttered:\nWhere art thou, lady mine, that thou\nMy sorrow dost not rue?\nThou canst not know it, lady mine,\nOr else thou art untrue.\nAnd so he went on with the ballad as far as the lines:\nO noble Marquis of Mantua,\nMy Uncle and liege lord!\np026.jpg (316K)\nFull Size\nAs chance would have it, when he had got to this line there happened to\ncome by a peasant from his own village, a neighbour of his, who had\nbeen with a load of wheat to the mill, and he, seeing the man stretched\nthere, came up to him and asked him who he was and what was the matter\nwith him that he complained so dolefully.\nDon Quixote was firmly persuaded that this was the Marquis of Mantua,\nhis uncle, so the only answer he made was to go on with his ballad, in\nwhich he told the tale of his misfortune, and of the loves of the\nEmperor's son and his wife all exactly as the ballad sings it.\nThe peasant stood amazed at hearing such nonsense, and relieving him of\nthe visor, already battered to pieces by blows, he wiped his face,\nwhich was covered with dust, and as soon as he had done so he\nrecognised him and said, \"Se\u00f1or Quixada\" (for so he appears to have\nbeen called when he was in his senses and had not yet changed from a\nquiet country gentleman into a knight-errant), \"who has brought your\nworship to this pass?\" But to all questions the other only went on with\nhis ballad.\nSeeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate\nand backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no\nblood nor any mark whatever.

When it was what seemed to him the proper time\nhe entered the village and went to Don Quixote's house, which he found\nall in confusion, and there were the curate and the village barber, who\nwere great friends of Don Quixote, and his housekeeper was saying to\nthem in a loud voice, \"What does your worship think can have befallen\nmy master, Se\u00f1or Licentiate Pero Perez?\" for so the curate was called;\n\"it is three days now since anything has been seen of him, or the hack,\nor the buckler, lance, or armour. Miserable me! I am certain of it, and\nit is as true as that I was born to die, that these accursed books of\nchivalry he has, and has got into the way of reading so constantly,\nhave upset his reason; for now I remember having often heard him saying\nto himself that he would turn knight-errant and go all over the world\nin quest of adventures. To the devil and Barabbas with such books, that\nhave brought to ruin in this way the finest understanding there was in\nall La Mancha!\"\nThe niece said the same, and, more: \"You must know, Master\nNicholas\"\u2014for that was the name of the barber\u2014\"it was often my uncle's\nway to stay two days and nights together poring over these unholy books\nof misventures, after which he would fling the book away and snatch up\nhis sword and fall to slashing the walls; and when he was tired out he\nwould say he had killed four giants like four towers; and the sweat\nthat flowed from him when he was weary he said was the blood of the\nwounds he had received in battle; and then he would drink a great jug\nof cold water and become calm and quiet, saying that this water was a\nmost precious potion which the sage Esquife, a great magician and\nfriend of his, had brought him. But I take all the blame upon myself\nfor never having told your worships of my uncle's vagaries, that you\nmight put a stop to them before things had come to this pass, and burn\nall these accursed books\u2014for he has a great number\u2014that richly deserve\nto be burned like heretics.\"\n\"So say I too,\" said the curate, \"and by my faith to-morrow shall not\npass without public judgment upon them, and may they be condemned to\nthe flames lest they lead those that read to behave as my good friend\nseems to have behaved.\"\nAll this the peasant heard, and from it he understood at last what was\nthe matter with his neighbour, so he began calling aloud, \"Open, your\nworships, to Se\u00f1or Baldwin and to Se\u00f1or the Marquis of Mantua, who\ncomes badly wounded, and to Se\u00f1or Abindarraez, the Moor, whom the\nvaliant Rodrigo de Narvaez, the Alcaide of Antequera, brings captive.\"\nAt these words they all hurried out, and when they recognised their\nfriend, master, and uncle, who had not yet dismounted from the ass\nbecause he could not, they ran to embrace him.\n\"Hold!\" said he, \"for I am badly wounded through my horse's fault;\ncarry me to bed, and if possible send for the wise Urganda to cure and\nsee to my wounds.\"\n\"See there! plague on it!\" cried the housekeeper at this: \"did not my\nheart tell the truth as to which foot my master went lame of? To bed\nwith your worship at once, and we will contrive to cure you here\nwithout fetching that Hurgada. A curse I say once more, and a hundred\ntimes more, on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship\nto such a pass.\"\nThey carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds\ncould find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a\nsevere fall with his horse Rocinante when in combat with ten giants,\nthe biggest and the boldest to be found on earth.\n\"So, so!\" said the curate, \"are there giants in the dance? By the sign\nof the Cross I will burn them to-morrow before the day is over.\"\nThey put a host of questions to Don Quixote, but his only answer to all\nwas\u2014give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was\nwhat he needed most. They did so, and the curate questioned the peasant\nat great length as to how he had found Don Quixote. He told him, and\nthe nonsense he had talked when found and on the way home, all which\nmade the licentiate the more eager to do what he did the next day,\nwhich was to summon his friend the barber, Master Nicholas, and go with",

In short, I say\nthat this book, and all that may be found treating of those French\naffairs, should be thrown into or deposited in some dry well, until\nafter more consideration it is settled what is to be done with them;\nexcepting always one 'Bernardo del Carpio' that is going about, and\nanother called 'Roncesvalles;' for these, if they come into my hands,\nshall pass at once into those of the housekeeper, and from hers into\nthe fire without any reprieve.\"\nTo all this the barber gave his assent, and looked upon it as right and\nproper, being persuaded that the curate was so staunch to the Faith and\nloyal to the Truth that he would not for the world say anything opposed\nto them. Opening another book he saw it was \"Palmerin de Oliva,\" and\nbeside it was another called \"Palmerin of England,\" seeing which the\nlicentiate said, \"Let the Olive be made firewood of at once and burned\nuntil no ashes even are left; and let that Palm of England be kept and\npreserved as a thing that stands alone, and let such another case be\nmade for it as that which Alexander found among the spoils of Darius\nand set aside for the safe keeping of the works of the poet Homer. This\nbook, gossip, is of authority for two reasons, first because it is very\ngood, and secondly because it is said to have been written by a wise\nand witty king of Portugal. All the adventures at the Castle of\nMiraguarda are excellent and of admirable contrivance, and the language\nis polished and clear, studying and observing the style befitting the\nspeaker with propriety and judgment. So then, provided it seems good to\nyou, Master Nicholas, I say let this and 'Amadis of Gaul' be remitted\nthe penalty of fire, and as for all the rest, let them perish without\nfurther question or query.\"",

It was not said to one\ndull or deaf, but to one who enjoyed burning them more than weaving the\nbroadest and finest web that could be; and seizing about eight at a\ntime, she flung them out of the window.\nIn carrying so many together she let one fall at the feet of the\nbarber, who took it up, curious to know whose it was, and found it\nsaid, \"History of the Famous Knight, Tirante el Blanco.\"\n\"God bless me!\" said the curate with a shout, \"'Tirante el Blanco'\nhere! Hand it over, gossip, for in it I reckon I have found a treasury\nof enjoyment and a mine of recreation. Here is Don Kyrieleison of\nMontalvan, a valiant knight, and his brother Thomas of Montalvan, and\nthe knight Fonseca, with the battle the bold Tirante fought with the\nmastiff, and the witticisms of the damsel Placerdemivida, and the loves\nand wiles of the widow Reposada, and the empress in love with the\nsquire Hipolito\u2014in truth, gossip, by right of its style it is the best\nbook in the world. Here knights eat and sleep, and die in their beds,\nand make their wills before dying, and a great deal more of which there\nis nothing in all the other books. Nevertheless, I say he who wrote it,\nfor deliberately composing such fooleries, deserves to be sent to the\ngalleys for life. Take it home with you and read it, and you will see\nthat what I have said is true.\"\n\"As you will,\" said the barber; \"but what are we to do with these\nlittle books that are left?\"\n\"These must be, not chivalry, but poetry,\" said the curate; and opening\none he saw it was the \"Diana\" of Jorge de Montemayor, and, supposing\nall the others to be of the same sort, \"these,\" he said, \"do not\ndeserve to be burned like the others, for they neither do nor can do\nthe mischief the books of chivalry have done, being books of\nentertainment that can hurt no one.\"\n\"Ah, se\u00f1or!\" said the niece, \"your worship had better order these to be\nburned as well as the others; for it would be no wonder if, after being\ncured of his chivalry disorder, my uncle, by reading these, took a\nfancy to turn shepherd and range the woods and fields singing and\npiping; or, what would be still worse, to turn poet, which they say is\nan incurable and infectious malady.\"\n\"The damsel is right,\" said the curate, \"and it will be well to put\nthis stumbling-block and temptation out of our friend's way. To begin,\nthen, with the 'Diana' of Montemayor. I am of opinion it should not be\nburned, but that it should be cleared of all that about the sage\nFelicia and the magic water, and of almost all the longer pieces of\nverse: let it keep, and welcome, its prose and the honour of being the\nfirst of books of the kind.\"\n\"This that comes next,\" said the barber, \"is the 'Diana,' entitled the\n'Second Part, by the Salamancan,' and this other has the same title,\nand its author is Gil Polo.\"\n\"As for that of the Salamancan,\" replied the curate, \"let it go to\nswell the number of the condemned in the yard, and let Gil Polo's be\npreserved as if it came from Apollo himself: but get on, gossip, and\nmake haste, for it is growing late.\"\n\"This book,\" said the barber, opening another, \"is the ten books of the\n'Fortune of Love,' written by Antonio de Lofraso, a Sardinian poet.\"\n\"By the orders I have received,\" said the curate, \"since Apollo has\nbeen Apollo, and the Muses have been Muses, and poets have been poets,\nso droll and absurd a book as this has never been written, and in its\nway it is the best and the most singular of all of this species that\nhave as yet appeared, and he who has not read it may be sure he has\nnever read what is delightful. Give it here, gossip, for I make more\naccount of having found it than if they had given me a cassock of\nFlorence stuff.\"\nHe put it aside with extreme satisfaction, and the barber went on,\n\"These that come next are 'The Shepherd of Iberia,' 'Nymphs of\nHenares,' and 'The Enlightenment of Jealousy.'\"\n\"Then all we have to do,\" said the curate, \"is to hand them over to the\nsecular arm of the housekeeper, and ask me not why, or we shall never\nhave done.\"\n\"This next is the 'Pastor de F\u00edlida.'\"\n\"No Pastor that,\" said the curate, \"but a highly polished courtier; let\nit be preserved as a precious jewel.\"\n\"This large one here,\" said the barber, \"is called 'The Treasury of\nvarious Poems.'\"\n\"If there were not so many of them,\" said the curate, \"they would be\nmore relished: this book must be weeded and cleansed of certain\nvulgarities which it has with its excellences; let it be preserved\nbecause the author is a friend of mine, and out of respect for other\nmore heroic and loftier works that he has written.\"\n\"This,\" continued the barber, \"is the 'Cancionero' of Lopez de\nMaldonado.\"\n\"The author of that book, too,\" said the curate, \"is a great friend of\nmine, and his verses from his own mouth are the admiration of all who\nhear them, for such is the sweetness of his voice that he enchants when\nhe chants them: it gives rather too much of its eclogues, but what is\ngood was never yet plentiful: let it be kept with those that have been\nset apart. But what book is that next it?\"\n\"The 'Galatea' of Miguel de Cervantes,\" said the barber.\n\"That Cervantes has been for many years a great friend of mine, and to\nmy knowledge he has had more experience in reverses than in verses. His\nbook has some good invention in it, it presents us with something but\nbrings nothing to a conclusion: we must wait for the Second Part it\npromises: perhaps with amendment it may succeed in winning the full\nmeasure of grace that is now denied it; and in the mean time do you,\nse\u00f1or gossip, keep it shut up in your own quarters.\"\n\"Very good,\" said the barber; \"and here come three together, the\n'Araucana' of Don Alonso de Ercilla, the 'Austriada' of Juan Rufo,\nJustice of Cordova, and the 'Montserrate' of Christobal de Viru\u00e9s, the\nValencian poet.\"\n\"These three books,\" said the curate, \"are the best that have been\nwritten in Castilian in heroic verse, and they may compare with the\nmost famous of Italy; let them be preserved as the richest treasures of\npoetry that Spain possesses.\"\nThe curate was tired and would not look into any more books, and so he\ndecided that, \"contents uncertified,\" all the rest should be burned;\nbut just then the barber held open one, called \"The Tears of Angelica.\"\n\"I should have shed tears myself,\" said the curate when he heard the\ntitle, \"had I ordered that book to be burned, for its author was one of\nthe famous poets of the world, not to say of Spain, and was very happy\nin the translation of some of Ovid's fables.\"\nc06e.jpg (30K)",

Nor\nneedst thou count this wonderful, for things and chances fall to the\nlot of such knights in ways so unexampled and unexpected that I might\neasily give thee even more than I promise thee.\"\n\"In that case,\" said Sancho Panza, \"if I should become a king by one of\nthose miracles your worship speaks of, even Juana Gutierrez, my old\nwoman, would come to be queen and my children infantes.\"\n\"Well, who doubts it?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I doubt it,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"because for my part I am persuaded\nthat though God should shower down kingdoms upon earth, not one of them\nwould fit the head of Mari Gutierrez. Let me tell you, se\u00f1or, she is\nnot worth two maravedis for a queen; countess will fit her better, and\nthat only with God's help.\"\n\"Leave it to God, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"for he will give her\nwhat suits her best; but do not undervalue thyself so much as to come\nto be content with anything less than being governor of a province.\"\n\"I will not, se\u00f1or,\" answered Sancho, \"specially as I have a man of\nsuch quality for a master in your worship, who will know how to give me\nall that will be suitable for me and that I can bear.\"",

On getting up he tried the bota\nand found it somewhat less full than the night before, which grieved\nhis heart because they did not seem to be on the way to remedy the\ndeficiency readily.

            "text": "They returned to the road they had set out with, leading to Puerto\nLapice, and at three in the afternoon they came in sight of it. \"Here,\nbrother Sancho Panza,\" said Don Quixote when he saw it, \"we may plunge\nour hands up to the elbows in what they call adventures; but observe,\neven shouldst thou see me in the greatest danger in the world, thou\nmust not put a hand to thy sword in my defence, unless indeed thou\nperceivest that those who assail me are rabble or base folk; for in\nthat case thou mayest very properly aid me; but if they be knights it\nis on no account permitted or allowed thee by the laws of knighthood to\nhelp me until thou hast been dubbed a knight.\"\n\"Most certainly, se\u00f1or,\" replied Sancho, \"your worship shall be fully\nobeyed in this matter; all the more as of myself I am peaceful and no\nfriend to mixing in strife and quarrels: it is true that as regards the\ndefence of my own person I shall not give much heed to those laws, for\nlaws human and divine allow each one to defend himself against any\nassailant whatever.\"\n\"That I grant,\" said Don Quixote, \"but in this matter of aiding me\nagainst knights thou must put a restraint upon thy natural\nimpetuosity.\"\n\"I will do so, I promise you,\" answered Sancho, \"and will keep this\nprecept as carefully as Sunday.\"\nWhile they were thus talking there appeared on the road two friars of\nthe order of St. Benedict, mounted on two dromedaries, for not less\ntall were the two mules they rode on. They wore travelling spectacles\nand carried sunshades; and behind them came a coach attended by four or\nfive persons on horseback and two muleteers on foot. In the coach there\nwas, as afterwards appeared, a Biscay lady on her way to Seville, where\nher husband was about to take passage for the Indies with an\nappointment of high honour. The friars, though going the same road,\nwere not in her company; but the moment Don Quixote perceived them he\nsaid to his squire, \"Either I am mistaken, or this is going to be the\nmost famous adventure that has ever been seen, for those black bodies\nwe see there must be, and doubtless are, magicians who are carrying off\nsome stolen princess in that coach, and with all my might I must undo\nthis wrong.\"\n\"This will be worse than the windmills,\" said Sancho. \"Look, se\u00f1or;\nthose are friars of St. Benedict, and the coach plainly belongs to some\ntravellers: I tell you to mind well what you are about and don't let\nthe devil mislead you.\"\n\"I have told thee already, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that on the\nsubject of adventures thou knowest little. What I say is the truth, as\nthou shalt see presently.\"\nSo saying, he advanced and posted himself in the middle of the road\nalong which the friars were coming, and as soon as he thought they had\ncome near enough to hear what he said, he cried aloud, \"Devilish and\nunnatural beings, release instantly the highborn princesses whom you\nare carrying off by force in this coach, else prepare to meet a speedy\ndeath as the just punishment of your evil deeds.\"\nThe friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of Don\nQuixote as well as at his words, to which they replied, \"Se\u00f1or\nCaballero, we are not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of St.\nBenedict following our road, nor do we know whether or not there are\nany captive princesses coming in this coach.\"\n\"No soft words with me, for I know you, lying rabble,\" said Don\nQuixote, and without waiting for a reply he spurred Rocinante and with\nlevelled lance charged the first friar with such fury and\ndetermination, that, if the friar had not flung himself off the mule,\nhe would have brought him to the ground against his will, and sore\nwounded, if not killed outright. The second brother, seeing how his\ncomrade was treated, drove his heels into his castle of a mule and made\noff across the country faster than the wind.",

At\nthat instant the friars' muleteers came up and asked what he was\nstripping him for. Sancho answered them that this fell to him lawfully\nas spoil of the battle which his lord Don Quixote had won. The\nmuleteers, who had no idea of a joke and did not understand all this\nabout battles and spoils, seeing that Don Quixote was some distance off\ntalking to the travellers in the coach, fell upon Sancho, knocked him\ndown, and leaving hardly a hair in his beard, belaboured him with kicks\nand left him stretched breathless and senseless on the ground; and\nwithout any more delay helped the friar to mount, who, trembling,\nterrified, and pale, as soon as he found himself in the saddle, spurred\nafter his companion, who was standing at a distance looking on,\nwatching the result of the onslaught; then, not caring to wait for the\nend of the affair just begun, they pursued their journey making more\ncrosses than if they had the devil after them.\nDon Quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:\n\"Your beauty, lady mine,\" said he, \"may now dispose of your person as\nmay be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your\nravishers lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine;\nand lest you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know\nthat I am called Don Quixote of La Mancha, knight-errant and\nadventurer, and captive to the peerless and beautiful lady Dulcinea del\nToboso: and in return for the service you have received of me I ask no\nmore than that you should return to El Toboso, and on my behalf present\nyourself before that lady and tell her what I have done to set you\nfree.\"\nOne of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a Biscayan, was\nlistening to all Don Quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would\nnot allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to\nEl Toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad\nCastilian and worse Biscayan after his fashion, \"Begone, caballero, and\nill go with thee; by the God that made me, unless thou quittest coach,\nslayest thee as art here a Biscayan.\"\nDon Quixote understood him quite well, and answered him very quietly,\n\"If thou wert a knight, as thou art none, I should have already\nchastised thy folly and rashness, miserable creature.\" To which the\nBiscayan returned, \"I no gentleman!\u2014I swear to God thou liest as I am\nChristian: if thou droppest lance and drawest sword, soon shalt thou\nsee thou art carrying water to the cat: Biscayan on land, hidalgo at\nsea, hidalgo at the devil, and look, if thou sayest otherwise thou\nliest.\"\n\"'\"You will see presently,\" said Agrajes,'\" replied Don Quixote; and\nthrowing his lance on the ground he drew his sword, braced his buckler\non his arm, and attacked the Biscayan, bent upon taking his life.\nThe Biscayan, when he saw him coming on, though he wished to dismount\nfrom his mule, in which, being one of those sorry ones let out for\nhire, he had no confidence, had no choice but to draw his sword; it was\nlucky for him, however, that he was near the coach, from which he was\nable to snatch a cushion that served him for a shield; and they went at\none another as if they had been two mortal enemies. The others strove\nto make peace between them, but could not, for the Biscayan declared in\nhis disjointed phrase that if they did not let him finish his battle he\nwould kill his mistress and everyone that strove to prevent him. The\nlady in the coach, amazed and terrified at what she saw, ordered the\ncoachman to draw aside a little, and set herself to watch this severe\nstruggle, in the course of which the Biscayan smote Don Quixote a\nmighty stroke on the shoulder over the top of his buckler, which, given\nto one without armour, would have cleft him to the waist. Don Quixote,\nfeeling the weight of this prodigious blow, cried aloud, saying, \"O\nlady of my soul, Dulcinea, flower of beauty, come to the aid of this\nyour knight, who, in fulfilling his obligations to your beauty, finds\nhimself in this extreme peril.\" To say this, to lift his sword, to\nshelter himself well behind his buckler, and to assail the Biscayan was\nthe work of an instant, determined as he was to venture all upon a\nsingle blow. The Biscayan, seeing him come on in this way, was\nconvinced of his courage by his spirited bearing, and resolved to\nfollow his example, so he waited for him keeping well under cover of\nhis cushion, being unable to execute any sort of manoeuvre with his\nmule, which, dead tired and never meant for this kind of game, could\nnot stir a step.\nOn, then, as aforesaid, came Don Quixote against the wary Biscayan,\nwith uplifted sword and a firm intention of splitting him in half,\nwhile on his side the Biscayan waited for him sword in hand, and under\nthe protection of his cushion; and all present stood trembling, waiting\nin suspense the result of blows such as threatened to fall, and the\nlady in the coach and the rest of her following were making a thousand\nvows and offerings to all the images and shrines of Spain, that God\nmight deliver her squire and all of them from this great peril in which\nthey found themselves. But it spoils all, that at this point and crisis\nthe author of the history leaves this battle impending, giving as\nexcuse that he could find nothing more written about these achievements\nof Don Quixote than what has been already set forth. It is true the\nsecond author of this work was unwilling to believe that a history so\ncurious could have been allowed to fall under the sentence of oblivion,\nor that the wits of La Mancha could have been so undiscerning as not to\npreserve in their archives or registries some documents referring to\nthis famous knight; and this being his persuasion, he did not despair\nof finding the conclusion of this pleasant history, which, heaven\nfavouring him, he did find in a way that shall be related in the Second",

The discovery of it occurred in this way.\nOne day, as I was in the Alcana of Toledo, a boy came up to sell some\npamphlets and old papers to a silk mercer, and, as I am fond of reading\neven the very scraps of paper in the streets, led by this natural bent\nof mine I took up one of the pamphlets the boy had for sale, and saw\nthat it was in characters which I recognised as Arabic, and as I was\nunable to read them though I could recognise them, I looked about to\nsee if there were any Spanish-speaking Morisco at hand to read them for\nme; nor was there any great difficulty in finding such an interpreter,\nfor even had I sought one for an older and better language I should\nhave found him. In short, chance provided me with one, who when I told\nhim what I wanted and put the book into his hands, opened it in the\nmiddle and after reading a little in it began to laugh. I asked him\nwhat he was laughing at, and he replied that it was at something the\nbook had written in the margin by way of a note. I bade him tell it to\nme; and he still laughing said, \"In the margin, as I told you, this is\nwritten: '_This Dulcinea del Toboso so often mentioned in this history,\nhad, they say, the best hand of any woman in all La Mancha for salting\npigs_.'\"\nWhen I heard Dulcinea del Toboso named, I was struck with surprise and\namazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained\nthe history of Don Quixote. With this idea I pressed him to read the\nbeginning, and doing so, turning the Arabic offhand into Castilian, he\ntold me it meant, \"_History of Don Quixote of La Mancha, written by Cid\nHamete Benengeli, an Arab historian_.\" It required great caution to\nhide the joy I felt when the title of the book reached my ears, and\nsnatching it from the silk mercer, I bought all the papers and\npamphlets from the boy for half a real; and if he had had his wits\nabout him and had known how eager I was for them, he might have safely\ncalculated on making more than six reals by the bargain. I withdrew at\nonce with the Morisco into the cloister of the cathedral, and begged\nhim to turn all these pamphlets that related to Don Quixote into the\nCastilian tongue, without omitting or adding anything to them, offering\nhim whatever payment he pleased. He was satisfied with two arrobas of\nraisins and two bushels of wheat, and promised to translate them\nfaithfully and with all despatch; but to make the matter easier, and\nnot to let such a precious find out of my hands, I took him to my\nhouse, where in little more than a month and a half he translated the",

            "text": "In the first pamphlet the battle between Don Quixote and the Biscayan\nwas drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the\nhistory describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his\nbuckler, the other by his cushion, and the Biscayan's mule so true to\nnature that it could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. The\nBiscayan had an inscription under his feet which said, \"_Don Sancho de\nAzpeitia_,\" which no doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of\nRocinante was another that said, \"_Don Quixote_.\" Rocinante was\nmarvellously portrayed, so long and thin, so lank and lean, with so\nmuch backbone and so far gone in consumption, that he showed plainly\nwith what judgment and propriety the name of Rocinante had been\nbestowed upon him. Near him was Sancho Panza holding the halter of his\nass, at whose feet was another label that said, \"Sancho Zancas,\" and\naccording to the picture, he must have had a big belly, a short body,\nand long shanks, for which reason, no doubt, the names of Panza and\nZancas were given him, for by these two surnames the history several\ntimes calls him. Some other trifling particulars might be mentioned,\nbut they are all of slight importance and have nothing to do with the\ntrue relation of the history; and no history can be bad so long as it\nis true.\nIf against the present one any objection be raised on the score of its\ntruth, it can only be that its author was an Arab, as lying is a very\ncommon propensity with those of that nation; though, as they are such\nenemies of ours, it is conceivable that there were omissions rather\nthan additions made in the course of it. And this is my own opinion;\nfor, where he could and should give freedom to his pen in praise of so\nworthy a knight, he seems to me deliberately to pass it over in\nsilence; which is ill done and worse contrived, for it is the business\nand duty of historians to be exact, truthful, and wholly free from\npassion, and neither interest nor fear, hatred nor love, should make\nthem swerve from the path of truth, whose mother is history, rival of\ntime, storehouse of deeds, witness for the past, example and counsel\nfor the present, and warning for the future. In this I know will be\nfound all that can be desired in the pleasantest, and if it be wanting\nin any good quality, I maintain it is the fault of its hound of an\nauthor and not the fault of the subject. To be brief, its Second Part,\naccording to the translation, began in this way:\nWith trenchant swords upraised and poised on high, it seemed as though\nthe two valiant and wrathful combatants stood threatening heaven, and\nearth, and hell, with such resolution and determination did they bear\nthemselves. The fiery Biscayan was the first to strike a blow, which\nwas delivered with such force and fury that had not the sword turned in\nits course, that single stroke would have sufficed to put an end to the\nbitter struggle and to all the adventures of our knight; but that good\nfortune which reserved him for greater things, turned aside the sword\nof his adversary, so that although it smote him upon the left shoulder,\nit did him no more harm than to strip all that side of its armour,\ncarrying away a great part of his helmet with half of his ear, all\nwhich with fearful ruin fell to the ground, leaving him in a sorry\nplight.\nGood God! Who is there that could properly describe the rage that\nfilled the heart of our Manchegan when he saw himself dealt with in\nthis fashion? All that can be said is, it was such that he again raised\nhimself in his stirrups, and, grasping his sword more firmly with both\nhands, he came down on the Biscayan with such fury, smiting him full\nover the cushion and over the head, that\u2014even so good a shield proving\nuseless\u2014as if a mountain had fallen on him, he began to bleed from\nnose, mouth, and ears, reeling as if about to fall backwards from his\nmule, as no doubt he would have done had he not flung his arms about\nits neck; at the same time, however, he slipped his feet out of the\nstirrups and then unclasped his arms, and the mule, taking fright at\nthe terrible blow, made off across the plain, and with a few plunges\nflung its master to the ground. Don Quixote stood looking on very\ncalmly, and, when he saw him fall, leaped from his horse and with great\nbriskness ran to him, and, presenting the point of his sword to his\neyes, bade him surrender, or he would cut his head off. The Biscayan\nwas so bewildered that he was unable to answer a word, and it would\nhave gone hard with him, so blind was Don Quixote, had not the ladies\nin the coach, who had hitherto been watching the combat in great\nterror, hastened to where he stood and implored him with earnest\nentreaties to grant them the great grace and favour of sparing their\nsquire's life; to which Don Quixote replied with much gravity and\ndignity, \"In truth, fair ladies, I am well content to do what ye ask of\nme; but it must be on one condition and understanding, which is that\nthis knight promise me to go to the village of El Toboso, and on my\nbehalf present himself before the peerless lady Dulcinea, that she deal\nwith him as shall be most pleasing to her.\"\nThe terrified and disconsolate ladies, without discussing Don Quixote's\ndemand or asking who Dulcinea might be, promised that their squire\nshould do all that had been commanded.\n\"Then, on the faith of that promise,\" said Don Quixote, \"I shall do him\nno further harm, though he well deserves it of me.\"",

But let us leave that\nto its own time; see if thou hast anything for us to eat in those\nalforjas, because we must presently go in quest of some castle where we\nmay lodge to-night and make the balsam I told thee of, for I swear to\nthee by God, this ear is giving me great pain.\"\n\"I have here an onion and a little cheese and a few scraps of bread,\"\nsaid Sancho, \"but they are not victuals fit for a valiant knight like\nyour worship.\"\n\"How little thou knowest about it,\" answered Don Quixote; \"I would have\nthee to know, Sancho, that it is the glory of knights-errant to go\nwithout eating for a month, and even when they do eat, that it should\nbe of what comes first to hand; and this would have been clear to thee\nhadst thou read as many histories as I have, for, though they are very\nmany, among them all I have found no mention made of knights-errant\neating, unless by accident or at some sumptuous banquets prepared for\nthem, and the rest of the time they passed in dalliance. And though it\nis plain they could not do without eating and performing all the other\nnatural functions, because, in fact, they were men like ourselves, it\nis plain too that, wandering as they did the most part of their lives\nthrough woods and wilds and without a cook, their most usual fare would\nbe rustic viands such as those thou now offer me; so that, friend\nSancho, let not that distress thee which pleases me, and do not seek to\nmake a new world or pervert knight-errantry.\"\n\"Pardon me, your worship,\" said Sancho, \"for, as I cannot read or\nwrite, as I said just now, I neither know nor comprehend the rules of\nthe profession of chivalry: henceforward I will stock the alforjas with\nevery kind of dry fruit for your worship, as you are a knight; and for\nmyself, as I am not one, I will furnish them with poultry and other\nthings more substantial.\"\n\"I do not say, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that it is imperative on\nknights-errant not to eat anything else but the fruits thou speakest\nof; only that their more usual diet must be those, and certain herbs\nthey found in the fields which they knew and I know too.\"\n\"A good thing it is,\" answered Sancho, \"to know those herbs, for to my\nthinking it will be needful some day to put that knowledge into\npractice.\"\nAnd here taking out what he said he had brought, the pair made their\nrepast peaceably and sociably. But anxious to find quarters for the\nnight, they with all despatch made an end of their poor dry fare,\nmounted at once, and made haste to reach some habitation before night\nset in; but daylight and the hope of succeeding in their object failed\nthem close by the huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass\nthe night there, and it was as much to Sancho's discontent not to have\nreached a house, as it was to his master's satisfaction to sleep under\nthe open heaven, for he fancied that each time this happened to him he\nperformed an act of ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.",

The\nmighty cork trees, unenforced save of their own courtesy, shed the\nbroad light bark that served at first to roof the houses supported by\nrude stakes, a protection against the inclemency of heaven alone. Then\nall was peace, all friendship, all concord; as yet the dull share of\nthe crooked plough had not dared to rend and pierce the tender bowels\nof our first mother that without compulsion yielded from every portion\nof her broad fertile bosom all that could satisfy, sustain, and delight\nthe children that then possessed her. Then was it that the innocent and\nfair young shepherdess roamed from vale to vale and hill to hill, with\nflowing locks, and no more garments than were needful modestly to cover\nwhat modesty seeks and ever sought to hide. Nor were their ornaments\nlike those in use to-day, set off by Tyrian purple, and silk tortured\nin endless fashions, but the wreathed leaves of the green dock and ivy,\nwherewith they went as bravely and becomingly decked as our Court dames\nwith all the rare and far-fetched artifices that idle curiosity has\ntaught them. Then the love-thoughts of the heart clothed themselves\nsimply and naturally as the heart conceived them, nor sought to commend\nthemselves by forced and rambling verbiage. Fraud, deceit, or malice\nhad then not yet mingled with truth and sincerity. Justice held her\nground, undisturbed and unassailed by the efforts of favour and of\ninterest, that now so much impair, pervert, and beset her. Arbitrary\nlaw had not yet established itself in the mind of the judge, for then\nthere was no cause to judge and no one to be judged. Maidens and\nmodesty, as I have said, wandered at will alone and unattended, without\nfear of insult from lawlessness or libertine assault, and if they were\nundone it was of their own will and pleasure. But now in this hateful\nage of ours not one is safe, not though some new labyrinth like that of\nCrete conceal and surround her; even there the pestilence of gallantry\nwill make its way to them through chinks or on the air by the zeal of\nits accursed importunity, and, despite of all seclusion, lead them to\nruin. In defence of these, as time advanced and wickedness increased,\nthe order of knights-errant was instituted, to defend maidens, to\nprotect widows and to succour the orphans and the needy. To this order\nI belong, brother goatherds, to whom I return thanks for the\nhospitality and kindly welcome ye offer me and my squire; for though by\nnatural law all living are bound to show favour to knights-errant, yet,\nseeing that without knowing this obligation ye have welcomed and\nfeasted me, it is right that with all the good-will in my power I\nshould thank you for yours.\"",

Sancho likewise held his peace and ate\nacorns, and paid repeated visits to the second wine-skin, which they\nhad hung up on a cork tree to keep the wine cool.\nDon Quixote was longer in talking than the supper in finishing, at the\nend of which one of the goatherds said, \"That your worship, se\u00f1or\nknight-errant, may say with more truth that we show you hospitality\nwith ready good-will, we will give you amusement and pleasure by making\none of our comrades sing: he will be here before long, and he is a very\nintelligent youth and deep in love, and what is more he can read and\nwrite and play on the rebeck to perfection.\"\nThe goatherd had hardly done speaking, when the notes of the rebeck\nreached their ears; and shortly after, the player came up, a very\ngood-looking young man of about two-and-twenty. His comrades asked him\nif he had supped, and on his replying that he had, he who had already\nmade the offer said to him:\n\"In that case, Antonio, thou mayest as well do us the pleasure of\nsinging a little, that the gentleman, our guest, may see that even in\nthe mountains and woods there are musicians: we have told him of thy\naccomplishments, and we want thee to show them and prove that we say\ntrue; so, as thou livest, pray sit down and sing that ballad about thy\nlove that thy uncle the prebendary made thee, and that was so much\nliked in the town.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said the young man, and without waiting for more\npressing he seated himself on the trunk of a felled oak, and tuning his\nrebeck, presently began to sing to these words.\nANTONIO'S BALLAD\nThou dost love me well, Olalla;\nWell I know it, even though\nLove's mute tongues, thine eyes, have never\nBy their glances told me so.\nFor I know my love thou knowest,\nTherefore thine to claim I dare:\nOnce it ceases to be secret,\nLove need never feel despair.\nTrue it is, Olalla, sometimes\nThou hast all too plainly shown\nThat thy heart is brass in hardness,\nAnd thy snowy bosom stone.\nYet for all that, in thy coyness,\nAnd thy fickle fits between,\nHope is there\u2014at least the border\nOf her garment may be seen.\nLures to faith are they, those glimpses,\nAnd to faith in thee I hold;\nKindness cannot make it stronger,\nColdness cannot make it cold.\nIf it be that love is gentle,\nIn thy gentleness I see\nSomething holding out assurance\nTo the hope of winning thee.\nIf it be that in devotion\nLies a power hearts to move,\nThat which every day I show thee,\nHelpful to my suit should prove.\nMany a time thou must have noticed\u2014\nIf to notice thou dost care\u2014\nHow I go about on Monday\nDressed in all my Sunday wear.\nLove's eyes love to look on brightness;\nLove loves what is gaily drest;\nSunday, Monday, all I care is\nThou shouldst see me in my best.\nNo account I make of dances,\nOr of strains that pleased thee so,\nKeeping thee awake from midnight\nTill the cocks began to crow;\nOr of how I roundly swore it\nThat there's none so fair as thou;\nTrue it is, but as I said it,\nBy the girls I'm hated now.\nFor Teresa of the hillside\nAt my praise of thee was sore;\nSaid, \"You think you love an angel;\nIt's a monkey you adore;\n\"Caught by all her glittering trinkets,\nAnd her borrowed braids of hair,\nAnd a host of made-up beauties\nThat would Love himself ensnare.\"\n'Twas a lie, and so I told her,\nAnd her cousin at the word\nGave me his defiance for it;\nAnd what followed thou hast heard.\nMine is no high-flown affection,\nMine no passion _par amours_\u2014\nAs they call it\u2014what I offer\nIs an honest love, and pure.\nCunning cords the holy Church has,\nCords of softest silk they be;\nPut thy neck beneath the yoke, dear;\nMine will follow, thou wilt see.\nElse\u2014and once for all I swear it\nBy the saint of most renown\u2014\nIf I ever quit the mountains,\n'Twill be in a friar's gown.\nHere the goatherd brought his song to an end, and though Don Quixote\nentreated him to sing more, Sancho had no mind that way, being more\ninclined for sleep than for listening to songs; so said he to his\nmaster, \"Your worship will do well to settle at once where you mean to\npass the night, for the labour these good men are at all day does not\nallow them to spend the night in singing.\"\n\"I understand thee, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote; \"I perceive clearly\nthat those visits to the wine-skin demand compensation in sleep rather\nthan in music.\"\n\"It's sweet to us all, blessed be God,\" said Sancho.\n\"I do not deny it,\" replied Don Quixote; \"but settle thyself where thou\nwilt; those of my calling are more becomingly employed in watching than\nin sleeping; still it would be as well if thou wert to dress this ear\nfor me again, for it is giving me more pain than it need.\"\nSancho did as he bade him, but one of the goatherds, seeing the wound,\ntold him not to be uneasy, as he would apply a remedy with which it\nwould be soon healed; and gathering some leaves of rosemary, of which\nthere was a great quantity there, he chewed them and mixed them with a\nlittle salt, and applying them to the ear he secured them firmly with a\nbandage, assuring him that no other treatment would be required, and so",

            "text": "Don Quixote asked Pedro to tell him who the dead man was and who the\nshepherdess, to which Pedro replied that all he knew was that the dead\nman was a wealthy gentleman belonging to a village in those mountains,\nwho had been a student at Salamanca for many years, at the end of which\nhe returned to his village with the reputation of being very learned\nand deeply read. \"Above all, they said, he was learned in the science\nof the stars and of what went on yonder in the heavens and the sun and\nthe moon, for he told us of the cris of the sun and moon to exact\ntime.\"\n\"Eclipse it is called, friend, not cris, the darkening of those two\nluminaries,\" said Don Quixote; but Pedro, not troubling himself with\ntrifles, went on with his story, saying, \"Also he foretold when the\nyear was going to be one of abundance or estility.\"\n\"Sterility, you mean,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Sterility or estility,\" answered Pedro, \"it is all the same in the\nend. And I can tell you that by this his father and friends who\nbelieved him grew very rich because they did as he advised them,\nbidding them 'sow barley this year, not wheat; this year you may sow\npulse and not barley; the next there will be a full oil crop, and the\nthree following not a drop will be got.'\"\n\"That science is called astrology,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"I do not know what it is called,\" replied Pedro, \"but I know that he\nknew all this and more besides. But, to make an end, not many months\nhad passed after he returned from Salamanca, when one day he appeared\ndressed as a shepherd with his crook and sheepskin, having put off the\nlong gown he wore as a scholar; and at the same time his great friend,\nAmbrosio by name, who had been his companion in his studies, took to\nthe shepherd's dress with him. I forgot to say that Chrysostom, who is\ndead, was a great man for writing verses, so much so that he made\ncarols for Christmas Eve, and plays for Corpus Christi, which the young\nmen of our village acted, and all said they were excellent. When the\nvillagers saw the two scholars so unexpectedly appearing in shepherd's\ndress, they were lost in wonder, and could not guess what had led them\nto make so extraordinary a change. About this time the father of our\nChrysostom died, and he was left heir to a large amount of property in\nchattels as well as in land, no small number of cattle and sheep, and a\nlarge sum of money, of all of which the young man was left dissolute\nowner, and indeed he was deserving of it all, for he was a very good\ncomrade, and kind-hearted, and a friend of worthy folk, and had a\ncountenance like a benediction. Presently it came to be known that he\nhad changed his dress with no other object than to wander about these\nwastes after that shepherdess Marcela our lad mentioned a while ago,\nwith whom the deceased Chrysostom had fallen in love. And I must tell\nyou now, for it is well you should know it, who this girl is; perhaps,\nand even without any perhaps, you will not have heard anything like it\nall the days of your life, though you should live more years than\nsarna.\"\n\"Say Sarra,\" said Don Quixote, unable to endure the goatherd's\nconfusion of words.\n\"The sarna lives long enough,\" answered Pedro; \"and if, se\u00f1or, you must\ngo finding fault with words at every step, we shall not make an end of\nit this twelvemonth.\"\n\"Pardon me, friend,\" said Don Quixote; \"but, as there is such a\ndifference between sarna and Sarra, I told you of it; however, you have\nanswered very rightly, for sarna lives longer than Sarra: so continue\nyour story, and I will not object any more to anything.\"\n\"I say then, my dear sir,\" said the goatherd, \"that in our village\nthere was a farmer even richer than the father of Chrysostom, who was\nnamed Guillermo, and upon whom God bestowed, over and above great\nwealth, a daughter at whose birth her mother died, the most respected\nwoman there was in this neighbourhood; I fancy I can see her now with\nthat countenance which had the sun on one side and the moon on the\nother; and moreover active, and kind to the poor, for which I trust\nthat at the present moment her soul is in bliss with God in the other\nworld. Her husband Guillermo died of grief at the death of so good a\nwife, leaving his daughter Marcela, a child and rich, to the care of an\nuncle of hers, a priest and prebendary in our village. The girl grew up\nwith such beauty that it reminded us of her mother's, which was very\ngreat, and yet it was thought that the daughter's would exceed it; and\nso when she reached the age of fourteen to fifteen years nobody beheld\nher but blessed God that had made her so beautiful, and the greater\nnumber were in love with her past redemption. Her uncle kept her in\ngreat seclusion and retirement, but for all that the fame of her great\nbeauty spread so that, as well for it as for her great wealth, her\nuncle was asked, solicited, and importuned, to give her in marriage not\nonly by those of our town but of those many leagues round, and by the\npersons of highest quality in them. But he, being a good Christian man,\nthough he desired to give her in marriage at once, seeing her to be old\nenough, was unwilling to do so without her consent, not that he had any\neye to the gain and profit which the custody of the girl's property\nbrought him while he put off her marriage; and, faith, this was said in\npraise of the good priest in more than one set in the town. For I would\nhave you know, Sir Errant, that in these little villages everything is\ntalked about and everything is carped at, and rest assured, as I am,\nthat the priest must be over and above good who forces his parishioners\nto speak well of him, especially in villages.\"\n\"That is the truth,\" said Don Quixote; \"but go on, for the story is\nvery good, and you, good Pedro, tell it with very good grace.\"\n\"May that of the Lord not be wanting to me,\" said Pedro; \"that is the\none to have. To proceed; you must know that though the uncle put before\nhis niece and described to her the qualities of each one in particular\nof the many who had asked her in marriage, begging her to marry and\nmake a choice according to her own taste, she never gave any other\nanswer than that she had no desire to marry just yet, and that being so\nyoung she did not think herself fit to bear the burden of matrimony. At\nthese, to all appearance, reasonable excuses that she made, her uncle\nceased to urge her, and waited till she was somewhat more advanced in\nage and could mate herself to her own liking. For, said he\u2014and he said\nquite right\u2014parents are not to settle children in life against their\nwill. But when one least looked for it, lo and behold! one day the\ndemure Marcela makes her appearance turned shepherdess; and, in spite\nof her uncle and all those of the town that strove to dissuade her,\ntook to going a-field with the other shepherd-lasses of the village,\nand tending her own flock. And so, since she appeared in public, and\nher beauty came to be seen openly, I could not well tell you how many\nrich youths, gentlemen and peasants, have adopted the costume of\nChrysostom, and go about these fields making love to her. One of these,\nas has been already said, was our deceased friend, of whom they say\nthat he did not love but adore her. But you must not suppose, because\nMarcela chose a life of such liberty and independence, and of so little\nor rather no retirement, that she has given any occasion, or even the\nsemblance of one, for disparagement of her purity and modesty; on the\ncontrary, such and so great is the vigilance with which she watches\nover her honour, that of all those that court and woo her not one has\nboasted, or can with truth boast, that she has given him any hope\nhowever small of obtaining his desire. For although she does not avoid\nor shun the society and conversation of the shepherds, and treats them\ncourteously and kindly, should any one of them come to declare his\nintention to her, though it be one as proper and holy as that of\nmatrimony, she flings him from her like a catapult. And with this kind\nof disposition she does more harm in this country than if the plague\nhad got into it, for her affability and her beauty draw on the hearts\nof those that associate with her to love her and to court her, but her\nscorn and her frankness bring them to the brink of despair; and so they\nknow not what to say save to proclaim her aloud cruel and hard-hearted,\nand other names of the same sort which well describe the nature of her\ncharacter; and if you should remain here any time, se\u00f1or, you would\nhear these hills and valleys resounding with the laments of the\nrejected ones who pursue her. Not far from this there is a spot where\nthere are a couple of dozen of tall beeches, and there is not one of\nthem but has carved and written on its smooth bark the name of Marcela,\nand above some a crown carved on the same tree as though her lover\nwould say more plainly that Marcela wore and deserved that of all human\nbeauty. Here one shepherd is sighing, there another is lamenting; there\nlove songs are heard, here despairing elegies. One will pass all the\nhours of the night seated at the foot of some oak or rock, and there,\nwithout having closed his weeping eyes, the sun finds him in the\nmorning bemused and bereft of sense; and another without relief or\nrespite to his sighs, stretched on the burning sand in the full heat of\nthe sultry summer noontide, makes his appeal to the compassionate\nheavens, and over one and the other, over these and all, the beautiful\nMarcela triumphs free and careless. And all of us that know her are\nwaiting to see what her pride will come to, and who is to be the happy\nman that will succeed in taming a nature so formidable and gaining\npossession of a beauty so supreme. All that I have told you being such\nwell-established truth, I am persuaded that what they say of the cause\nof Chrysostom's death, as our lad told us, is the same. And so I advise\nyou, se\u00f1or, fail not to be present to-morrow at his burial, which will\nbe well worth seeing, for Chrysostom had many friends, and it is not\nhalf a league from this place to where he directed he should be\nburied.\"",

            "text": "The \"Lay of Chrysostom\" met with the approbation of the listeners,\nthough the reader said it did not seem to him to agree with what he had\nheard of Marcela's reserve and propriety, for Chrysostom complained in\nit of jealousy, suspicion, and absence, all to the prejudice of the\ngood name and fame of Marcela; to which Ambrosio replied as one who\nknew well his friend's most secret thoughts, \"Se\u00f1or, to remove that\ndoubt I should tell you that when the unhappy man wrote this lay he was\naway from Marcela, from whom he had voluntarily separated himself, to\ntry if absence would act with him as it is wont; and as everything\ndistresses and every fear haunts the banished lover, so imaginary\njealousies and suspicions, dreaded as if they were true, tormented\nChrysostom; and thus the truth of what report declares of the virtue of\nMarcela remains unshaken, and with her envy itself should not and\ncannot find any fault save that of being cruel, somewhat haughty, and\nvery scornful.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Vivaldo; and as he was about to read another paper\nof those he had preserved from the fire, he was stopped by a marvellous\nvision (for such it seemed) that unexpectedly presented itself to their\neyes; for on the summit of the rock where they were digging the grave\nthere appeared the shepherdess Marcela, so beautiful that her beauty\nexceeded its reputation. Those who had never till then beheld her gazed\nupon her in wonder and silence, and those who were accustomed to see\nher were not less amazed than those who had never seen her before. But\nthe instant Ambrosio saw her he addressed her, with manifest\nindignation:\n\"Art thou come, by chance, cruel basilisk of these mountains, to see if\nin thy presence blood will flow from the wounds of this wretched being\nthy cruelty has robbed of life; or is it to exult over the cruel work\nof thy humours that thou art come; or like another pitiless Nero to\nlook down from that height upon the ruin of his Rome in embers; or in\nthy arrogance to trample on this ill-fated corpse, as the ungrateful\ndaughter trampled on her father Tarquin's? Tell us quickly for what\nthou art come, or what it is thou wouldst have, for, as I know the\nthoughts of Chrysostom never failed to obey thee in life, I will make\nall these who call themselves his friends obey thee, though he be\ndead.\"\n\"I come not, Ambrosio for any of the purposes thou hast named,\" replied\nMarcela, \"but to defend myself and to prove how unreasonable are all\nthose who blame me for their sorrow and for Chrysostom's death; and\ntherefore I ask all of you that are here to give me your attention, for\nit will not take much time or many words to bring the truth home to\npersons of sense. Heaven has made me, so you say, beautiful, and so\nmuch so that in spite of yourselves my beauty leads you to love me; and\nfor the love you show me you say, and even urge, that I am bound to\nlove you. By that natural understanding which God has given me I know\nthat everything beautiful attracts love, but I cannot see how, by\nreason of being loved, that which is loved for its beauty is bound to\nlove that which loves it; besides, it may happen that the lover of that\nwhich is beautiful may be ugly, and ugliness being detestable, it is\nvery absurd to say, \"I love thee because thou art beautiful, thou must\nlove me though I be ugly.\" But supposing the beauty equal on both\nsides, it does not follow that the inclinations must be therefore\nalike, for it is not every beauty that excites love, some but pleasing\nthe eye without winning the affection; and if every sort of beauty\nexcited love and won the heart, the will would wander vaguely to and\nfro unable to make choice of any; for as there is an infinity of\nbeautiful objects there must be an infinity of inclinations, and true\nlove, I have heard it said, is indivisible, and must be voluntary and\nnot compelled. If this be so, as I believe it to be, why do you desire\nme to bend my will by force, for no other reason but that you say you\nlove me? Nay\u2014tell me\u2014had Heaven made me ugly, as it has made me\nbeautiful, could I with justice complain of you for not loving me?\nMoreover, you must remember that the beauty I possess was no choice of\nmine, for, be it what it may, Heaven of its bounty gave it me without\nmy asking or choosing it; and as the viper, though it kills with it,\ndoes not deserve to be blamed for the poison it carries, as it is a\ngift of nature, neither do I deserve reproach for being beautiful; for\nbeauty in a modest woman is like fire at a distance or a sharp sword;\nthe one does not burn, the other does not cut, those who do not come\ntoo near. Honour and virtue are the ornaments of the mind, without\nwhich the body, though it be so, has no right to pass for beautiful;\nbut if modesty is one of the virtues that specially lend a grace and\ncharm to mind and body, why should she who is loved for her beauty part\nwith it to gratify one who for his pleasure alone strives with all his\nmight and energy to rob her of it? I was born free, and that I might\nlive in freedom I chose the solitude of the fields; in the trees of the\nmountains I find society, the clear waters of the brooks are my\nmirrors, and to the trees and waters I make known my thoughts and\ncharms. I am a fire afar off, a sword laid aside. Those whom I have\ninspired with love by letting them see me, I have by words undeceived,\nand if their longings live on hope\u2014and I have given none to Chrysostom\nor to any other\u2014it cannot justly be said that the death of any is my\ndoing, for it was rather his own obstinacy than my cruelty that killed\nhim; and if it be made a charge against me that his wishes were\nhonourable, and that therefore I was bound to yield to them, I answer\nthat when on this very spot where now his grave is made he declared to\nme his purity of purpose, I told him that mine was to live in perpetual\nsolitude, and that the earth alone should enjoy the fruits of my\nretirement and the spoils of my beauty; and if, after this open avowal,\nhe chose to persist against hope and steer against the wind, what\nwonder is it that he should sink in the depths of his infatuation? If I\nhad encouraged him, I should be false; if I had gratified him, I should\nhave acted against my own better resolution and purpose. He was\npersistent in spite of warning, he despaired without being hated.\nBethink you now if it be reasonable that his suffering should be laid\nto my charge. Let him who has been deceived complain, let him give way\nto despair whose encouraged hopes have proved vain, let him flatter\nhimself whom I shall entice, let him boast whom I shall receive; but\nlet not him call me cruel or homicide to whom I make no promise, upon\nwhom I practise no deception, whom I neither entice nor receive. It has\nnot been so far the will of Heaven that I should love by fate, and to\nexpect me to love by choice is idle. Let this general declaration serve\nfor each of my suitors on his own account, and let it be understood\nfrom this time forth that if anyone dies for me it is not of jealousy\nor misery he dies, for she who loves no one can give no cause for\njealousy to any, and candour is not to be confounded with scorn. Let\nhim who calls me wild beast and basilisk, leave me alone as something\nnoxious and evil; let him who calls me ungrateful, withhold his\nservice; who calls me wayward, seek not my acquaintance; who calls me\ncruel, pursue me not; for this wild beast, this basilisk, this\nungrateful, cruel, wayward being has no kind of desire to seek, serve,\nknow, or follow them. If Chrysostom's impatience and violent passion\nkilled him, why should my modest behaviour and circumspection be\nblamed? If I preserve my purity in the society of the trees, why should\nhe who would have me preserve it among men, seek to rob me of it? I\nhave, as you know, wealth of my own, and I covet not that of others; my\ntaste is for freedom, and I have no relish for constraint; I neither\nlove nor hate anyone; I do not deceive this one or court that, or\ntrifle with one or play with another. The modest converse of the\nshepherd girls of these hamlets and the care of my goats are my\nrecreations; my desires are bounded by these mountains, and if they\never wander hence it is to contemplate the beauty of the heavens, steps\nby which the soul travels to its primeval abode.\"\nWith these words, and not waiting to hear a reply, she turned and",

It is that when thou shalt see rabble of this\nsort offering us insult thou art not to wait till I draw sword against\nthem, for I shall not do so at all; but do thou draw sword and chastise\nthem to thy heart's content, and if any knights come to their aid and\ndefence I will take care to defend thee and assail them with all my\nmight; and thou hast already seen by a thousand signs and proofs what\nthe might of this strong arm of mine is equal to\"\u2014so uplifted had the\npoor gentleman become through the victory over the stout Biscayan.\nBut Sancho did not so fully approve of his master's admonition as to\nlet it pass without saying in reply, \"Se\u00f1or, I am a man of peace, meek\nand quiet, and I can put up with any affront because I have a wife and\nchildren to support and bring up; so let it be likewise a hint to your\nworship, as it cannot be a mandate, that on no account will I draw\nsword either against clown or against knight, and that here before God\nI forgive the insults that have been offered me, whether they have\nbeen, are, or shall be offered me by high or low, rich or poor, noble\nor commoner, not excepting any rank or condition whatsoever.\"\nTo all which his master said in reply, \"I wish I had breath enough to\nspeak somewhat easily, and that the pain I feel on this side would\nabate so as to let me explain to thee, Panza, the mistake thou makest.\nCome now, sinner, suppose the wind of fortune, hitherto so adverse,\nshould turn in our favour, filling the sails of our desires so that\nsafely and without impediment we put into port in some one of those\nislands I have promised thee, how would it be with thee if on winning\nit I made thee lord of it? Why, thou wilt make it well-nigh impossible\nthrough not being a knight nor having any desire to be one, nor\npossessing the courage nor the will to avenge insults or defend thy\nlordship; for thou must know that in newly conquered kingdoms and\nprovinces the minds of the inhabitants are never so quiet nor so well\ndisposed to the new lord that there is no fear of their making some\nmove to change matters once more, and try, as they say, what chance may\ndo for them; so it is essential that the new possessor should have good\nsense to enable him to govern, and valour to attack and defend himself,\nwhatever may befall him.\"\n\"In what has now befallen us,\" answered Sancho, \"I'd have been well\npleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,\nbut I swear on the faith of a poor man I am more fit for plasters than\nfor arguments. See if your worship can get up, and let us help\nRocinante, though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of\nall this thrashing. I never thought it of Rocinante, for I took him to\nbe a virtuous person and as quiet as myself. After all, they say right\nthat it takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is\nnothing sure in this life. Who would have said that, after such mighty\nslashes as your worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was\ncoming, travelling post and at the very heels of them, such a great\nstorm of sticks as has fallen upon our shoulders?\"\n\"And yet thine, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"ought to be used to such\nsqualls; but mine, reared in soft cloth and fine linen, it is plain\nthey must feel more keenly the pain of this mishap, and if it were not\nthat I imagine\u2014why do I say imagine?\u2014know of a certainty that all these\nannoyances are very necessary accompaniments of the calling of arms, I\nwould lay me down here to die of pure vexation.\"\nTo this the squire replied, \"Se\u00f1or, as these mishaps are what one reaps\nof chivalry, tell me if they happen very often, or if they have their\nown fixed times for coming to pass; because it seems to me that after\ntwo harvests we shall be no good for the third, unless God in his\ninfinite mercy helps us.\"\n\"Know, friend Sancho,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that the life of\nknights-errant is subject to a thousand dangers and reverses, and\nneither more nor less is it within immediate possibility for\nknights-errant to become kings and emperors, as experience has shown in\nthe case of many different knights with whose histories I am thoroughly\nacquainted; and I could tell thee now, if the pain would let me, of\nsome who simply by might of arm have risen to the high stations I have\nmentioned; and those same, both before and after, experienced divers\nmisfortunes and miseries; for the valiant Amadis of Gaul found himself\nin the power of his mortal enemy Arcalaus the magician, who, it is\npositively asserted, holding him captive, gave him more than two\nhundred lashes with the reins of his horse while tied to one of the\npillars of a court; and moreover there is a certain recondite author of\nno small authority who says that the Knight of Ph\u0153bus, being caught in\na certain pitfall, which opened under his feet in a certain castle, on\nfalling found himself bound hand and foot in a deep pit underground,\nwhere they administered to him one of those things they call clysters,\nof sand and snow-water, that well-nigh finished him; and if he had not\nbeen succoured in that sore extremity by a sage, a great friend of his,\nit would have gone very hard with the poor knight; so I may well suffer\nin company with such worthy folk, for greater were the indignities\nwhich they had to suffer than those which we suffer. For I would have\nthee know, Sancho, that wounds caused by any instruments which happen\nby chance to be in hand inflict no indignity, and this is laid down in\nthe law of the duel in express words: if, for instance, the cobbler\nstrikes another with the last which he has in his hand, though it be in\nfact a piece of wood, it cannot be said for that reason that he whom he\nstruck with it has been cudgelled. I say this lest thou shouldst\nimagine that because we have been drubbed in this affray we have\ntherefore suffered any indignity; for the arms those men carried, with\nwhich they pounded us, were nothing more than their stakes, and not one\nof them, so far as I remember, carried rapier, sword, or dagger.\"\n\"They gave me no time to see that much,\" answered Sancho, \"for hardly\nhad I laid hand on my tizona when they signed the cross on my shoulders\nwith their sticks in such style that they took the sight out of my eyes\nand the strength out of my feet, stretching me where I now lie, and\nwhere thinking of whether all those stake-strokes were an indignity or\nnot gives me no uneasiness, which the pain of the blows does, for they\nwill remain as deeply impressed on my memory as on my shoulders.\"\n\"For all that let me tell thee, brother Panza,\" said Don Quixote, \"that\nthere is no recollection which time does not put an end to, and no pain\nwhich death does not remove.\"\n\"And what greater misfortune can there be,\" replied Panza, \"than the\none that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? If\nour mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters,\nit would not be so bad; but I am beginning to think that all the\nplasters in a hospital almost won't be enough to put us right.\"\n\"No more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, Sancho, as I mean to\ndo,\" returned Don Quixote, \"and let us see how Rocinante is, for it\nseems to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the\nlot of the poor beast.\"\n\"There is nothing wonderful in that,\" replied Sancho, \"since he is a\nknight-errant too; what I wonder at is that my beast should have come\noff scot-free where we come out scotched.\"\n\"Fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring\nrelief to it,\" said Don Quixote; \"I say so because this little beast\nmay now supply the want of Rocinante, carrying me hence to some castle\nwhere I may be cured of my wounds. And moreover I shall not hold it any\ndishonour to be so mounted, for I remember having read how the good old\nSilenus, the tutor and instructor of the gay god of laughter, when he\nentered the city of the hundred gates, went very contentedly mounted on\na handsome ass.\"\n\"It may be true that he went mounted as your worship says,\" answered\nSancho, \"but there is a great difference between going mounted and\ngoing slung like a sack of manure.\"\nTo which Don Quixote replied, \"Wounds received in battle confer honour\ninstead of taking it away; and so, friend Panza, say no more, but, as I\ntold thee before, get up as well as thou canst and put me on top of thy\nbeast in whatever fashion pleases thee best, and let us go hence ere\nnight come on and surprise us in these wilds.\"",

Sancho answered that it was nothing, only that\nhe had fallen down from a rock and had his ribs a little bruised. The\ninnkeeper had a wife whose disposition was not such as those of her\ncalling commonly have, for she was by nature kind-hearted and felt for\nthe sufferings of her neighbours, so she at once set about tending Don\nQuixote, and made her young daughter, a very comely girl, help her in\ntaking care of her guest. There was besides in the inn, as servant, an\nAsturian lass with a broad face, flat poll, and snub nose, blind of one\neye and not very sound in the other. The elegance of her shape, to be\nsure, made up for all her defects; she did not measure seven palms from\nhead to foot, and her shoulders, which overweighted her somewhat, made\nher contemplate the ground more than she liked. This graceful lass,\nthen, helped the young girl, and the two made up a very bad bed for Don\nQuixote in a garret that showed evident signs of having formerly served\nfor many years as a straw-loft, in which there was also quartered a\ncarrier whose bed was placed a little beyond our Don Quixote's, and,\nthough only made of the pack-saddles and cloths of his mules, had much\nthe advantage of it, as Don Quixote's consisted simply of four rough\nboards on two not very even trestles, a mattress, that for thinness\nmight have passed for a quilt, full of pellets which, were they not\nseen through the rents to be wool, would to the touch have seemed\npebbles in hardness, two sheets made of buckler leather, and a coverlet\nthe threads of which anyone that chose might have counted without\nmissing one in the reckoning.\nOn this accursed bed Don Quixote stretched himself, and the hostess and\nher daughter soon covered him with plasters from top to toe, while\nMaritornes\u2014for that was the name of the Asturian\u2014held the light for\nthem, and while plastering him, the hostess, observing how full of\nwheals Don Quixote was in some places, remarked that this had more the\nlook of blows than of a fall.\nIt was not blows, Sancho said, but that the rock had many points and\nprojections, and that each of them had left its mark. \"Pray, se\u00f1ora,\"\nhe added, \"manage to save some tow, as there will be no want of someone\nto use it, for my loins too are rather sore.\"\n\"Then you must have fallen too,\" said the hostess.\n\"I did not fall,\" said Sancho Panza, \"but from the shock I got at\nseeing my master fall, my body aches so that I feel as if I had had a\nthousand thwacks.\"\n\"That may well be,\" said the young girl, \"for it has many a time\nhappened to me to dream that I was falling down from a tower and never\ncoming to the ground, and when I awoke from the dream to find myself as\nweak and shaken as if I had really fallen.\"\n\"There is the point, se\u00f1ora,\" replied Sancho Panza, \"that I without\ndreaming at all, but being more awake than I am now, find myself with\nscarcely less wheals than my master, Don Quixote.\"\n\"How is the gentleman called?\" asked Maritornes the Asturian.\n\"Don Quixote of La Mancha,\" answered Sancho Panza, \"and he is a\nknight-adventurer, and one of the best and stoutest that have been seen\nin the world this long time past.\"\n\"What is a knight-adventurer?\" said the lass.\n\"Are you so new in the world as not to know?\" answered Sancho Panza.\n\"Well, then, you must know, sister, that a knight-adventurer is a thing\nthat in two words is seen drubbed and emperor, that is to-day the most\nmiserable and needy being in the world, and to-morrow will have two or\nthree crowns of kingdoms to give his squire.\"\n\"Then how is it,\" said the hostess, \"that belonging to so good a master\nas this, you have not, to judge by appearances, even so much as a\ncounty?\"\n\"It is too soon yet,\" answered Sancho, \"for we have only been a month\ngoing in quest of adventures, and so far we have met with nothing that\ncan be called one, for it will happen that when one thing is looked for\nanother thing is found; however, if my master Don Quixote gets well of\nthis wound, or fall, and I am left none the worse of it, I would not\nchange my hopes for the best title in Spain.\"\nTo all this conversation Don Quixote was listening very attentively,\nand sitting up in bed as well as he could, and taking the hostess by\nthe hand he said to her, \"Believe me, fair lady, you may call yourself\nfortunate in having in this castle of yours sheltered my person, which\nis such that if I do not myself praise it, it is because of what is\ncommonly said, that self-praise debaseth; but my squire will inform you\nwho I am. I only tell you that I shall preserve for ever inscribed on\nmy memory the service you have rendered me in order to tender you my\ngratitude while life shall last me; and would to Heaven love held me\nnot so enthralled and subject to its laws and to the eyes of that fair\ningrate whom I name between my teeth, but that those of this lovely\ndamsel might be the masters of my liberty.\"\nThe hostess, her daughter, and the worthy Maritornes listened in\nbewilderment to the words of the knight-errant; for they understood\nabout as much of them as if he had been talking Greek, though they\ncould perceive they were all meant for expressions of good-will and\nblandishments; and not being accustomed to this kind of language, they\nstared at him and wondered to themselves, for he seemed to them a man\nof a different sort from those they were used to, and thanking him in\npothouse phrase for his civility they left him, while the Asturian gave\nher attention to Sancho, who needed it no less than his master.",

What I could tell thee of the charms of her person! of her\nlively wit! of other secret matters which, to preserve the fealty I owe\nto my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, I shall pass over unnoticed and in\nsilence! I will only tell thee that, either fate being envious of so\ngreat a boon placed in my hands by good fortune, or perhaps (and this\nis more probable) this castle being, as I have already said, enchanted,\nat the time when I was engaged in the sweetest and most amorous\ndiscourse with her, there came, without my seeing or knowing whence it\ncame, a hand attached to some arm of some huge giant, that planted such\na cuff on my jaws that I have them all bathed in blood, and then\npummelled me in such a way that I am in a worse plight than yesterday\nwhen the carriers, on account of Rocinante's misbehaviour, inflicted on\nus the injury thou knowest of; whence conjecture that there must be\nsome enchanted Moor guarding the treasure of this damsel's beauty, and\nthat it is not for me.\"\n\"Not for me either,\" said Sancho, \"for more than four hundred Moors\nhave so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and\nfancy-bread to it. But tell me, se\u00f1or, what do you call this excellent\nand rare adventure that has left us as we are left now? Though your\nworship was not so badly off, having in your arms that incomparable\nbeauty you spoke of; but I, what did I have, except the heaviest whacks\nI think I had in all my life? Unlucky me and the mother that bore me!\nfor I am not a knight-errant and never expect to be one, and of all the\nmishaps, the greater part falls to my share.\"\n\"Then thou hast been thrashed too?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Didn't I say so? worse luck to my line!\" said Sancho.\n\"Be not distressed, friend,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will now make the\nprecious balsam with which we shall cure ourselves in the twinkling of\nan eye.\"\nBy this time the cuadrillero had succeeded in lighting the lamp, and\ncame in to see the man that he thought had been killed; and as Sancho\ncaught sight of him at the door, seeing him coming in his shirt, with a\ncloth on his head, and a lamp in his hand, and a very forbidding\ncountenance, he said to his master, \"Se\u00f1or, can it be that this is the\nenchanted Moor coming back to give us more castigation if there be\nanything still left in the ink-bottle?\"\n\"It cannot be the Moor,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for those under\nenchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone.\"\n\"If they don't let themselves be seen, they let themselves be felt,\"\nsaid Sancho; \"if not, let my shoulders speak to the point.\"\n\"Mine could speak too,\" said Don Quixote, \"but that is not a sufficient\nreason for believing that what we see is the enchanted Moor.\"\nThe officer came up, and finding them engaged in such a peaceful\nconversation, stood amazed; though Don Quixote, to be sure, still lay\non his back unable to move from pure pummelling and plasters. The\nofficer turned to him and said, \"Well, how goes it, good man?\"\n\"I would speak more politely if I were you,\" replied Don Quixote; \"is\nit the way of this country to address knights-errant in that style, you\nbooby?\"\nThe cuadrillero finding himself so disrespectfully treated by such a\nsorry-looking individual, lost his temper, and raising the lamp full of\noil, smote Don Quixote such a blow with it on the head that he gave him\na badly broken pate; then, all being in darkness, he went out, and\nSancho Panza said, \"That is certainly the enchanted Moor, Se\u00f1or, and he\nkeeps the treasure for others, and for us only the cuffs and\nlamp-whacks.\"\n\"That is the truth,\" answered Don Quixote, \"and there is no use in\ntroubling oneself about these matters of enchantment or being angry or\nvexed at them, for as they are invisible and visionary we shall find no\none on whom to avenge ourselves, do what we may; rise, Sancho, if thou\ncanst, and call the alcaide of this fortress, and get him to give me a\nlittle oil, wine, salt, and rosemary to make the salutiferous balsam,\nfor indeed I believe I have great need of it now, because I am losing\nmuch blood from the wound that phantom gave me.\"\nSancho got up with pain enough in his bones, and went after the\ninnkeeper in the dark, and meeting the officer, who was looking to see\nwhat had become of his enemy, he said to him, \"Se\u00f1or, whoever you are,\ndo us the favour and kindness to give us a little rosemary, oil, salt,\nand wine, for it is wanted to cure one of the best knights-errant on\nearth, who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted\nMoor that is in this inn.\"\nWhen the officer heard him talk in this way, he took him for a man out\nof his senses, and as day was now beginning to break, he opened the inn\ngate, and calling the host, he told him what this good man wanted. The\nhost furnished him with what he required, and Sancho brought it to Don\nQuixote, who, with his hand to his head, was bewailing the pain of the\nblow of the lamp, which had done him no more harm than raising a couple\nof rather large lumps, and what he fancied blood was only the sweat\nthat flowed from him in his sufferings during the late storm. To be\nbrief, he took the materials, of which he made a compound, mixing them\nall and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come\nto perfection. He then asked for some vial to pour it into, and as\nthere was not one in the inn, he decided on putting it into a tin\noil-bottle or flask of which the host made him a free gift; and over\nthe flask he repeated more than eighty paternosters and as many more\nave-marias, salves, and credos, accompanying each word with a cross by\nway of benediction, at all which there were present Sancho, the\ninnkeeper, and the cuadrillero; for the carrier was now peacefully\nengaged in attending to the comfort of his mules.\nThis being accomplished, he felt anxious to make trial himself, on the\nspot, of the virtue of this precious balsam, as he considered it, and\nso he drank near a quart of what could not be put into the flask and\nremained in the pigskin in which it had been boiled; but scarcely had\nhe done drinking when he began to vomit in such a way that nothing was\nleft in his stomach, and with the pangs and spasms of vomiting he broke\ninto a profuse sweat, on account of which he bade them cover him up and\nleave him alone. They did so, and he lay sleeping more than three\nhours, at the end of which he awoke and felt very great bodily relief\nand so much ease from his bruises that he thought himself quite cured,\nand verily believed he had hit upon the balsam of Fierabras; and that\nwith this remedy he might thenceforward, without any fear, face any\nkind of destruction, battle, or combat, however perilous it might be.\nSancho Panza, who also regarded the amendment of his master as\nmiraculous, begged him to give him what was left in the pigskin, which\nwas no small quantity. Don Quixote consented, and he, taking it with\nboth hands, in good faith and with a better will, gulped down and\ndrained off very little less than his master. But the fact is, that the\nstomach of poor Sancho was of necessity not so delicate as that of his\nmaster, and so, before vomiting, he was seized with such gripings and\nretchings, and such sweats and faintness, that verily and truly he\nbelieved his last hour had come, and finding himself so racked and\ntormented he cursed the balsam and the thief that had given it to him.\nDon Quixote seeing him in this state said, \"It is my belief, Sancho,\nthat this mischief comes of thy not being dubbed a knight, for I am\npersuaded this liquor cannot be good for those who are not so.\"\n\"If your worship knew that,\" returned Sancho\u2014\"woe betide me and all my\nkindred!\u2014why did you let me taste it?\"\nAt this moment the draught took effect, and the poor squire began to\ndischarge both ways at such a rate that the rush mat on which he had\nthrown himself and the canvas blanket he had covering him were fit for\nnothing afterwards. He sweated and perspired with such paroxysms and\nconvulsions that not only he himself but all present thought his end\nhad come. This tempest and tribulation lasted about two hours, at the\nend of which he was left, not like his master, but so weak and\nexhausted that he could not stand. Don Quixote, however, who, as has\nbeen said, felt himself relieved and well, was eager to take his\ndeparture at once in quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all\nthe time he loitered there was a fraud upon the world and those in it\nwho stood in need of his help and protection, all the more when he had\nthe security and confidence his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by\nthis impulse, he saddled Rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on\nhis squire's beast, whom likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass;\nafter which he mounted his horse and turning to a corner of the inn he\nlaid hold of a pike that stood there, to serve him by way of a lance.\nAll that were in the inn, who were more than twenty persons, stood\nwatching him; the innkeeper's daughter was likewise observing him, and\nhe too never took his eyes off her, and from time to time fetched a\nsigh that he seemed to pluck up from the depths of his bowels; but they\nall thought it must be from the pain he felt in his ribs; at any rate\nthey who had seen him plastered the night before thought so.\nAs soon as they were both mounted, at the gate of the inn, he called to\nthe host and said in a very grave and measured voice, \"Many and great\nare the favours, Se\u00f1or Alcaide, that I have received in this castle of\nyours, and I remain under the deepest obligation to be grateful to you\nfor them all the days of my life; if I can repay them in avenging you\nof any arrogant foe who may have wronged you, know that my calling is\nno other than to aid the weak, to avenge those who suffer wrong, and to\nchastise perfidy. Search your memory, and if you find anything of this\nkind you need only tell me of it, and I promise you by the order of\nknighthood which I have received to procure you satisfaction and\nreparation to the utmost of your desire.\"\nThe innkeeper replied to him with equal calmness, \"Sir Knight, I do not\nwant your worship to avenge me of any wrong, because when any is done\nme I can take what vengeance seems good to me; the only thing I want is\nthat you pay me the score that you have run up in the inn last night,\nas well for the straw and barley for your two beasts, as for supper and\nbeds.\"\nc16c.jpg (326K)\nFull Size\n\"Then this is an inn?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"And a very respectable one,\" said the innkeeper.\n\"I have been under a mistake all this time,\" answered Don Quixote, \"for\nin truth I thought it was a castle, and not a bad one; but since it\nappears that it is not a castle but an inn, all that can be done now is\nthat you should excuse the payment, for I cannot contravene the rule of\nknights-errant, of whom I know as a fact (and up to the present I have\nread nothing to the contrary) that they never paid for lodging or\nanything else in the inn where they might be; for any hospitality that\nmight be offered them is their due by law and right in return for the\ninsufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by\nday, in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and\nthirst, cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and\nall the hardships of earth.\"\n\"I have little to do with that,\" replied the innkeeper; \"pay me what\nyou owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all I care\nabout is to get my money.\"\n\"You are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper,\" said Don Quixote, and putting\nspurs to Rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of\nthe inn before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance\nwithout looking to see if his squire was following him.\nThe innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment\nof Sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,\nbecause, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and\nreason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying",

It so\nhappened that the night closed in somewhat darkly, but for all that\nthey pushed on, Sancho feeling sure that as the road was the king's\nhighway they might reasonably expect to find some inn within a league\nor two. Going along, then, in this way, the night dark, the squire\nhungry, the master sharp-set, they saw coming towards them on the road\nthey were travelling a great number of lights which looked exactly like\nstars in motion. Sancho was taken aback at the sight of them, nor did\nDon Quixote altogether relish them: the one pulled up his ass by the\nhalter, the other his hack by the bridle, and they stood still,\nwatching anxiously to see what all this would turn out to be, and found\nthat the lights were approaching them, and the nearer they came the\ngreater they seemed, at which spectacle Sancho began to shake like a\nman dosed with mercury, and Don Quixote's hair stood on end; he,\nhowever, plucking up spirit a little, said:\n\"This, no doubt, Sancho, will be a most mighty and perilous adventure,\nin which it will be needful for me to put forth all my valour and\nresolution.\"\n\"Unlucky me!\" answered Sancho; \"if this adventure happens to be one of\nphantoms, as I am beginning to think it is, where shall I find the ribs\nto bear it?\"\n\"Be they phantoms ever so much,\" said Don Quixote, \"I will not permit\nthem to touch a thread of thy garments; for if they played tricks with\nthee the time before, it was because I was unable to leap the walls of\nthe yard; but now we are on a wide plain, where I shall be able to\nwield my sword as I please.\"\n\"And if they enchant and cripple you as they did the last time,\" said\nSancho, \"what difference will it make being on the open plain or not?\"\n\"For all that,\" replied Don Quixote, \"I entreat thee, Sancho, to keep a\ngood heart, for experience will tell thee what mine is.\"\n\"I will, please God,\" answered Sancho, and the two retiring to one side\nof the road set themselves to observe closely what all these moving\nlights might be; and very soon afterwards they made out some twenty\nencamisados, all on horseback, with lighted torches in their hands, the\nawe-inspiring aspect of whom completely extinguished the courage of",

And as the\nencamisados came along they muttered to themselves in a low plaintive\ntone. This strange spectacle at such an hour and in such a solitary\nplace was quite enough to strike terror into Sancho's heart, and even\ninto his master's; and (save in Don Quixote's case) did so, for all\nSancho's resolution had now broken down. It was just the opposite with\nhis master, whose imagination immediately conjured up all this to him\nvividly as one of the adventures of his books.\nHe took it into his head that the litter was a bier on which was borne\nsome sorely wounded or slain knight, to avenge whom was a task reserved\nfor him alone; and without any further reasoning he laid his lance in\nrest, fixed himself firmly in his saddle, and with gallant spirit and\nbearing took up his position in the middle of the road where the\nencamisados must of necessity pass; and as soon as he saw them near at\nhand he raised his voice and said:\n\"Halt, knights, or whosoever ye may be, and render me account of who ye\nare, whence ye come, where ye go, what it is ye carry upon that bier,\nfor, to judge by appearances, either ye have done some wrong or some\nwrong has been done to you, and it is fitting and necessary that I\nshould know, either that I may chastise you for the evil ye have done,\nor else that I may avenge you for the injury that has been inflicted\nupon you.\"\n\"We are in haste,\" answered one of the encamisados, \"and the inn is far\noff, and we cannot stop to render you such an account as you demand;\"\nand spurring his mule he moved on.\nDon Quixote was mightily provoked by this answer, and seizing the mule\nby the bridle he said, \"Halt, and be more mannerly, and render an\naccount of what I have asked of you; else, take my defiance to combat,\nall of you.\"\nThe mule was shy, and was so frightened at her bridle being seized that\nrearing up she flung her rider to the ground over her haunches. An\nattendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse\nDon Quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his\nlance in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly\nwounded to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the\nagility with which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for\nit seemed just as if wings had that instant grown upon Rocinante, so\nlightly and proudly did he bear himself. The encamisados were all timid\nfolk and unarmed, so they speedily made their escape from the fray and\nset off at a run across the plain with their lighted torches, looking\nexactly like maskers running on some gala or festival night. The\nmourners, too, enveloped and swathed in their skirts and gowns, were\nunable to bestir themselves, and so with entire safety to himself Don\nQuixote belaboured them all and drove them off against their will, for\nthey all thought it was no man but a devil from hell come to carry away\nthe dead body they had in the litter.",

The ass is in proper trim, the\nmountains are near at hand, hunger presses, we have nothing more to do\nbut make good our retreat, and, as the saying is, the dead to the grave\nand the living to the loaf.\"\nAnd driving his ass before him he begged his master to follow, who,\nfeeling that Sancho was right, did so without replying; and after\nproceeding some little distance between two hills they found themselves\nin a wide and retired valley, where they alighted, and Sancho unloaded\nhis beast, and stretched upon the green grass, with hunger for sauce,\nthey breakfasted, dined, lunched, and supped all at once, satisfying\ntheir appetites with more than one store of cold meat which the dead\nman's clerical gentlemen (who seldom put themselves on short allowance)\nhad brought with them on their sumpter mule. But another piece of\nill-luck befell them, which Sancho held the worst of all, and that was\nthat they had no wine to drink, nor even water to moisten their lips;\nand as thirst tormented them, Sancho, observing that the meadow where\nthey were was full of green and tender grass, said what will be told in\nthe following chapter.",

Thou dost mark well, faithful and trusty squire, the\ngloom of this night, its strange silence, the dull confused murmur of\nthose trees, the awful sound of that water in quest of which we came,\nthat seems as though it were precipitating and dashing itself down from\nthe lofty mountains of the Moon, and that incessant hammering that\nwounds and pains our ears; which things all together and each of itself\nare enough to instil fear, dread, and dismay into the breast of Mars\nhimself, much more into one not used to hazards and adventures of the\nkind. Well, then, all this that I put before thee is but an incentive\nand stimulant to my spirit, making my heart burst in my bosom through\neagerness to engage in this adventure, arduous as it promises to be;\ntherefore tighten Rocinante's girths a little, and God be with thee;\nwait for me here three days and no more, and if in that time I come not\nback, thou canst return to our village, and thence, to do me a favour\nand a service, thou wilt go to El Toboso, where thou shalt say to my\nincomparable lady Dulcinea that her captive knight hath died in\nattempting things that might make him worthy of being called hers.\"\nWhen Sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the most\npathetic way, saying:\n\"Se\u00f1or, I know not why your worship wants to attempt this so dreadful\nadventure; it is night now, no one sees us here, we can easily turn\nabout and take ourselves out of danger, even if we don't drink for\nthree days to come; and as there is no one to see us, all the less will\nthere be anyone to set us down as cowards; besides, I have many a time\nheard the curate of our village, whom your worship knows well, preach\nthat he who seeks danger perishes in it; so it is not right to tempt\nGod by trying so tremendous a feat from which there can be no escape\nsave by a miracle, and Heaven has performed enough of them for your\nworship in delivering you from being blanketed as I was, and bringing\nyou out victorious and safe and sound from among all those enemies that\nwere with the dead man; and if all this does not move or soften that\nhard heart, let this thought and reflection move it, that you will have\nhardly quitted this spot when from pure fear I shall yield my soul up\nto anyone that will take it. I left home and wife and children to come\nand serve your worship, trusting to do better and not worse; but as\ncovetousness bursts the bag, it has rent my hopes asunder, for just as\nI had them highest about getting that wretched unlucky island your\nworship has so often promised me, I see that instead and in lieu of it\nyou mean to desert me now in a place so far from human reach: for God's\nsake, master mine, deal not so unjustly by me, and if your worship will\nnot entirely give up attempting this feat, at least put it off till\nmorning, for by what the lore I learned when I was a shepherd tells me\nit cannot want three hours of dawn now, because the mouth of the Horn\nis overhead and makes midnight in the line of the left arm.\"\n\"How canst thou see, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"where it makes that\nline, or where this mouth or this occiput is that thou talkest of, when\nthe night is so dark that there is not a star to be seen in the whole\nheaven?\"\n\"That's true,\" said Sancho, \"but fear has sharp eyes, and sees things\nunderground, much more above in heavens; besides, there is good reason\nto show that it now wants but little of day.\"\n\"Let it want what it may,\" replied Don Quixote, \"it shall not be said\nof me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from\ndoing what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so I beg of thee,\nSancho, to hold thy peace, for God, who has put it into my heart to\nundertake now this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care\nto watch over my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is\nto tighten Rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for I shall come\nback shortly, alive or dead.\"",

Sleep thou who art born to sleep, or do\nas thou wilt, for I will act as I think most consistent with my\ncharacter.\"\n\"Be not angry, master mine,\" replied Sancho, \"I did not mean to say\nthat;\" and coming close to him he laid one hand on the pommel of the\nsaddle and the other on the cantle so that he held his master's left\nthigh in his embrace, not daring to separate a finger's width from him;\nso much afraid was he of the strokes which still resounded with a\nregular beat.

And so in course of\ntime, the devil, who never sleeps and puts everything in confusion,\ncontrived that the love the shepherd bore the shepherdess turned into\nhatred and ill-will, and the reason, according to evil tongues, was\nsome little jealousy she caused him that crossed the line and\ntrespassed on forbidden ground; and so much did the shepherd hate her\nfrom that time forward that, in order to escape from her, he determined\nto quit the country and go where he should never set eyes on her again.\nTorralva, when she found herself spurned by Lope, was immediately\nsmitten with love for him, though she had never loved him before.\"\n\"That is the natural way of women,\" said Don Quixote, \"to scorn the one\nthat loves them, and love the one that hates them: go on, Sancho.\"\n\"It came to pass,\" said Sancho, \"that the shepherd carried out his\nintention, and driving his goats before him took his way across the\nplains of Estremadura to pass over into the Kingdom of Portugal.\nTorralva, who knew of it, went after him, and on foot and barefoot\nfollowed him at a distance, with a pilgrim's staff in her hand and a\nscrip round her neck, in which she carried, it is said, a bit of\nlooking-glass and a piece of a comb and some little pot or other of\npaint for her face; but let her carry what she did, I am not going to\ntrouble myself to prove it; all I say is, that the shepherd, they say,\ncame with his flock to cross over the river Guadiana, which was at that\ntime swollen and almost overflowing its banks, and at the spot he came\nto there was neither ferry nor boat nor anyone to carry him or his\nflock to the other side, at which he was much vexed, for he perceived\nthat Torralva was approaching and would give him great annoyance with\nher tears and entreaties; however, he went looking about so closely\nthat he discovered a fisherman who had alongside of him a boat so small\nthat it could only hold one person and one goat; but for all that he\nspoke to him and agreed with him to carry himself and his three hundred\ngoats across. The fisherman got into the boat and carried one goat\nover; he came back and carried another over; he came back again, and\nagain brought over another\u2014let your worship keep count of the goats the\nfisherman is taking across, for if one escapes the memory there will be\nan end of the story, and it will be impossible to tell another word of\nit. To proceed, I must tell you the landing place on the other side was\nmiry and slippery, and the fisherman lost a great deal of time in going\nand coming; still he returned for another goat, and another, and\nanother.\"\n\"Take it for granted he brought them all across,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"and don't keep going and coming in this way, or thou wilt not make an\nend of bringing them over this twelvemonth.\"\n\"How many have gone across so far?\" said Sancho.\n\"How the devil do I know?\" replied Don Quixote.\n\"There it is,\" said Sancho, \"what I told you, that you must keep a good\ncount; well then, by God, there is an end of the story, for there is no\ngoing any farther.\"\n\"How can that be?\" said Don Quixote; \"is it so essential to the story\nto know to a nicety the goats that have crossed over, that if there be\na mistake of one in the reckoning, thou canst not go on with it?\"\n\"No, se\u00f1or, not a bit,\" replied Sancho; \"for when I asked your worship\nto tell me how many goats had crossed, and you answered you did not\nknow, at that very instant all I had to say passed away out of my\nmemory, and, faith, there was much virtue in it, and entertainment.\"\n\"So, then,\" said Don Quixote, \"the story has come to an end?\"\n\"As much as my mother has,\" said Sancho.\n\"In truth,\" said Don Quixote, \"thou hast told one of the rarest\nstories, tales, or histories, that anyone in the world could have\nimagined, and such a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor\nwill be in a lifetime; though I expected nothing else from thy\nexcellent understanding. But I do not wonder, for perhaps those\nceaseless strokes may have confused thy wits.\"\n\"All that may be,\" replied Sancho, \"but I know that as to my story, all\nthat can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count\nof the passage of the goats begins.\"\n\"Let it end where it will, well and good,\" said Don Quixote, \"and let",

Sancho glanced at him and saw him with his head bent\ndown upon his breast in manifest mortification; and Don Quixote glanced\nat Sancho and saw him with his cheeks puffed out and his mouth full of\nlaughter, and evidently ready to explode with it, and in spite of his\nvexation he could not help laughing at the sight of him; and when\nSancho saw his master begin he let go so heartily that he had to hold\nhis sides with both hands to keep himself from bursting with laughter.\nFour times he stopped, and as many times did his laughter break out\nafresh with the same violence as at first, whereat Don Quixote grew\nfurious, above all when he heard him say mockingly, \"Thou must know,\nfriend Sancho, that of Heaven's will I was born in this our iron age to\nrevive in it the golden or age of gold; I am he for whom are reserved\nperils, mighty achievements, valiant deeds;\" and here he went on\nrepeating the words that Don Quixote uttered the first time they heard\nthe awful strokes.\nDon Quixote, then, seeing that Sancho was turning him into ridicule,\nwas so mortified and vexed that he lifted up his pike and smote him two\nsuch blows that if, instead of catching them on his shoulders, he had\ncaught them on his head there would have been no wages to pay, unless\nindeed to his heirs. Sancho seeing that he was getting an awkward\nreturn in earnest for his jest, and fearing his master might carry it\nstill further, said to him very humbly, \"Calm yourself, sir, for by God\nI am only joking.\"\n\"Well, then, if you are joking I am not,\" replied Don Quixote. \"Look\nhere, my lively gentleman, if these, instead of being fulling hammers,\nhad been some perilous adventure, have I not, think you, shown the\ncourage required for the attempt and achievement? Am I, perchance,\nbeing, as I am, a gentleman, bound to know and distinguish sounds and\ntell whether they come from fulling mills or not; and that, when\nperhaps, as is the case, I have never in my life seen any as you have,\nlow boor as you are, that have been born and bred among them? But turn\nme these six hammers into six giants, and bring them to beard me, one\nby one or all together, and if I do not knock them head over heels,\nthen make what mockery you like of me.\"\n\"No more of that, se\u00f1or,\" returned Sancho; \"I own I went a little too\nfar with the joke. But tell me, your worship, now that peace is made\nbetween us (and may God bring you out of all the adventures that may\nbefall you as safe and sound as he has brought you out of this one),\nwas it not a thing to laugh at, and is it not a good story, the great\nfear we were in?\u2014at least that I was in; for as to your worship I see\nnow that you neither know nor understand what either fear or dismay\nis.\"\n\"I do not deny,\" said Don Quixote, \"that what happened to us may be\nworth laughing at, but it is not worth making a story about, for it is\nnot everyone that is shrewd enough to hit the right point of a thing.\"\n\"At any rate,\" said Sancho, \"your worship knew how to hit the right\npoint with your pike, aiming at my head and hitting me on the\nshoulders, thanks be to God and my own smartness in dodging it. But let\nthat pass; all will come out in the scouring; for I have heard say 'he\nloves thee well that makes thee weep;' and moreover that it is the way\nwith great lords after any hard words they give a servant to give him a\npair of breeches; though I do not know what they give after blows,\nunless it be that knights-errant after blows give islands, or kingdoms\non the mainland.\"\n\"It may be on the dice,\" said Don Quixote, \"that all thou sayest will\ncome true; overlook the past, for thou art shrewd enough to know that\nour first movements are not in our own control; and one thing for the\nfuture bear in mind, that thou curb and restrain thy loquacity in my\ncompany; for in all the books of chivalry that I have read, and they\nare innumerable, I never met with a squire who talked so much to his\nlord as thou dost to thine; and in fact I feel it to be a great fault\nof thine and of mine: of thine, that thou hast so little respect for\nme; of mine, that I do not make myself more respected. There was\nGandalin, the squire of Amadis of Gaul, that was Count of the Insula\nFirme, and we read of him that he always addressed his lord with his\ncap in his hand, his head bowed down and his body bent double, more\nturquesco. And then, what shall we say of Gasabal, the squire of\nGalaor, who was so silent that in order to indicate to us the greatness\nof his marvellous taciturnity his name is only once mentioned in the\nwhole of that history, as long as it is truthful? From all I have said\nthou wilt gather, Sancho, that there must be a difference between\nmaster and man, between lord and lackey, between knight and squire: so\nthat from this day forward in our intercourse we must observe more\nrespect and take less liberties, for in whatever way I may be provoked\nwith you it will be bad for the pitcher. The favours and benefits that\nI have promised you will come in due time, and if they do not your\nwages at least will not be lost, as I have already told you.\"\n\"All that your worship says is very well,\" said Sancho, \"but I should\nlike to know (in case the time of favours should not come, and it might\nbe necessary to fall back upon wages) how much did the squire of a\nknight-errant get in those days, and did they agree by the month, or by\nthe day like bricklayers?\"\n\"I do not believe,\" replied Don Quixote, \"that such squires were ever\non wages, but were dependent on favour; and if I have now mentioned\nthine in the sealed will I have left at home, it was with a view to\nwhat may happen; for as yet I know not how chivalry will turn out in\nthese wretched times of ours, and I do not wish my soul to suffer for\ntrifles in the other world; for I would have thee know, Sancho, that in\nthis there is no condition more hazardous than that of adventurers.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Sancho, \"since the mere noise of the hammers of a\nfulling mill can disturb and disquiet the heart of such a valiant\nerrant adventurer as your worship; but you may be sure I will not open\nmy lips henceforward to make light of anything of your worship's, but\nonly to honour you as my master and natural lord.\"\n\"By so doing,\" replied Don Quixote, \"shalt thou live long on the face\nof the earth; for next to parents, masters are to be respected as\nthough they were parents.\"\nc19e.jpg (33K)",

In that neighbourhood there were two\nvillages, one of them so small that it had neither apothecary's shop\nnor barber, which the other that was close to it had, so the barber of\nthe larger served the smaller, and in it there was a sick man who\nrequired to be bled and another man who wanted to be shaved, and on\nthis errand the barber was going, carrying with him a brass basin; but\nas luck would have it, as he was on the way it began to rain, and not\nto spoil his hat, which probably was a new one, he put the basin on his\nhead, and being clean it glittered at half a league's distance. He rode\nupon a grey ass, as Sancho said, and this was what made it seem to Don\nQuixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a knight and a golden helmet; for\neverything he saw he made to fall in with his crazy chivalry and\nill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor knight draw near, without\nentering into any parley with him, at Rocinante's top speed he bore\ndown upon him with the pike pointed low, fully determined to run him\nthrough and through, and as he reached him, without checking the fury\nof his charge, he cried to him:\n\"Defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that\nwhich is so reasonably my due.\"\nThe barber, who without any expectation or apprehension of it saw this\napparition coming down upon him, had no other way of saving himself\nfrom the stroke of the lance but to let himself fall off his ass; and\nno sooner had he touched the ground than he sprang up more nimbly than\na deer and sped away across the plain faster than the wind.\nHe left the basin on the ground, with which Don Quixote contented\nhimself, saying that the pagan had shown his discretion and imitated\nthe beaver, which finding itself pressed by the hunters bites and cuts\noff with its teeth that for which, by its natural instinct, it knows it\nis pursued.\nHe told Sancho to pick up the helmet, and he taking it in his hands\nsaid:\n\"By God the basin is a good one, and worth a real of eight if it is\nworth a maravedis,\" and handed it to his master, who immediately put it\non his head, turning it round, now this way, now that, in search of",

'This,' they will say, 'is he who\nvanquished in single combat the gigantic Brocabruno of mighty strength;\nhe who delivered the great Mameluke of Persia out of the long\nenchantment under which he had been for almost nine hundred years.' So\nfrom one to another they will go proclaiming his achievements; and\npresently at the tumult of the boys and the others the king of that\nkingdom will appear at the windows of his royal palace, and as soon as\nhe beholds the knight, recognising him by his arms and the device on\nhis shield, he will as a matter of course say, 'What ho! Forth all ye,\nthe knights of my court, to receive the flower of chivalry who cometh\nhither!' At which command all will issue forth, and he himself,\nadvancing half-way down the stairs, will embrace him closely, and\nsalute him, kissing him on the cheek, and will then lead him to the\nqueen's chamber, where the knight will find her with the princess her\ndaughter, who will be one of the most beautiful and accomplished\ndamsels that could with the utmost pains be discovered anywhere in the\nknown world. Straightway it will come to pass that she will fix her\neyes upon the knight and he his upon her, and each will seem to the\nother something more divine than human, and, without knowing how or why\nthey will be taken and entangled in the inextricable toils of love, and\nsorely distressed in their hearts not to see any way of making their\npains and sufferings known by speech. Thence they will lead him, no\ndoubt, to some richly adorned chamber of the palace, where, having\nremoved his armour, they will bring him a rich mantle of scarlet\nwherewith to robe himself, and if he looked noble in his armour he will\nlook still more so in a doublet. When night comes he will sup with the\nking, queen, and princess; and all the time he will never take his eyes\noff her, stealing stealthy glances, unnoticed by those present, and she\nwill do the same, and with equal cautiousness, being, as I have said, a\ndamsel of great discretion. The tables being removed, suddenly through\nthe door of the hall there will enter a hideous and diminutive dwarf\nfollowed by a fair dame, between two giants, who comes with a certain\nadventure, the work of an ancient sage; and he who shall achieve it\nshall be deemed the best knight in the world.\n\"The king will then command all those present to essay it, and none\nwill bring it to an end and conclusion save the stranger knight, to the\ngreat enhancement of his fame, whereat the princess will be overjoyed\nand will esteem herself happy and fortunate in having fixed and placed\nher thoughts so high. And the best of it is that this king, or prince,\nor whatever he is, is engaged in a very bitter war with another as\npowerful as himself, and the stranger knight, after having been some\ndays at his court, requests leave from him to go and serve him in the\nsaid war. The king will grant it very readily, and the knight will\ncourteously kiss his hands for the favour done to him; and that night\nhe will take leave of his lady the princess at the grating of the\nchamber where she sleeps, which looks upon a garden, and at which he\nhas already many times conversed with her, the go-between and\nconfidante in the matter being a damsel much trusted by the princess.\nHe will sigh, she will swoon, the damsel will fetch water, much\ndistressed because morning approaches, and for the honour of her lady\nhe would not that they were discovered; at last the princess will come\nto herself and will present her white hands through the grating to the\nknight, who will kiss them a thousand and a thousand times, bathing\nthem with his tears. It will be arranged between them how they are to\ninform each other of their good or evil fortunes, and the princess will\nentreat him to make his absence as short as possible, which he will\npromise to do with many oaths; once more he kisses her hands, and takes\nhis leave in such grief that he is well-nigh ready to die. He betakes\nhim thence to his chamber, flings himself on his bed, cannot sleep for\nsorrow at parting, rises early in the morning, goes to take leave of\nthe king, queen, and princess, and, as he takes his leave of the pair,\nit is told him that the princess is indisposed and cannot receive a\nvisit; the knight thinks it is from grief at his departure, his heart\nis pierced, and he is hardly able to keep from showing his pain. The\nconfidante is present, observes all, goes to tell her mistress, who\nlistens with tears and says that one of her greatest distresses is not\nknowing who this knight is, and whether he is of kingly lineage or not;\nthe damsel assures her that so much courtesy, gentleness, and gallantry\nof bearing as her knight possesses could not exist in any save one who\nwas royal and illustrious; her anxiety is thus relieved, and she\nstrives to be of good cheer lest she should excite suspicion in her\nparents, and at the end of two days she appears in public. Meanwhile\nthe knight has taken his departure; he fights in the war, conquers the\nking's enemy, wins many cities, triumphs in many battles, returns to\nthe court, sees his lady where he was wont to see her, and it is agreed\nthat he shall demand her in marriage of her parents as the reward of\nhis services; the king is unwilling to give her, as he knows not who he\nis, but nevertheless, whether carried off or in whatever other way it\nmay be, the princess comes to be his bride, and her father comes to\nregard it as very good fortune; for it so happens that this knight is\nproved to be the son of a valiant king of some kingdom, I know not\nwhat, for I fancy it is not likely to be on the map. The father dies,\nthe princess inherits, and in two words the knight becomes king. And\nhere comes in at once the bestowal of rewards upon his squire and all\nwho have aided him in rising to so exalted a rank. He marries his\nsquire to a damsel of the princess's, who will be, no doubt, the one\nwho was confidante in their amour, and is daughter of a very great\nduke.\"\n\"That's what I want, and no mistake about it!\" said Sancho. \"That's\nwhat I'm waiting for; for all this, word for word, is in store for your\nworship under the title of the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\"\n\"Thou needst not doubt it, Sancho,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for in the\nsame manner, and by the same steps as I have described here,\nknights-errant rise and have risen to be kings and emperors; all we\nwant now is to find out what king, Christian or pagan, is at war and\nhas a beautiful daughter; but there will be time enough to think of\nthat, for, as I have told thee, fame must be won in other quarters\nbefore repairing to the court. There is another thing, too, that is\nwanting; for supposing we find a king who is at war and has a beautiful\ndaughter, and that I have won incredible fame throughout the universe,\nI know not how it can be made out that I am of royal lineage, or even\nsecond cousin to an emperor; for the king will not be willing to give\nme his daughter in marriage unless he is first thoroughly satisfied on\nthis point, however much my famous deeds may deserve it; so that by\nthis deficiency I fear I shall lose what my arm has fairly earned. True\nit is I am a gentleman of known house, of estate and property, and\nentitled to the five hundred sueldos mulet; and it may be that the sage\nwho shall write my history will so clear up my ancestry and pedigree\nthat I may find myself fifth or sixth in descent from a king; for I\nwould have thee know, Sancho, that there are two kinds of lineages in\nthe world; some there be tracing and deriving their descent from kings\nand princes, whom time has reduced little by little until they end in a\npoint like a pyramid upside down; and others who spring from the common\nherd and go on rising step by step until they come to be great lords;\nso that the difference is that the one were what they no longer are,\nand the others are what they formerly were not. And I may be of such\nthat after investigation my origin may prove great and famous, with\nwhich the king, my father-in-law that is to be, ought to be satisfied;\nand should he not be, the princess will so love me that even though she\nwell knew me to be the son of a water-carrier, she will take me for her\nlord and husband in spite of her father; if not, then it comes to\nseizing her and carrying her off where I please; for time or death will\nput an end to the wrath of her parents.\"\n\"It comes to this, too,\" said Sancho, \"what some naughty people say,\n'Never ask as a favour what thou canst take by force;' though it would\nfit better to say, 'A clear escape is better than good men's prayers.'\nI say so because if my lord the king, your worship's father-in-law,\nwill not condescend to give you my lady the princess, there is nothing\nfor it but, as your worship says, to seize her and transport her. But\nthe mischief is that until peace is made and you come into the peaceful\nenjoyment of your kingdom, the poor squire is famishing as far as\nrewards go, unless it be that the confidante damsel that is to be his\nwife comes with the princess, and that with her he tides over his bad\nluck until Heaven otherwise orders things; for his master, I suppose,\nmay as well give her to him at once for a lawful wife.\"\n\"Nobody can object to that,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Then since that may be,\" said Sancho, \"there is nothing for it but to\ncommend ourselves to God, and let fortune take what course it will.\"\n\"God guide it according to my wishes and thy wants,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"and mean be he who thinks himself mean.\"\n\"In God's name let him be so,\" said Sancho: \"I am an old Christian, and\nto fit me for a count that's enough.\"\n\"And more than enough for thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"and even wert thou\nnot, it would make no difference, because I being the king can easily\ngive thee nobility without purchase or service rendered by thee, for\nwhen I make thee a count, then thou art at once a gentleman; and they\nmay say what they will, but by my faith they will have to call thee\n'your lordship,' whether they like it or not.\"\n\"Not a doubt of it; and I'll know how to support the tittle,\" said\nSancho.\n\"Title thou shouldst say, not tittle,\" said his master.\n\"So be it,\" answered Sancho. \"I say I will know how to behave, for once\nin my life I was beadle of a brotherhood, and the beadle's gown sat so\nwell on me that all said I looked as if I was to be steward of the same\nbrotherhood. What will it be, then, when I put a duke's robe on my\nback, or dress myself in gold and pearls like a count? I believe\nthey'll come a hundred leagues to see me.\"\n\"Thou wilt look well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must shave thy beard\noften, for thou hast it so thick and rough and unkempt, that if thou\ndost not shave it every second day at least, they will see what thou\nart at the distance of a musket shot.\"\n\"What more will it be,\" said Sancho, \"than having a barber, and keeping\nhim at wages in the house? and even if it be necessary, I will make him\ngo behind me like a nobleman's equerry.\"\n\"Why, how dost thou know that noblemen have equerries behind them?\"\nasked Don Quixote.\n\"I will tell you,\" answered Sancho. \"Years ago I was for a month at the\ncapital and there I saw taking the air a very small gentleman who they\nsaid was a very great man, and a man following him on horseback in\nevery turn he took, just as if he was his tail. I asked why this man\ndid not join the other man, instead of always going behind him; they\nanswered me that he was his equerry, and that it was the custom with\nnobles to have such persons behind them, and ever since then I know it,\nfor I have never forgotten it.\"\n\"Thou art right,\" said Don Quixote, \"and in the same way thou mayest\ncarry thy barber with thee, for customs did not come into use all\ntogether, nor were they all invented at once, and thou mayest be the\nfirst count to have a barber to follow him; and, indeed, shaving one's\nbeard is a greater trust than saddling one's horse.\"\n\"Let the barber business be my look-out,\" said Sancho; \"and your\nworship's be it to strive to become a king, and make me a count.\"\n\"So it shall be,\" answered Don Quixote, and raising his eyes he saw",

But God is great; patience\u2014there, that's\nenough of it.\"\nDon Quixote passed on to the fourth, a man of venerable aspect with a\nwhite beard falling below his breast, who on hearing himself asked the\nreason of his being there began to weep without answering a word, but\nthe fifth acted as his tongue and said, \"This worthy man is going to\nthe galleys for four years, after having gone the rounds in ceremony\nand on horseback.\"\n\"That means,\" said Sancho Panza, \"as I take it, to have been exposed to\nshame in public.\"\n\"Just so,\" replied the galley slave, \"and the offence for which they\ngave him that punishment was having been an ear-broker, nay\nbody-broker; I mean, in short, that this gentleman goes as a pimp, and\nfor having besides a certain touch of the sorcerer about him.\"\n\"If that touch had not been thrown in,\" said Don Quixote, \"he would not\ndeserve, for mere pimping, to row in the galleys, but rather to command\nand be admiral of them; for the office of pimp is no ordinary one,\nbeing the office of persons of discretion, one very necessary in a\nwell-ordered state, and only to be exercised by persons of good birth;\nnay, there ought to be an inspector and overseer of them, as in other\noffices, and recognised number, as with the brokers on change; in this\nway many of the evils would be avoided which are caused by this office\nand calling being in the hands of stupid and ignorant people, such as\nwomen more or less silly, and pages and jesters of little standing and\nexperience, who on the most urgent occasions, and when ingenuity of\ncontrivance is needed, let the crumbs freeze on the way to their\nmouths, and know not which is their right hand. I should like to go\nfarther, and give reasons to show that it is advisable to choose those\nwho are to hold so necessary an office in the state, but this is not\nthe fit place for it; some day I will expound the matter to someone\nable to see to and rectify it; all I say now is, that the additional\nfact of his being a sorcerer has removed the sorrow it gave me to see\nthese white hairs and this venerable countenance in so painful a\nposition on account of his being a pimp; though I know well there are\nno sorceries in the world that can move or compel the will as some\nsimple folk fancy, for our will is free, nor is there herb or charm\nthat can force it. All that certain silly women and quacks do is to\nturn men mad with potions and poisons, pretending that they have power\nto cause love, for, as I say, it is an impossibility to compel the\nwill.\"\n\"It is true,\" said the good old man, \"and indeed, sir, as far as the\ncharge of sorcery goes I was not guilty; as to that of being a pimp I\ncannot deny it; but I never thought I was doing any harm by it, for my\nonly object was that all the world should enjoy itself and live in\npeace and quiet, without quarrels or troubles; but my good intentions\nwere unavailing to save me from going where I never expect to come back\nfrom, with this weight of years upon me and a urinary ailment that\nnever gives me a moment's ease;\" and again he fell to weeping as\nbefore, and such compassion did Sancho feel for him that he took out a\nreal of four from his bosom and gave it to him in alms.",

If\nyou, sir, have anything wherewith to help the poor, God will repay it\nto you in heaven, and we on earth will take care in our petitions to\nhim to pray for the life and health of your worship, that they may be\nas long and as good as your amiable appearance deserves.\"\nThis one was in the dress of a student, and one of the guards said he\nwas a great talker and a very elegant Latin scholar.\nBehind all these there came a man of thirty, a very personable fellow,\nexcept that when he looked, his eyes turned in a little one towards the\nother. He was bound differently from the rest, for he had to his leg a\nchain so long that it was wound all round his body, and two rings on\nhis neck, one attached to the chain, the other to what they call a\n\"keep-friend\" or \"friend's foot,\" from which hung two irons reaching to\nhis waist with two manacles fixed to them in which his hands were\nsecured by a big padlock, so that he could neither raise his hands to\nhis mouth nor lower his head to his hands. Don Quixote asked why this\nman carried so many more chains than the others. The guard replied that\nit was because he alone had committed more crimes than all the rest put\ntogether, and was so daring and such a villain, that though they\nmarched him in that fashion they did not feel sure of him, but were in\ndread of his making his escape.\n\"What crimes can he have committed,\" said Don Quixote, \"if they have\nnot deserved a heavier punishment than being sent to the galleys?\"\n\"He goes for ten years,\" replied the guard, \"which is the same thing as\ncivil death, and all that need be said is that this good fellow is the\nfamous Gines de Pasamonte, otherwise called Ginesillo de Parapilla.\"\n\"Gently, se\u00f1or commissary,\" said the galley slave at this, \"let us have\nno fixing of names or surnames; my name is Gines, not Ginesillo, and my\nfamily name is Pasamonte, not Parapilla as you say; let each one mind\nhis own business, and he will be doing enough.\"\n\"Speak with less impertinence, master thief of extra measure,\" replied\nthe commissary, \"if you don't want me to make you hold your tongue in\nspite of your teeth.\"\n\"It is easy to see,\" returned the galley slave, \"that man goes as God\npleases, but someone shall know some day whether I am called Ginesillo\nde Parapilla or not.\"\n\"Don't they call you so, you liar?\" said the guard.\n\"They do,\" returned Gines, \"but I will make them give over calling me\nso, or I will be shaved, where, I only say behind my teeth. If you,\nsir, have anything to give us, give it to us at once, and God speed\nyou, for you are becoming tiresome with all this inquisitiveness about\nthe lives of others; if you want to know about mine, let me tell you I\nam Gines de Pasamonte, whose life is written by these fingers.\"\n\"He says true,\" said the commissary, \"for he has himself written his\nstory as grand as you please, and has left the book in the prison in\npawn for two hundred reals.\"\n\"And I mean to take it out of pawn,\" said Gines, \"though it were in for\ntwo hundred ducats.\"\n\"Is it so good?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"So good is it,\" replied Gines, \"that a fig for 'Lazarillo de Tormes,'\nand all of that kind that have been written, or shall be written\ncompared with it: all I will say about it is that it deals with facts,\nand facts so neat and diverting that no lies could match them.\"\n\"And how is the book entitled?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"The 'Life of Gines de Pasamonte,'\" replied the subject of it.\n\"And is it finished?\" asked Don Quixote.\n\"How can it be finished,\" said the other, \"when my life is not yet\nfinished? All that is written is from my birth down to the point when\nthey sent me to the galleys this last time.\"\n\"Then you have been there before?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"In the service of God and the king I have been there for four years\nbefore now, and I know by this time what the biscuit and courbash are\nlike,\" replied Gines; \"and it is no great grievance to me to go back to\nthem, for there I shall have time to finish my book; I have still many\nthings left to say, and in the galleys of Spain there is more than\nenough leisure; though I do not want much for what I have to write, for\nI have it by heart.\"\n\"You seem a clever fellow,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"And an unfortunate one,\" replied Gines, \"for misfortune always\npersecutes good wit.\"\n\"It persecutes rogues,\" said the commissary.\n\"I told you already to go gently, master commissary,\" said Pasamonte;\n\"their lordships yonder never gave you that staff to ill-treat us\nwretches here, but to conduct and take us where his majesty orders you;\nif not, by the life of\u2014never mind\u2014; it may be that some day the stains\nmade in the inn will come out in the scouring; let everyone hold his\ntongue and behave well and speak better; and now let us march on, for\nwe have had quite enough of this entertainment.\"\nThe commissary lifted his staff to strike Pasamonte in return for his\nthreats, but Don Quixote came between them, and begged him not to\nill-use him, as it was not too much to allow one who had his hands tied\nto have his tongue a trifle free; and turning to the whole chain of\nthem he said:\n\"From all you have told me, dear brethren, I make out clearly that\nthough they have punished you for your faults, the punishments you are\nabout to endure do not give you much pleasure, and that you go to them\nvery much against the grain and against your will, and that perhaps\nthis one's want of courage under torture, that one's want of money, the\nother's want of advocacy, and lastly the perverted judgment of the\njudge may have been the cause of your ruin and of your failure to\nobtain the justice you had on your side. All which presents itself now\nto my mind, urging, persuading, and even compelling me to demonstrate\nin your case the purpose for which Heaven sent me into the world and\ncaused me to make profession of the order of chivalry to which I\nbelong, and the vow I took therein to give aid to those in need and\nunder the oppression of the strong. But as I know that it is a mark of\nprudence not to do by foul means what may be done by fair, I will ask\nthese gentlemen, the guards and commissary, to be so good as to release\nyou and let you go in peace, as there will be no lack of others to\nserve the king under more favourable circumstances; for it seems to me\na hard case to make slaves of those whom God and nature have made free.\nMoreover, sirs of the guard,\" added Don Quixote, \"these poor fellows\nhave done nothing to you; let each answer for his own sins yonder;\nthere is a God in Heaven who will not forget to punish the wicked or\nreward the good; and it is not fitting that honest men should be the\ninstruments of punishment to others, they being therein no way\nconcerned. This request I make thus gently and quietly, that, if you\ncomply with it, I may have reason for thanking you; and, if you will\nnot voluntarily, this lance and sword together with the might of my arm\nshall compel you to comply with it by force.\"\n\"Nice nonsense!\" said the commissary; \"a fine piece of pleasantry he\nhas come out with at last! He wants us to let the king's prisoners go,\nas if we had any authority to release them, or he to order us to do so!\nGo your way, sir, and good luck to you; put that basin straight that\nyou've got on your head, and don't go looking for three feet on a cat.\"\n\"'Tis you that are the cat, rat, and rascal,\" replied Don Quixote, and\nacting on the word he fell upon him so suddenly that without giving him\ntime to defend himself he brought him to the ground sorely wounded with",

The other guards stood thunderstruck and amazed at this\nunexpected event, but recovering presence of mind, those on horseback\nseized their swords, and those on foot their javelins, and attacked Don\nQuixote, who was waiting for them with great calmness; and no doubt it\nwould have gone badly with him if the galley slaves, seeing the chance\nbefore them of liberating themselves, had not effected it by contriving\nto break the chain on which they were strung. Such was the confusion,\nthat the guards, now rushing at the galley slaves who were breaking\nloose, now to attack Don Quixote who was waiting for them, did nothing\nat all that was of any use. Sancho, on his part, gave a helping hand to\nrelease Gines de Pasamonte, who was the first to leap forth upon the\nplain free and unfettered, and who, attacking the prostrate commissary,\ntook from him his sword and the musket, with which, aiming at one and\nlevelling at another, he, without ever discharging it, drove every one\nof the guards off the field, for they took to flight, as well to escape\nPasamonte's musket, as the showers of stones the now released galley\nslaves were raining upon them. Sancho was greatly grieved at the\naffair, because he anticipated that those who had fled would report the\nmatter to the Holy Brotherhood, who at the summons of the alarm-bell\nwould at once sally forth in quest of the offenders; and he said so to\nhis master, and entreated him to leave the place at once, and go into\nhiding in the sierra that was close by.\n\"That is all very well,\" said Don Quixote, \"but I know what must be\ndone now;\" and calling together all the galley slaves, who were now\nrunning riot, and had stripped the commissary to the skin, he collected\nthem round him to hear what he had to say, and addressed them as\nfollows: \"To be grateful for benefits received is the part of persons\nof good birth, and one of the sins most offensive to God is\ningratitude; I say so because, sirs, ye have already seen by manifest\nproof the benefit ye have received of me; in return for which I desire,\nand it is my good pleasure that, laden with that chain which I have\ntaken off your necks, ye at once set out and proceed to the city of El\nToboso, and there present yourselves before the lady Dulcinea del\nToboso, and say to her that her knight, he of the Rueful Countenance,\nsends to commend himself to her; and that ye recount to her in full\ndetail all the particulars of this notable adventure, up to the\nrecovery of your longed-for liberty; and this done ye may go where ye\nwill, and good fortune attend you.\"\nGines de Pasamonte made answer for all, saying, \"That which you, sir,\nour deliverer, demand of us, is of all impossibilities the most\nimpossible to comply with, because we cannot go together along the\nroads, but only singly and separate, and each one his own way,\nendeavouring to hide ourselves in the bowels of the earth to escape the\nHoly Brotherhood, which, no doubt, will come out in search of us. What\nyour worship may do, and fairly do, is to change this service and\ntribute as regards the lady Dulcinea del Toboso for a certain quantity\nof ave-marias and credos which we will say for your worship's\nintention, and this is a condition that can be complied with by night\nas by day, running or resting, in peace or in war; but to imagine that\nwe are going now to return to the flesh-pots of Egypt, I mean to take\nup our chain and set out for El Toboso, is to imagine that it is now\nnight, though it is not yet ten in the morning, and to ask this of us\nis like asking pears of the elm tree.\"\n\"Then by all that's good,\" said Don Quixote (now stirred to wrath),\n\"Don son of a bitch, Don Ginesillo de Paropillo, or whatever your name\nis, you will have to go yourself alone, with your tail between your\nlegs and the whole chain on your back.\"\nPasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly\nconvinced that Don Quixote was not quite right in his head as he had\ncommitted such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in\nthis fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they\nbegan to shower stones on Don Quixote at such a rate that he was quite\nunable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor Rocinante no more\nheeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. Sancho planted\nhimself behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the\nhailstorm that poured on both of them. Don Quixote was unable to shield\nhimself so well but that more pebbles than I could count struck him\nfull on the body with such force that they brought him to the ground;\nand the instant he fell the student pounced upon him, snatched the\nbasin from his head, and with it struck three or four blows on his\nshoulders, and as many more on the ground, knocking it almost to\npieces. They then stripped him of a jacket that he wore over his\narmour, and they would have stripped off his stockings if his greaves\nhad not prevented them. From Sancho they took his coat, leaving him in\nhis shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves the remaining spoils\nof the battle, they went each one his own way, more solicitous about\nkeeping clear of the Holy Brotherhood they dreaded, than about\nburdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves\nbefore the lady Dulcinea del Toboso. The ass and Rocinante, Sancho and\nDon Quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with\ndrooping head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he\nthought the storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over;\nRocinante stretched beside his master, for he too had been brought to\nthe ground by a stone; Sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the\nHoly Brotherhood; and Don Quixote fuming to find himself so served by\nthe very persons for whom he had done so much.",

He was encouraged in this by perceiving that the stock\nof provisions carried by the ass had come safe out of the fray with the\ngalley slaves, a circumstance that he regarded as a miracle, seeing how\nthey pillaged and ransacked.",

What thy\nbeauty raised up thy deeds have laid low; by it I believed thee to be\nan angel, by them I know thou art a woman. Peace be with thee who hast\nsent war to me, and Heaven grant that the deceit of thy husband be ever\nhidden from thee, so that thou repent not of what thou hast done, and I\nreap not a revenge I would not have.\nWhen he had finished the letter, Don Quixote said, \"There is less to be\ngathered from this than from the verses, except that he who wrote it is\nsome rejected lover;\" and turning over nearly all the pages of the book\nhe found more verses and letters, some of which he could read, while\nothers he could not; but they were all made up of complaints, laments,\nmisgivings, desires and aversions, favours and rejections, some\nrapturous, some doleful. While Don Quixote examined the book, Sancho\nexamined the valise, not leaving a corner in the whole of it or in the\npad that he did not search, peer into, and explore, or seam that he did\nnot rip, or tuft of wool that he did not pick to pieces, lest anything\nshould escape for want of care and pains; so keen was the covetousness",

Don Quixote\ncalled aloud to him and begged him to come down to where they stood. He\nshouted in return, asking what had brought them to that spot, seldom or\nnever trodden except by the feet of goats, or of the wolves and other\nwild beasts that roamed around. Sancho in return bade him come down,\nand they would explain all to him.\nThe goatherd descended, and reaching the place where Don Quixote stood,\nhe said, \"I will wager you are looking at that hack mule that lies dead\nin the hollow there, and, faith, it has been lying there now these six\nmonths; tell me, have you come upon its master about here?\"\n\"We have come upon nobody,\" answered Don Quixote, \"nor on anything\nexcept a saddle-pad and a little valise that we found not far from\nthis.\"\n\"I found it too,\" said the goatherd, \"but I would not lift it nor go\nnear it for fear of some ill-luck or being charged with theft, for the\ndevil is crafty, and things rise up under one's feet to make one fall\nwithout knowing why or wherefore.\"\n\"That's exactly what I say,\" said Sancho; \"I found it too, and I would\nnot go within a stone's throw of it; there I left it, and there it lies\njust as it was, for I don't want a dog with a bell.\"\n\"Tell me, good man,\" said Don Quixote, \"do you know who is the owner of\nthis property?\"\n\"All I can tell you,\" said the goatherd, \"is that about six months ago,\nmore or less, there arrived at a shepherd's hut three leagues, perhaps,\naway from this, a youth of well-bred appearance and manners, mounted on\nthat same mule which lies dead here, and with the same saddle-pad and\nvalise which you say you found and did not touch. He asked us what part\nof this sierra was the most rugged and retired; we told him that it was\nwhere we now are; and so in truth it is, for if you push on half a\nleague farther, perhaps you will not be able to find your way out; and\nI am wondering how you have managed to come here, for there is no road\nor path that leads to this spot. I say, then, that on hearing our\nanswer the youth turned about and made for the place we pointed out to\nhim, leaving us all charmed with his good looks, and wondering at his\nquestion and the haste with which we saw him depart in the direction of\nthe sierra; and after that we saw him no more, until some days\nafterwards he crossed the path of one of our shepherds, and without\nsaying a word to him, came up to him and gave him several cuffs and\nkicks, and then turned to the ass with our provisions and took all the\nbread and cheese it carried, and having done this made off back again\ninto the sierra with extraordinary swiftness. When some of us goatherds\nlearned this we went in search of him for about two days through the\nmost remote portion of this sierra, at the end of which we found him\nlodged in the hollow of a large thick cork tree. He came out to meet us\nwith great gentleness, with his dress now torn and his face so\ndisfigured and burned by the sun, that we hardly recognised him but\nthat his clothes, though torn, convinced us, from the recollection we\nhad of them, that he was the person we were looking for. He saluted us\ncourteously, and in a few well-spoken words he told us not to wonder at\nseeing him going about in this guise, as it was binding upon him in\norder that he might work out a penance which for his many sins had been\nimposed upon him. We asked him to tell us who he was, but we were never\nable to find out from him: we begged of him too, when he was in want of\nfood, which he could not do without, to tell us where we should find\nhim, as we would bring it to him with all good-will and readiness; or\nif this were not to his taste, at least to come and ask it of us and\nnot take it by force from the shepherds. He thanked us for the offer,\nbegged pardon for the late assault, and promised for the future to ask\nit in God's name without offering violence to anybody. As for fixed\nabode, he said he had no other than that which chance offered wherever\nnight might overtake him; and his words ended in an outburst of weeping\nso bitter that we who listened to him must have been very stones had we\nnot joined him in it, comparing what we saw of him the first time with\nwhat we saw now; for, as I said, he was a graceful and gracious youth,\nand in his courteous and polished language showed himself to be of good\nbirth and courtly breeding, and rustics as we were that listened to\nhim, even to our rusticity his gentle bearing sufficed to make it\nplain.\n\"But in the midst of his conversation he stopped and became silent,\nkeeping his eyes fixed upon the ground for some time, during which we\nstood still waiting anxiously to see what would come of this\nabstraction; and with no little pity, for from his behaviour, now\nstaring at the ground with fixed gaze and eyes wide open without moving\nan eyelid, again closing them, compressing his lips and raising his\neyebrows, we could perceive plainly that a fit of madness of some kind\nhad come upon him; and before long he showed that what we imagined was\nthe truth, for he arose in a fury from the ground where he had thrown\nhimself, and attacked the first he found near him with such rage and\nfierceness that if we had not dragged him off him, he would have beaten\nor bitten him to death, all the while exclaiming, 'Oh faithless\nFernando, here, here shalt thou pay the penalty of the wrong thou hast\ndone me; these hands shall tear out that heart of thine, abode and\ndwelling of all iniquity, but of deceit and fraud above all; and to\nthese he added other words all in effect upbraiding this Fernando and\ncharging him with treachery and faithlessness.\n\"We forced him to release his hold with no little difficulty, and\nwithout another word he left us, and rushing off plunged in among these\nbrakes and brambles, so as to make it impossible for us to follow him;\nfrom this we suppose that madness comes upon him from time to time, and\nthat someone called Fernando must have done him a wrong of a grievous\nnature such as the condition to which it had brought him seemed to\nshow. All this has been since then confirmed on those occasions, and\nthey have been many, on which he has crossed our path, at one time to\nbeg the shepherds to give him some of the food they carry, at another\nto take it from them by force; for when there is a fit of madness upon\nhim, even though the shepherds offer it freely, he will not accept it\nbut snatches it from them by dint of blows; but when he is in his\nsenses he begs it for the love of God, courteously and civilly, and\nreceives it with many thanks and not a few tears. And to tell you the\ntruth, sirs,\" continued the goatherd, \"it was yesterday that we\nresolved, I and four of the lads, two of them our servants, and the\nother two friends of mine, to go in search of him until we find him,\nand when we do to take him, whether by force or of his own consent, to\nthe town of Almod\u00f3var, which is eight leagues from this, and there\nstrive to cure him (if indeed his malady admits of a cure), or learn\nwhen he is in his senses who he is, and if he has relatives to whom we\nmay give notice of his misfortune. This, sirs, is all I can say in\nanswer to what you have asked me; and be sure that the owner of the\narticles you found is he whom you saw pass by with such nimbleness and\nso naked.\"",

And if your misfortune should prove to be one of\nthose that refuse admission to any sort of consolation, it was my\npurpose to join you in lamenting and mourning over it, so far as I\ncould; for it is still some comfort in misfortune to find one who can\nfeel for it. And if my good intentions deserve to be acknowledged with\nany kind of courtesy, I entreat you, se\u00f1or, by that which I perceive\nyou possess in so high a degree, and likewise conjure you by whatever\nyou love or have loved best in life, to tell me who you are and the\ncause that has brought you to live or die in these solitudes like a\nbrute beast, dwelling among them in a manner so foreign to your\ncondition as your garb and appearance show. And I swear,\" added Don\nQuixote, \"by the order of knighthood which I have received, and by my\nvocation of knight-errant, if you gratify me in this, to serve you with\nall the zeal my calling demands of me, either in relieving your\nmisfortune if it admits of relief, or in joining you in lamenting it as\nI promised to do.\"\nThe Knight of the Thicket, hearing him of the Rueful Countenance talk\nin this strain, did nothing but stare at him, and stare at him again,\nand again survey him from head to foot; and when he had thoroughly\nexamined him, he said to him:\n\"If you have anything to give me to eat, for God's sake give it me, and\nafter I have eaten I will do all you ask in acknowledgment of the\ngoodwill you have displayed towards me.\"",

In that same country\nthere was a heaven in which love had placed all the glory I could\ndesire; such was the beauty of Luscinda, a damsel as noble and as rich\nas I, but of happier fortunes, and of less firmness than was due to so\nworthy a passion as mine. This Luscinda I loved, worshipped, and adored\nfrom my earliest and tenderest years, and she loved me in all the\ninnocence and sincerity of childhood. Our parents were aware of our\nfeelings, and were not sorry to perceive them, for they saw clearly\nthat as they ripened they must lead at last to a marriage between us, a\nthing that seemed almost prearranged by the equality of our families\nand wealth. We grew up, and with our growth grew the love between us,\nso that the father of Luscinda felt bound for propriety's sake to\nrefuse me admission to his house, in this perhaps imitating the parents\nof that Thisbe so celebrated by the poets, and this refusal but added\nlove to love and flame to flame; for though they enforced silence upon\nour tongues they could not impose it upon our pens, which can make\nknown the heart's secrets to a loved one more freely than tongues; for\nmany a time the presence of the object of love shakes the firmest will\nand strikes dumb the boldest tongue. Ah heavens! how many letters did I\nwrite her, and how many dainty modest replies did I receive! how many\nditties and love-songs did I compose in which my heart declared and\nmade known its feelings, described its ardent longings, revelled in its\nrecollections and dallied with its desires! At length growing impatient\nand feeling my heart languishing with longing to see her, I resolved to\nput into execution and carry out what seemed to me the best mode of\nwinning my desired and merited reward, to ask her of her father for my\nlawful wife, which I did. To this his answer was that he thanked me for\nthe disposition I showed to do honour to him and to regard myself as\nhonoured by the bestowal of his treasure; but that as my father was\nalive it was his by right to make this demand, for if it were not in\naccordance with his full will and pleasure, Luscinda was not to be\ntaken or given by stealth. I thanked him for his kindness, reflecting\nthat there was reason in what he said, and that my father would assent",

Bound to him as I was by friendship, I strove by the\nbest arguments and the most forcible examples I could think of to\nrestrain and dissuade him from such a course; but perceiving I produced\nno effect I resolved to make the Duke Ricardo, his father, acquainted\nwith the matter; but Don Fernando, being sharp-witted and shrewd,\nforesaw and apprehended this, perceiving that by my duty as a good\nservant I was bound not to keep concealed a thing so much opposed to\nthe honour of my lord the duke; and so, to mislead and deceive me, he\ntold me he could find no better way of effacing from his mind the\nbeauty that so enslaved him than by absenting himself for some months,\nand that he wished the absence to be effected by our going, both of us,\nto my father's house under the pretence, which he would make to the\nduke, of going to see and buy some fine horses that there were in my\ncity, which produces the best in the world.

As\nshe appeared to him in her dressing-gown, she drove all the beauties he\nhad seen until then out of his recollection; speech failed him, his\nhead turned, he was spell-bound, and in the end love-smitten, as you\nwill see in the course of the story of my misfortune; and to inflame\nstill further his passion, which he hid from me and revealed to Heaven\nalone, it so happened that one day he found a note of hers entreating\nme to demand her of her father in marriage, so delicate, so modest, and\nso tender, that on reading it he told me that in Luscinda alone were\ncombined all the charms of beauty and understanding that were\ndistributed among all the other women in the world. It is true, and I\nown it now, that though I knew what good cause Don Fernando had to\npraise Luscinda, it gave me uneasiness to hear these praises from his\nmouth, and I began to fear, and with reason to feel distrust of him,\nfor there was no moment when he was not ready to talk of Luscinda, and\nhe would start the subject himself even though he dragged it in\nunseasonably, a circumstance that aroused in me a certain amount of\njealousy; not that I feared any change in the constancy or faith of\nLuscinda; but still my fate led me to forebode what she assured me\nagainst.

The truth\nof the story is that that Master Elisabad whom the madman mentioned was\na man of great prudence and sound judgment, and served as governor and\nphysician to the queen, but to suppose that she was his mistress is\nnonsense deserving very severe punishment; and as a proof that Cardenio\ndid not know what he was saying, remember when he said it he was out of\nhis wits.\"\n\"That is what I say,\" said Sancho; \"there was no occasion for minding\nthe words of a madman; for if good luck had not helped your worship,\nand he had sent that stone at your head instead of at your breast, a\nfine way we should have been in for standing up for my lady yonder, God\nconfound her! And then, would not Cardenio have gone free as a madman?\"\n\"Against men in their senses or against madmen,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"every knight-errant is bound to stand up for the honour of women,\nwhoever they may be, much more for queens of such high degree and\ndignity as Queen Madasima, for whom I have a particular regard on\naccount of her amiable qualities; for, besides being extremely\nbeautiful, she was very wise, and very patient under her misfortunes,\nof which she had many; and the counsel and society of the Master\nElisabad were a great help and support to her in enduring her\nafflictions with wisdom and resignation; hence the ignorant and\nill-disposed vulgar took occasion to say and think that she was his\nmistress; and they lie, I say it once more, and will lie two hundred\ntimes more, all who think and say so.\"\n\"I neither say nor think so,\" said Sancho; \"let them look to it; with\ntheir bread let them eat it; they have rendered account to God whether\nthey misbehaved or not; I come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am\nnot fond of prying into other men's lives; he who buys and lies feels\nit in his purse; moreover, naked was I born, naked I find myself, I\nneither lose nor gain; but if they did, what is that to me? many think\nthere are flitches where there are no hooks; but who can put gates to\nthe open plain? moreover they said of God\u2014\"\n\"God bless me,\" said Don Quixote, \"what a set of absurdities thou art\nstringing together!

            "text": "breaking them altogether for us?\"\nc25b.jpg (330K)\nFull Size\n\"Peace, I say again, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"for let me tell thee\nit is not so much the desire of finding that madman that leads me into\nthese regions as that which I have of performing among them an\nachievement wherewith I shall win eternal name and fame throughout the\nknown world; and it shall be such that I shall thereby set the seal on\nall that can make a knight-errant perfect and famous.\"\n\"And is it very perilous, this achievement?\"\n\"No,\" replied he of the Rueful Countenance; \"though it may be in the\ndice that we may throw deuce-ace instead of sixes; but all will depend\non thy diligence.\"\n\"On my diligence!\" said Sancho.\n\"Yes,\" said Don Quixote, \"for if thou dost return soon from the place\nwhere I mean to send thee, my penance will be soon over, and my glory\nwill soon begin. But as it is not right to keep thee any longer in\nsuspense, waiting to see what comes of my words, I would have thee\nknow, Sancho, that the famous Amadis of Gaul was one of the most\nperfect knights-errant\u2014I am wrong to say he was one; he stood alone,\nthe first, the only one, the lord of all that were in the world in his\ntime. A fig for Don Belianis, and for all who say he equalled him in\nany respect, for, my oath upon it, they are deceiving themselves! I\nsay, too, that when a painter desires to become famous in his art he\nendeavours to copy the originals of the rarest painters that he knows;\nand the same rule holds good for all the most important crafts and\ncallings that serve to adorn a state; thus must he who would be\nesteemed prudent and patient imitate Ulysses, in whose person and\nlabours Homer presents to us a lively picture of prudence and patience;\nas Virgil, too, shows us in the person of \u00c6neas the virtue of a pious\nson and the sagacity of a brave and skilful captain; not representing\nor describing them as they were, but as they ought to be, so as to\nleave the example of their virtues to posterity. In the same way Amadis\nwas the polestar, day-star, sun of valiant and devoted knights, whom\nall we who fight under the banner of love and chivalry are bound to\nimitate. This, then, being so, I consider, friend Sancho, that the\nknight-errant who shall imitate him most closely will come nearest to\nreaching the perfection of chivalry. Now one of the instances in which\nthis knight most conspicuously showed his prudence, worth, valour,\nendurance, fortitude, and love, was when he withdrew, rejected by the\nLady Oriana, to do penance upon the Pe\u00f1a Pobre, changing his name into\nthat of Beltenebros, a name assuredly significant and appropriate to\nthe life which he had voluntarily adopted. So, as it is easier for me\nto imitate him in this than in cleaving giants asunder, cutting off\nserpents' heads, slaying dragons, routing armies, destroying fleets,\nand breaking enchantments, and as this place is so well suited for a\nsimilar purpose, I must not allow the opportunity to escape which now\nso conveniently offers me its forelock.\"\n\"What is it in reality,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship means to do in\nsuch an out-of-the-way place as this?\"\n\"Have I not told thee,\" answered Don Quixote, \"that I mean to imitate\nAmadis here, playing the victim of despair, the madman, the maniac, so\nas at the same time to imitate the valiant Don Roland, when at the\nfountain he had evidence of the fair Angelica having disgraced herself\nwith Medoro and through grief thereat went mad, and plucked up trees,\ntroubled the waters of the clear springs, slew shepherds, destroyed\nflocks, burned down huts, levelled houses, dragged mares after him, and\nperpetrated a hundred thousand other outrages worthy of everlasting\nrenown and record? And though I have no intention of imitating Roland,\nor Orlando, or Rotolando (for he went by all these names), step by step\nin all the mad things he did, said, and thought, I will make a rough\ncopy to the best of my power of all that seems to me most essential;\nbut perhaps I shall content myself with the simple imitation of Amadis,\nwho without giving way to any mischievous madness but merely to tears",

            "text": "and sorrow, gained as much fame as the most famous.\"\n\"It seems to me,\" said Sancho, \"that the knights who behaved in this\nway had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what\ncause has your worship for going mad? What lady has rejected you, or\nwhat evidence have you found to prove that the lady Dulcinea del Toboso\nhas been trifling with Moor or Christian?\"\n\"There is the point,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and that is the beauty of\nthis business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when\nhe has cause; the thing is to turn crazy without any provocation, and\nlet my lady know, if I do this in the dry, what I would do in the\nmoist; moreover I have abundant cause in the long separation I have\nendured from my lady till death, Dulcinea del Toboso; for as thou didst\nhear that shepherd Ambrosio say the other day, in absence all ills are\nfelt and feared; and so, friend Sancho, waste no time in advising me\nagainst so rare, so happy, and so unheard-of an imitation; mad I am,\nand mad I must be until thou returnest with the answer to a letter that\nI mean to send by thee to my lady Dulcinea; and if it be such as my\nconstancy deserves, my insanity and penance will come to an end; and if\nit be to the opposite effect, I shall become mad in earnest, and, being\nso, I shall suffer no more; thus in whatever way she may answer I shall\nescape from the struggle and affliction in which thou wilt leave me,\nenjoying in my senses the boon thou bearest me, or as a madman not\nfeeling the evil thou bringest me. But tell me, Sancho, hast thou got\nMambrino's helmet safe? for I saw thee take it up from the ground when\nthat ungrateful wretch tried to break it in pieces but could not, by\nwhich the fineness of its temper may be seen.\"\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"By the living God, Sir Knight of the\nRueful Countenance, I cannot endure or bear with patience some of the\nthings that your worship says; and from them I begin to suspect that\nall you tell me about chivalry, and winning kingdoms and empires, and\ngiving islands, and bestowing other rewards and dignities after the\ncustom of knights-errant, must be all made up of wind and lies, and all\npigments or figments, or whatever we may call them; for what would\nanyone think that heard your worship calling a barber's basin\nMambrino's helmet without ever seeing the mistake all this time, but\nthat one who says and maintains such things must have his brains\naddled? I have the basin in my sack all dinted, and I am taking it home\nto have it mended, to trim my beard in it, if, by God's grace, I am\nallowed to see my wife and children some day or other.\"\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"by him thou didst swear by just\nnow I swear thou hast the most limited understanding that any squire in\nthe world has or ever had. Is it possible that all this time thou hast\nbeen going about with me thou hast never found out that all things\nbelonging to knights-errant seem to be illusions and nonsense and\nravings, and to go always by contraries? And not because it really is\nso, but because there is always a swarm of enchanters in attendance\nupon us that change and alter everything with us, and turn things as\nthey please, and according as they are disposed to aid or destroy us;\nthus what seems to thee a barber's basin seems to me Mambrino's helmet,\nand to another it will seem something else; and rare foresight it was\nin the sage who is on my side to make what is really and truly\nMambrino's helmet seem a basin to everybody, for, being held in such\nestimation as it is, all the world would pursue me to rob me of it; but\nwhen they see it is only a barber's basin they do not take the trouble\nto obtain it; as was plainly shown by him who tried to break it, and\nleft it on the ground without taking it, for, by my faith, had he known\nit he would never have left it behind. Keep it safe, my friend, for\njust now I have no need of it; indeed, I shall have to take off all\nthis armour and remain as naked as I was born, if I have a mind to\nfollow Roland rather than Amadis in my penance.\"\nThus talking they reached the foot of a high mountain which stood like\nan isolated peak among the others that surrounded it. Past its base\nthere flowed a gentle brook, all around it spread a meadow so green and\nluxuriant that it was a delight to the eyes to look upon it, and forest\ntrees in abundance, and shrubs and flowers, added to the charms of the\nspot. Upon this place the Knight of the Rueful Countenance fixed his\nchoice for the performance of his penance, and as he beheld it\nexclaimed in a loud voice as though he were out of his senses:\n\"This is the place, oh, ye heavens, that I select and choose for\nbewailing the misfortune in which ye yourselves have plunged me: this\nis the spot where the overflowings of mine eyes shall swell the waters\nof yon little brook, and my deep and endless sighs shall stir\nunceasingly the leaves of these mountain trees, in testimony and token\nof the pain my persecuted heart is suffering. Oh, ye rural deities,\nwhoever ye be that haunt this lone spot, give ear to the complaint of a\nwretched lover whom long absence and brooding jealousy have driven to\nbewail his fate among these wilds and complain of the hard heart of\nthat fair and ungrateful one, the end and limit of all human beauty!\nOh, ye wood nymphs and dryads, that dwell in the thickets of the\nforest, so may the nimble wanton satyrs by whom ye are vainly wooed\nnever disturb your sweet repose, help me to lament my hard fate or at\nleast weary not at listening to it! Oh, Dulcinea del Toboso, day of my\nnight, glory of my pain, guide of my path, star of my fortune, so may\nHeaven grant thee in full all thou seekest of it, bethink thee of the\nplace and condition to which absence from thee has brought me, and make\nthat return in kindness that is due to my fidelity! Oh, lonely trees,\nthat from this day forward shall bear me company in my solitude, give\nme some sign by the gentle movement of your boughs that my presence is\nnot distasteful to you! Oh, thou, my squire, pleasant companion in my\nprosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy memory what thou shalt\nsee me do here, so that thou mayest relate and report it to the sole\ncause of all,\" and so saying he dismounted from Rocinante, and in an\ninstant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and giving him a slap on the\ncroup, said, \"He gives thee freedom who is bereft of it himself, oh\nsteed as excellent in deed as thou art unfortunate in thy lot; begone\nwhere thou wilt, for thou bearest written on thy forehead that neither\nAstolfo's hippogriff, nor the famed Frontino that cost Bradamante so\ndear, could equal thee in speed.\"\nSeeing this Sancho said, \"Good luck to him who has saved us the trouble\nof stripping the pack-saddle off Dapple! By my faith he would not have\ngone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise;\nthough if he were here I would not let anyone strip him, for there\nwould be no occasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim of\ndespair about him, inasmuch as his master, which I was while it was\nGod's pleasure, was nothing of the sort; and indeed, Sir Knight of the\nRueful Countenance, if my departure and your worship's madness are to\ncome off in earnest, it will be as well to saddle Rocinante again in\norder that he may supply the want of Dapple, because it will save me\ntime in going and returning: for if I go on foot I don't know when I\nshall get there or when I shall get back, as I am, in truth, a bad\nwalker.\"\n\"I declare, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote, \"it shall be as thou wilt,\nfor thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thou\nwilt depart, for I wish thee to observe in the meantime what I do and\nsay for her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it.\"\n\"But what more have I to see besides what I have seen?\" said Sancho.\n\"Much thou knowest about it!\" said Don Quixote. \"I have now got to tear\nup my garments, to scatter about my armour, knock my head against these\nrocks, and more of the same sort of thing, which thou must witness.\"\n\"For the love of God,\" said Sancho, \"be careful, your worship, how you\ngive yourself those knocks on the head, for you may come across such a\nrock, and in such a way, that the very first may put an end to the\nwhole contrivance of this penance; and I should think, if indeed knocks\non the head seem necessary to you, and this business cannot be done\nwithout them, you might be content\u2014as the whole thing is feigned, and\ncounterfeit, and in joke\u2014you might be content, I say, with giving them\nto yourself in the water, or against something soft, like cotton; and\nleave it all to me; for I'll tell my lady that your worship knocked\nyour head against a point of rock harder than a diamond.\"\n\"I thank thee for thy good intentions, friend Sancho,\" answered Don\nQuixote, \"but I would have thee know that all these things I am doing\nare not in joke, but very much in earnest, for anything else would be a\ntransgression of the ordinances of chivalry, which forbid us to tell\nany lie whatever under the penalties due to apostasy; and to do one\nthing instead of another is just the same as lying; so my knocks on the\nhead must be real, solid, and valid, without anything sophisticated or\nfanciful about them, and it will be needful to leave me some lint to\ndress my wounds, since fortune has compelled us to do without the\nbalsam we lost.\"\n\"It was worse losing the ass,\" replied Sancho, \"for with him lint and\nall were lost; but I beg of your worship not to remind me again of that\naccursed liquor, for my soul, not to say my stomach, turns at hearing\nthe very name of it; and I beg of you, too, to reckon as past the three\ndays you allowed me for seeing the mad things you do, for I take them\nas seen already and pronounced upon, and I will tell wonderful stories\nto my lady; so write the letter and send me off at once, for I long to\nreturn and take your worship out of this purgatory where I am leaving",

But it has just occurred to me how it may be\nconveniently and even more than conveniently written, and that is in\nthe notebook that belonged to Cardenio, and thou wilt take care to have\nit copied on paper, in a good hand, at the first village thou comest to\nwhere there is a schoolmaster, or if not, any sacristan will copy it;\nbut see thou give it not to any notary to copy, for they write a law\nhand that Satan could not make out.\"\n\"But what is to be done about the signature?\" said Sancho.\n\"The letters of Amadis were never signed,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"That is all very well,\" said Sancho, \"but the order must needs be\nsigned, and if it is copied they will say the signature is false, and I\nshall be left without ass-colts.\"\n\"The order shall go signed in the same book,\" said Don Quixote, \"and on\nseeing it my niece will make no difficulty about obeying it; as to the\nloveletter thou canst put by way of signature, '_Yours till death, the\nKnight of the Rueful Countenance._' And it will be no great matter if\nit is in some other person's hand, for as well as I recollect Dulcinea\ncan neither read nor write, nor in the whole course of her life has she\nseen handwriting or letter of mine, for my love and hers have been\nalways platonic, not going beyond a modest look, and even that so\nseldom that I can safely swear I have not seen her four times in all\nthese twelve years I have been loving her more than the light of these\neyes that the earth will one day devour; and perhaps even of those four\ntimes she has not once perceived that I was looking at her: such is the\nretirement and seclusion in which her father Lorenzo Corchuelo and her\nmother Aldonza Nogales have brought her up.\"\n\"So, so!\" said Sancho; \"Lorenzo Corchuelo's daughter is the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso, otherwise called Aldonza Lorenzo?\"\n\"She it is,\" said Don Quixote, \"and she it is that is worthy to be lady\nof the whole universe.\"\n\"I know her well,\" said Sancho, \"and let me tell you she can fling a\ncrowbar as well as the lustiest lad in all the town. Giver of all good!\nbut she is a brave lass, and a right and stout one, and fit to be\nhelpmate to any knight-errant that is or is to be, who may make her his\nlady: the whoreson wench, what sting she has and what a voice! I can\ntell you one day she posted herself on the top of the belfry of the\nvillage to call some labourers of theirs that were in a ploughed field\nof her father's, and though they were better than half a league off\nthey heard her as well as if they were at the foot of the tower; and\nthe best of her is that she is not a bit prudish, for she has plenty of\naffability, and jokes with everybody, and has a grin and a jest for\neverything. So, Sir Knight of the Rueful Countenance, I say you not\nonly may and ought to do mad freaks for her sake, but you have a good\nright to give way to despair and hang yourself; and no one who knows of\nit but will say you did well, though the devil should take you; and I\nwish I were on my road already, simply to see her, for it is many a day\nsince I saw her, and she must be altered by this time, for going about\nthe fields always, and the sun and the air spoil women's looks greatly.\nBut I must own the truth to your worship, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote; until now\nI have been under a great mistake, for I believed truly and honestly\nthat the lady Dulcinea must be some princess your worship was in love\nwith, or some person great enough to deserve the rich presents you have\nsent her, such as the Biscayan and the galley slaves, and many more no\ndoubt, for your worship must have won many victories in the time when I\nwas not yet your squire. But all things considered, what good can it do\nthe lady Aldonza Lorenzo, I mean the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, to have\nthe vanquished your worship sends or will send coming to her and going\ndown on their knees before her? Because maybe when they came she'd be\nhackling flax or threshing on the threshing floor, and they'd be\nashamed to see her, and she'd laugh, or resent the present.\"\n\"I have before now told thee many times, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote,\n\"that thou art a mighty great chatterer, and that with a blunt wit thou\nart always striving at sharpness; but to show thee what a fool thou art\nand how rational I am, I would have thee listen to a short story. Thou\nmust know that a certain widow, fair, young, independent, and rich, and\nabove all free and easy, fell in love with a sturdy strapping young\nlay-brother; his superior came to know of it, and one day said to the\nworthy widow by way of brotherly remonstrance, 'I am surprised, se\u00f1ora,\nand not without good reason, that a woman of such high standing, so\nfair, and so rich as you are, should have fallen in love with such a\nmean, low, stupid fellow as So-and-so, when in this house there are so\nmany masters, graduates, and divinity students from among whom you\nmight choose as if they were a lot of pears, saying, 'This one I'll\ntake, that I won't take;' but she replied to him with great\nsprightliness and candour, 'My dear sir, you are very much mistaken,\nand your ideas are very old-fashioned, if you think that I have made a\nbad choice in So-and-so, fool as he seems; because for all I want with\nhim he knows as much and more philosophy than Aristotle.' In the same\nway, Sancho, for all I want with Dulcinea del Toboso she is just as\ngood as the most exalted princess on earth. It is not to be supposed\nthat all those poets who sang the praises of ladies under the fancy\nnames they give them, had any such mistresses. Thinkest thou that the\nAmarillises, the Phillises, the Sylvias, the Dianas, the Galateas, the\nF\u00edlidas, and all the rest of them, that the books, the ballads, the\nbarber's shops, the theatres are full of, were really and truly ladies\nof flesh and blood, and mistresses of those that glorify and have\nglorified them? Nothing of the kind; they only invent them for the most\npart to furnish a subject for their verses, and that they may pass for\nlovers, or for men valiant enough to be so; and so it suffices me to\nthink and believe that the good Aldonza Lorenzo is fair and virtuous;\nand as to her pedigree it is very little matter, for no one will\nexamine into it for the purpose of conferring any order upon her, and\nI, for my part, reckon her the most exalted princess in the world. For\nthou shouldst know, Sancho, if thou dost not know, that two things\nalone beyond all others are incentives to love, and these are great\nbeauty and a good name, and these two things are to be found in\nDulcinea in the highest degree, for in beauty no one equals her and in\ngood name few approach her; and to put the whole thing in a nutshell, I\npersuade myself that all I say is as I say, neither more nor less, and\nI picture her in my imagination as I would have her to be, as well in\nbeauty as in condition; Helen approaches her not nor does Lucretia come\nup to her, nor any other of the famous women of times past, Greek,\nBarbarian, or Latin; and let each say what he will, for if in this I am\ntaken to task by the ignorant, I shall not be censured by the\ncritical.\"\n\"I say that your worship is entirely right,\" said Sancho, \"and that I\nam an ass. But I know not how the name of ass came into my mouth, for a\nrope is not to be mentioned in the house of him who has been hanged;\nbut now for the letter, and then, God be with you, I am off.\"\nDon Quixote took out the notebook, and, retiring to one side, very\ndeliberately began to write the letter, and when he had finished it he\ncalled to Sancho, saying he wished to read it to him, so that he might\ncommit it to memory, in case of losing it on the road; for with evil\nfortune like his anything might be apprehended. To which Sancho\nreplied, \"Write it two or three times there in the book and give it to\nme, and I will carry it very carefully, because to expect me to keep it\nin my memory is all nonsense, for I have such a bad one that I often\nforget my own name; but for all that repeat it to me, as I shall like\nto hear it, for surely it will run as if it was in print.\"\n\"Listen,\" said Don Quixote, \"this is what it says:\n_\"Don Quixote's Letter to Dulcinea del Toboso_\n\"Sovereign and exalted Lady,\u2014The pierced by the point of absence, the\nwounded to the heart's core, sends thee, sweetest Dulcinea del Toboso,\nthe health that he himself enjoys not. If thy beauty despises me, if\nthy worth is not for me, if thy scorn is my affliction, though I be\nsufficiently long-suffering, hardly shall I endure this anxiety, which,\nbesides being oppressive, is protracted. My good squire Sancho will\nrelate to thee in full, fair ingrate, dear enemy, the condition to\nwhich I am reduced on thy account: if it be thy pleasure to give me\nrelief, I am thine; if not, do as may be pleasing to thee; for by\nending my life I shall satisfy thy cruelty and my desire.\n\"Thine till death,\n\"The Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\"\n\"By the life of my father,\" said Sancho, when he heard the letter, \"it\nis the loftiest thing I ever heard. Body of me! how your worship says\neverything as you like in it! And how well you fit in 'The Knight of\nthe Rueful Countenance' into the signature. I declare your worship is\nindeed the very devil, and there is nothing you don't know.\"\n\"Everything is needed for the calling I follow,\" said Don Quixote.\n\"Now then,\" said Sancho, \"let your worship put the order for the three\nass-colts on the other side, and sign it very plainly, that they may\nrecognise it at first sight.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said Don Quixote, and as he had written it he read",

Done in\nthe heart of the Sierra Morena, the twenty-seventh of August of this\npresent year.\"\n\"That will do,\" said Sancho; \"now let your worship sign it.\"\n\"There is no need to sign it,\" said Don Quixote, \"but merely to put my\nflourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses,\nor even three hundred.\"\n\"I can trust your worship,\" returned Sancho; \"let me go and saddle\nRocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for I mean to go at\nonce without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; I'll say\nI saw you do so many that she will not want any more.\"\n\"At any rate, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"I should like\u2014and there is\nreason for it\u2014I should like thee, I say, to see me stripped to the skin\nand performing a dozen or two of insanities, which I can get done in\nless than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thou\ncanst then safely swear to the rest that thou wouldst add; and I\npromise thee thou wilt not tell of as many as I mean to perform.\"\n\"For the love of God, master mine,\" said Sancho, \"let me not see your\nworship stripped, for it will sorely grieve me, and I shall not be able\nto keep from tears, and my head aches so with all I shed last night for\nDapple, that I am not fit to begin any fresh weeping; but if it is your\nworship's pleasure that I should see some insanities, do them in your\nclothes, short ones, and such as come readiest to hand; for I myself\nwant nothing of the sort, and, as I have said, it will be a saving of\ntime for my return, which will be with the news your worship desires\nand deserves. If not, let the lady Dulcinea look to it; if she does not\nanswer reasonably, I swear as solemnly as I can that I will fetch a\nfair answer out of her stomach with kicks and cuffs; for why should it\nbe borne that a knight-errant as famous as your worship should go mad\nwithout rhyme or reason for a\u2014?

Will you\nsally out on the road like Cardenio to force it from the shepherds?\"\n\"Let not that anxiety trouble thee,\" replied Don Quixote, \"for even if\nI had it I should not eat anything but the herbs and the fruits which\nthis meadow and these trees may yield me; the beauty of this business\nof mine lies in not eating, and in performing other mortifications.\"\n\"Do you know what I am afraid of?\" said Sancho upon this; \"that I shall\nnot be able to find my way back to this spot where I am leaving you, it\nis such an out-of-the-way place.\"\n\"Observe the landmarks well,\" said Don Quixote, \"for I will try not to\ngo far from this neighbourhood, and I will even take care to mount the\nhighest of these rocks to see if I can discover thee returning;\nhowever, not to miss me and lose thyself, the best plan will be to cut\nsome branches of the broom that is so abundant about here, and as thou\ngoest to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain;\nthese will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth\nof Theseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy return.\"\n\"So I will,\" said Sancho Panza, and having cut some, he asked his\nmaster's blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his\nleave of him, and mounting Rocinante, of whom Don Quixote charged him\nearnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the\nplain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had\nrecommended him; and so he went his way, though Don Quixote still",

Though cunning\ndevices did not avail him against Bernardo del Carpio, who knew all\nabout them, and strangled him in his arms at Roncesvalles. But putting\nthe question of his valour aside, let us come to his losing his wits,\nfor certain it is that he did lose them in consequence of the proofs he\ndiscovered at the fountain, and the intelligence the shepherd gave him\nof Angelica having slept more than two siestas with Medoro, a little\ncurly-headed Moor, and page to Agramante. If he was persuaded that this\nwas true, and that his lady had wronged him, it is no wonder that he\nshould have gone mad; but I, how am I to imitate him in his madness,\nunless I can imitate him in the cause of it? For my Dulcinea, I will\nventure to swear, never saw a Moor in her life, as he is, in his proper\ncostume, and she is this day as the mother that bore her, and I should\nplainly be doing her a wrong if, fancying anything else, I were to go\nmad with the same kind of madness as Roland the Furious. On the other\nhand, I see that Amadis of Gaul, without losing his senses and without\ndoing anything mad, acquired as a lover as much fame as the most\nfamous; for, according to his history, on finding himself rejected by\nhis lady Oriana, who had ordered him not to appear in her presence\nuntil it should be her pleasure, all he did was to retire to the Pe\u00f1a\nPobre in company with a hermit, and there he took his fill of weeping\nuntil Heaven sent him relief in the midst of his great grief and need.\nAnd if this be true, as it is, why should I now take the trouble to\nstrip stark naked, or do mischief to these trees which have done me no\nharm, or why am I to disturb the clear waters of these brooks which\nwill give me to drink whenever I have a mind? Long live the memory of\nAmadis and let him be imitated so far as is possible by Don Quixote of\nLa Mancha, of whom it will be said, as was said of the other, that if\nhe did not achieve great things, he died in attempting them; and if I\nam not repulsed or rejected by my Dulcinea, it is enough for me, as I\nhave said, to be absent from her. And so, now to business; come to my\nmemory ye deeds of Amadis, and show me how I am to begin to imitate\nyou. I know already that what he chiefly did was to pray and commend\nhimself to God; but what am I to do for a rosary, for I have not got\none?\"\nAnd then it occurred to him how he might make one, and that was by\ntearing a great strip off the tail of his shirt which hung down, and\nmaking eleven knots on it, one bigger than the rest, and this served\nhim for a rosary all the time he was there, during which he repeated\ncountless ave-marias. But what distressed him greatly was not having\nanother hermit there to confess him and receive consolation from; and\nso he solaced himself with pacing up and down the little meadow, and\nwriting and carving on the bark of the trees and on the fine sand a\nmultitude of verses all in harmony with his sadness, and some in praise\nof Dulcinea; but, when he was found there afterwards, the only ones\ncompletely legible that could be discovered were those that follow\nhere:\nYe on the mountainside that grow,\nYe green things all, trees, shrubs, and bushes,\nAre ye aweary of the woe\nThat this poor aching bosom crushes?\nIf it disturb you, and I owe\nSome reparation, it may be a\nDefence for me to let you know\nDon Quixote's tears are on the flow,\nAnd all for distant Dulcinea\nDel Toboso.\nThe lealest lover time can show,\nDoomed for a lady-love to languish,\nAmong these solitudes doth go,\nA prey to every kind of anguish.\nWhy Love should like a spiteful foe\nThus use him, he hath no idea,\nBut hogsheads full\u2014this doth he know\u2014\nDon Quixote's tears are on the flow,\nAnd all for distant Dulcinea\nDel Toboso.\nAdventure-seeking doth he go\nUp rugged heights, down rocky valleys,\nBut hill or dale, or high or low,\nMishap attendeth all his sallies:\nLove still pursues him to and fro,\nAnd plies his cruel scourge\u2014ah me! a\nRelentless fate, an endless woe;\nDon Quixote's tears are on the flow,\nAnd all for distant Dulcinea\nDel Toboso.\nThe addition of \"Del Toboso\" to Dulcinea's name gave rise to no little\nlaughter among those who found the above lines, for they suspected Don\nQuixote must have fancied that unless he added \"del Toboso\" when he\nintroduced the name of Dulcinea the verse would be unintelligible;\nwhich was indeed the fact, as he himself afterwards admitted. He wrote\nmany more, but, as has been said, these three verses were all that\ncould be plainly and perfectly deciphered. In this way, and in sighing\nand calling on the fauns and satyrs of the woods and the nymphs of the\nstreams, and Echo, moist and mournful, to answer, console, and hear\nhim, as well as in looking for herbs to sustain him, he passed his time\nuntil Sancho's return; and had that been delayed three weeks, as it was\nthree days, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance would have worn such\nan altered countenance that the mother that bore him would not have\nknown him: and here it will be well to leave him, wrapped up in sighs\nand verses, to relate how Sancho Panza fared on his mission.\nAs for him, coming out upon the high road, he made for El Toboso, and\nthe next day reached the inn where the mishap of the blanket had\nbefallen him. As soon as he recognised it he felt as if he were once\nmore living through the air, and he could not bring himself to enter it\nthough it was an hour when he might well have done so, for it was\ndinner-time, and he longed to taste something hot as it had been all\ncold fare with him for many days past. This craving drove him to draw\nnear to the inn, still undecided whether to go in or not, and as he was\nhesitating there came out two persons who at once recognised him, and\nsaid one to the other:\n\"Se\u00f1or licentiate, is not he on the horse there Sancho Panza who, our\nadventurer's housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?\"\n\"So it is,\" said the licentiate, \"and that is our friend Don Quixote's\nhorse;\" and if they knew him so well it was because they were the\ncurate and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out\nthe scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they\nrecognised Sancho Panza and Rocinante, being anxious to hear of Don\nQuixote, they approached, and calling him by his name the curate said,\n\"Friend Sancho Panza, where is your master?\"\nSancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place\nand circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he\nreplied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain\nmatter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the\neyes in his head.\n\"Nay, nay,\" said the barber, \"if you don't tell us where he is, Sancho\nPanza, we will suspect as we suspect already, that you have murdered\nand robbed him, for here you are mounted on his horse; in fact, you\nmust produce the master of the hack, or else take the consequences.\"\n\"There is no need of threats with me,\" said Sancho, \"for I am not a man\nto rob or murder anybody; let his own fate, or God who made him, kill\neach one; my master is engaged very much to his taste doing penance in\nthe midst of these mountains;\" and then, offhand and without stopping,\nhe told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and\nhow he was carrying a letter to the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, the\ndaughter of Lorenzo Corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in\nlove. They were both amazed at what Sancho Panza told them; for though\nthey were aware of Don Quixote's madness and the nature of it, each\ntime they heard of it they were filled with fresh wonder. They then\nasked Sancho Panza to show them the letter he was carrying to the lady\nDulcinea del Toboso. He said it was written in a notebook, and that his\nmaster's directions were that he should have it copied on paper at the\nfirst village he came to. On this the curate said if he showed it to\nhim, he himself would make a fair copy of it. Sancho put his hand into\nhis bosom in search of the notebook but could not find it, nor, if he\nhad been searching until now, could he have found it, for Don Quixote\nhad kept it, and had never given it to him, nor had he himself thought\nof asking for it. When Sancho discovered he could not find the book his\nface grew deadly pale, and in great haste he again felt his body all\nover, and seeing plainly it was not to be found, without more ado he\nseized his beard with both hands and plucked away half of it, and then,\nas quick as he could and without stopping, gave himself half a dozen\ncuffs on the face and nose till they were bathed in blood.\nSeeing this, the curate and the barber asked him what had happened him\nthat he gave himself such rough treatment.\n\"What should happen to me?\" replied Sancho, \"but to have lost from one\nhand to the other, in a moment, three ass-colts, each of them like a\ncastle?\"\n\"How is that?\" said the barber.\n\"I have lost the notebook,\" said Sancho, \"that contained the letter to\nDulcinea, and an order signed by my master in which he directed his\nniece to give me three ass-colts out of four or five he had at home;\"\nand he then told them about the loss of Dapple.\nThe curate consoled him, telling him that when his master was found he\nwould get him to renew the order, and make a fresh draft on paper, as\nwas usual and customary; for those made in notebooks were never\naccepted or honoured.\nSancho comforted himself with this, and said if that were so the loss\nof Dulcinea's letter did not trouble him much, for he had it almost by\nheart, and it could be taken down from him wherever and whenever they\nliked.\n\"Repeat it then, Sancho,\" said the barber, \"and we will write it down\nafterwards.\"\nSancho Panza stopped to scratch his head to bring back the letter to\nhis memory, and balanced himself now on one foot, now the other, one\nmoment staring at the ground, the next at the sky, and after having\nhalf gnawed off the end of a finger and kept them in suspense waiting\nfor him to begin, he said, after a long pause, \"By God, se\u00f1or\nlicentiate, devil a thing can I recollect of the letter; but it said at\nthe beginning, 'Exalted and scrubbing Lady.'\"\n\"It cannot have said 'scrubbing,'\" said the barber, \"but 'superhuman'\nor 'sovereign.'\"\n\"That is it,\" said Sancho; \"then, as well as I remember, it went on,\n'The wounded, and wanting of sleep, and the pierced, kisses your\nworship's hands, ungrateful and very unrecognised fair one; and it said\nsomething or other about health and sickness that he was sending her;\nand from that it went tailing off until it ended with 'Yours till\ndeath, the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.'\"\nIt gave them no little amusement, both of them, to see what a good\nmemory Sancho had, and they complimented him greatly upon it, and\nbegged him to repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they\ntoo might get it by heart to write it out by-and-by. Sancho repeated it\nthree times, and as he did, uttered three thousand more absurdities;\nthen he told them more about his master but he never said a word about\nthe blanketing that had befallen himself in that inn, into which he\nrefused to enter. He told them, moreover, how his lord, if he brought\nhim a favourable answer from the lady Dulcinea del Toboso, was to put\nhimself in the way of endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a\nmonarch; for it had been so settled between them, and with his personal\nworth and the might of his arm it was an easy matter to come to be one:\nand how on becoming one his lord was to make a marriage for him (for he\nwould be a widower by that time, as a matter of course) and was to give\nhim as a wife one of the damsels of the empress, the heiress of some\nrich and grand state on the mainland, having nothing to do with islands\nof any sort, for he did not care for them now. All this Sancho\ndelivered with so much composure\u2014wiping his nose from time to time\u2014and\nwith so little common-sense that his two hearers were again filled with\nwonder at the force of Don Quixote's madness that could run away with\nthis poor man's reason. They did not care to take the trouble of\ndisabusing him of his error, as they considered that since it did not\nin any way hurt his conscience it would be better to leave him in it,\nand they would have all the more amusement in listening to his\nsimplicities; and so they bade him pray to God for his lord's health,\nas it was a very likely and a very feasible thing for him in course of\ntime to come to be an emperor, as he said, or at least an archbishop or\nsome other dignitary of equal rank.\nTo which Sancho made answer, \"If fortune, sirs, should bring things\nabout in such a way that my master should have a mind, instead of being\nan emperor, to be an archbishop, I should like to know what\narchbishops-errant commonly give their squires?\"\n\"They commonly give them,\" said the curate, some simple benefice or\ncure, or some place as sacristan which brings them a good fixed income,\nnot counting the altar fees, which may be reckoned at as much more.\"\n\"But for that,\" said Sancho, \"the squire must be unmarried, and must\nknow, at any rate, how to help at mass, and if that be so, woe is me,\nfor I am married already and I don't know the first letter of the A B\nC. What will become of me if my master takes a fancy to be an\narchbishop and not an emperor, as is usual and customary with\nknights-errant?\"\n\"Be not uneasy, friend Sancho,\" said the barber, \"for we will entreat\nyour master, and advise him, even urging it upon him as a case of",

By-and-by, after they had between\nthem carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their\nobject, the curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour Don\nQuixote, and effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained\nto the barber, was that he himself should assume the disguise of a\nwandering damsel, while the other should try as best he could to pass\nfor a squire, and that they should thus proceed to where Don Quixote\nwas, and he, pretending to be an aggrieved and distressed damsel,\nshould ask a favour of him, which as a valiant knight-errant he could\nnot refuse to grant; and the favour he meant to ask him was that he\nshould accompany her whither she would conduct him, in order to redress\na wrong which a wicked knight had done her, while at the same time she\nshould entreat him not to require her to remove her mask, nor ask her\nany question touching her circumstances until he had righted her with\nthe wicked knight. And he had no doubt that Don Quixote would comply\nwith any request made in these terms, and that in this way they might\nremove him and take him to his own village, where they would endeavour\nto find out if his extraordinary madness admitted of any kind of\nremedy.",

They begged a petticoat and hood of the landlady, leaving\nher in pledge a new cassock of the curate's; and the barber made a\nbeard out of a grey-brown or red ox-tail in which the landlord used to\nstick his comb. The landlady asked them what they wanted these things\nfor, and the curate told her in a few words about the madness of Don\nQuixote, and how this disguise was intended to get him away from the\nmountain where he then was. The landlord and landlady immediately came\nto the conclusion that the madman was their guest, the balsam man and\nmaster of the blanketed squire, and they told the curate all that had\npassed between him and them, not omitting what Sancho had been so\nsilent about. Finally the landlady dressed up the curate in a style\nthat left nothing to be desired; she put on him a cloth petticoat with\nblack velvet stripes a palm broad, all slashed, and a bodice of green\nvelvet set off by a binding of white satin, which as well as the\npetticoat must have been made in the time of king Wamba. The curate\nwould not let them hood him, but put on his head a little quilted linen\ncap which he used for a night-cap, and bound his forehead with a strip\nof black silk, while with another he made a mask with which he\nconcealed his beard and face very well. He then put on his hat, which\nwas broad enough to serve him for an umbrella, and enveloping himself\nin his cloak seated himself woman-fashion on his mule, while the barber\nmounted his with a beard down to the waist of mingled red and white,\nfor it was, as has been said, the tail of a clay-red ox.\nThey took leave of all, and of the good Maritornes, who, sinner as she\nwas, promised to pray a rosary of prayers that God might grant them\nsuccess in such an arduous and Christian undertaking as that they had\nin hand. But hardly had he sallied forth from the inn when it struck\nthe curate that he was doing wrong in rigging himself out in that\nfashion, as it was an indecorous thing for a priest to dress himself\nthat way even though much might depend upon it; and saying so to the\nbarber he begged him to change dresses, as it was fitter he should be\nthe distressed damsel, while he himself would play the squire's part,\nwhich would be less derogatory to his dignity; otherwise he was\nresolved to have nothing more to do with the matter, and let the devil\ntake Don Quixote. Just at this moment Sancho came up, and on seeing the\npair in such a costume he was unable to restrain his laughter; the\nbarber, however, agreed to do as the curate wished, and, altering their\nplan, the curate went on to instruct him how to play his part and what\nto say to Don Quixote to induce and compel him to come with them and\ngive up his fancy for the place he had chosen for his idle penance. The\nbarber told him he could manage it properly without any instruction,\nand as he did not care to dress himself up until they were near where\nDon Quixote was, he folded up the garments, and the curate adjusted his\nbeard, and they set out under the guidance of Sancho Panza, who went",

He, showing no astonishment when he saw them, stood still\nwith his head bent down upon his breast like one in deep thought,\nwithout raising his eyes to look at them after the first glance when\nthey suddenly came upon him. The curate, who was aware of his\nmisfortune and recognised him by the description, being a man of good\naddress, approached him and in a few sensible words entreated and urged\nhim to quit a life of such misery, lest he should end it there, which\nwould be the greatest of all misfortunes. Cardenio was then in his\nright mind, free from any attack of that madness which so frequently\ncarried him away, and seeing them dressed in a fashion so unusual among\nthe frequenters of those wilds, could not help showing some surprise,\nespecially when he heard them speak of his case as if it were a\nwell-known matter (for the curate's words gave him to understand as\nmuch) so he replied to them thus:\n\"I see plainly, sirs, whoever you may be, that Heaven, whose care it is\nto succour the good, and even the wicked very often, here, in this\nremote spot, cut off from human intercourse, sends me, though I deserve\nit not, those who seek to draw me away from this to some better\nretreat, showing me by many and forcible arguments how unreasonably I\nact in leading the life I do; but as they know, that if I escape from\nthis evil I shall fall into another still greater, perhaps they will\nset me down as a weak-minded man, or, what is worse, one devoid of\nreason; nor would it be any wonder, for I myself can perceive that the\neffect of the recollection of my misfortunes is so great and works so\npowerfully to my ruin, that in spite of myself I become at times like a\nstone, without feeling or consciousness; and I come to feel the truth\nof it when they tell me and show me proofs of the things I have done\nwhen the terrible fit overmasters me; and all I can do is bewail my lot\nin vain, and idly curse my destiny, and plead for my madness by telling\nhow it was caused, to any that care to hear it; for no reasonable\nbeings on learning the cause will wonder at the effects; and if they\ncannot help me at least they will not blame me, and the repugnance they\nfeel at my wild ways will turn into pity for my woes. If it be, sirs,\nthat you are here with the same design as others have come with, before\nyou proceed with your wise arguments, I entreat you to hear the story\nof my countless misfortunes, for perhaps when you have heard it you\nwill spare yourselves the trouble you would take in offering\nconsolation to grief that is beyond the reach of it.\"\nAs they, both of them, desired nothing more than to hear from his own\nlips the cause of his suffering, they entreated him to tell it,\npromising not to do anything for his relief or comfort that he did not\nwish; and thereupon the unhappy gentleman began his sad story in nearly\nthe same words and manner in which he had related it to Don Quixote and\nthe goatherd a few days before, when, through Master Elisabad, and Don\nQuixote's scrupulous observance of what was due to chivalry, the tale\nwas left unfinished, as this history has already recorded; but now\nfortunately the mad fit kept off, allowed him to tell it to the end;\nand so, coming to the incident of the note which Don Fernando had found\nin the volume of \"Amadis of Gaul,\" Cardenio said that he remembered it\nperfectly and that it was in these words:\n\"_Luscinda to Cardenio._\n\"Every day I discover merits in you that oblige and compel me to hold\nyou in higher estimation; so if you desire to relieve me of this\nobligation without cost to my honour, you may easily do so. I have a\nfather who knows you and loves me dearly, who without putting any\nconstraint on my inclination will grant what will be reasonable for you\nto have, if it be that you value me as you say and as I believe you\ndo.\"\n\"By this letter I was induced, as I told you, to demand Luscinda for my\nwife, and it was through it that Luscinda came to be regarded by Don\nFernando as one of the most discreet and prudent women of the day, and\nthis letter it was that suggested his design of ruining me before mine\ncould be carried into effect. I told Don Fernando that all Luscinda's\nfather was waiting for was that mine should ask her of him, which I did\nnot dare to suggest to him, fearing that he would not consent to do so;\nnot because he did not know perfectly well the rank, goodness, virtue,\nand beauty of Luscinda, and that she had qualities that would do honour\nto any family in Spain, but because I was aware that he did not wish me\nto marry so soon, before seeing what the Duke Ricardo would do for me.\nIn short, I told him I did not venture to mention it to my father, as\nwell on account of that difficulty, as of many others that discouraged\nme though I knew not well what they were, only that it seemed to me\nthat what I desired was never to come to pass. To all this Don Fernando\nanswered that he would take it upon himself to speak to my father, and\npersuade him to speak to Luscinda's father. O, ambitious Marius! O,\ncruel Catiline! O, wicked Sylla! O, perfidious Ganelon! O, treacherous\nVellido! O, vindictive Julian! O, covetous Judas! Traitor, cruel,\nvindictive, and perfidious, wherein had this poor wretch failed in his\nfidelity, who with such frankness showed thee the secrets and the joys\nof his heart? What offence did I commit? What words did I utter, or\nwhat counsels did I give that had not the furtherance of thy honour and\nwelfare for their aim? But, woe is me, wherefore do I complain? for\nsure it is that when misfortunes spring from the stars, descending from\non high they fall upon us with such fury and violence that no power on\nearth can check their course nor human device stay their coming. Who\ncould have thought that Don Fernando, a highborn gentleman,\nintelligent, bound to me by gratitude for my services, one that could\nwin the object of his love wherever he might set his affections, could\nhave become so obdurate, as they say, as to rob me of my one ewe lamb\nthat was not even yet in my possession? But laying aside these useless\nand unavailing reflections, let us take up the broken thread of my\nunhappy story.\n\"To proceed, then: Don Fernando finding my presence an obstacle to the\nexecution of his treacherous and wicked design, resolved to send me to\nhis elder brother under the pretext of asking money from him to pay for\nsix horses which, purposely, and with the sole object of sending me\naway that he might the better carry out his infernal scheme, he had\npurchased the very day he offered to speak to my father, and the price\nof which he now desired me to fetch. Could I have anticipated this\ntreachery? Could I by any chance have suspected it? Nay; so far from\nthat, I offered with the greatest pleasure to go at once, in my\nsatisfaction at the good bargain that had been made. That night I spoke\nwith Luscinda, and told her what had been agreed upon with Don\nFernando, and how I had strong hopes of our fair and reasonable wishes\nbeing realised. She, as unsuspicious as I was of the treachery of Don\nFernando, bade me try to return speedily, as she believed the\nfulfilment of our desires would be delayed only so long as my father\nput off speaking to hers. I know not why it was that on saying this to\nme her eyes filled with tears, and there came a lump in her throat that\nprevented her from uttering a word of many more that it seemed to me\nshe was striving to say to me. I was astonished at this unusual turn,\nwhich I never before observed in her, for we always conversed, whenever\ngood fortune and my ingenuity gave us the chance, with the greatest\ngaiety and cheerfulness, mingling tears, sighs, jealousies, doubts, or\nfears with our words; it was all on my part a eulogy of my good fortune\nthat Heaven should have given her to me for my mistress; I glorified\nher beauty, I extolled her worth and her understanding; and she paid me\nback by praising in me what in her love for me she thought worthy of\npraise; and besides we had a hundred thousand trifles and doings of our\nneighbours and acquaintances to talk about, and the utmost extent of my\nboldness was to take, almost by force, one of her fair white hands and\ncarry it to my lips, as well as the closeness of the low grating that\nseparated us allowed me. But the night before the unhappy day of my\ndeparture she wept, she moaned, she sighed, and she withdrew leaving me\nfilled with perplexity and amazement, overwhelmed at the sight of such\nstrange and affecting signs of grief and sorrow in Luscinda; but not to\ndash my hopes I ascribed it all to the depth of her love for me and the\npain that separation gives those who love tenderly. At last I took my\ndeparture, sad and dejected, my heart filled with fancies and\nsuspicions, but not knowing well what it was I suspected or fancied;\nplain omens pointing to the sad event and misfortune that was awaiting\nme.\n\"I reached the place whither I had been sent, gave the letter to Don\nFernando's brother, and was kindly received but not promptly dismissed,\nfor he desired me to wait, very much against my will, eight days in\nsome place where the duke his father was not likely to see me, as his\nbrother wrote that the money was to be sent without his knowledge; all\nof which was a scheme of the treacherous Don Fernando, for his brother\nhad no want of money to enable him to despatch me at once.\n\"The command was one that exposed me to the temptation of disobeying\nit, as it seemed to me impossible to endure life for so many days\nseparated from Luscinda, especially after leaving her in the sorrowful\nmood I have described to you; nevertheless as a dutiful servant I\nobeyed, though I felt it would be at the cost of my well-being. But\nfour days later there came a man in quest of me with a letter which he\ngave me, and which by the address I perceived to be from Luscinda, as\nthe writing was hers. I opened it with fear and trepidation, persuaded\nthat it must be something serious that had impelled her to write to me\nwhen at a distance, as she seldom did so when I was near. Before\nreading it I asked the man who it was that had given it to him, and how\nlong he had been upon the road; he told me that as he happened to be\npassing through one of the streets of the city at the hour of noon, a\nvery beautiful lady called to him from a window, and with tears in her\neyes said to him hurriedly, 'Brother, if you are, as you seem to be, a\nChristian, for the love of God I entreat you to have this letter\ndespatched without a moment's delay to the place and person named in\nthe address, all which is well known, and by this you will render a\ngreat service to our Lord; and that you may be at no inconvenience in\ndoing so take what is in this handkerchief;' and said he, 'with this\nshe threw me a handkerchief out of the window in which were tied up a\nhundred reals and this gold ring which I bring here together with the\nletter I have given you. And then without waiting for any answer she\nleft the window, though not before she saw me take the letter and the\nhandkerchief, and I had by signs let her know that I would do as she\nbade me; and so, seeing myself so well paid for the trouble I would\nhave in bringing it to you, and knowing by the address that it was to\nyou it was sent (for, se\u00f1or, I know you very well), and also unable to\nresist that beautiful lady's tears, I resolved to trust no one else,\nbut to come myself and give it to you, and in sixteen hours from the\ntime when it was given me I have made the journey, which, as you know,\nis eighteen leagues.'\n\"All the while the good-natured improvised courier was telling me this,\nI hung upon his words, my legs trembling under me so that I could\nscarcely stand. However, I opened the letter and read these words:\nThe promise Don Fernando gave you to urge your father to speak to mine,\nhe has fulfilled much more to his own satisfaction than to your\nadvantage. I have to tell you, se\u00f1or, that he has demanded me for a\nwife, and my father, led away by what he considers Don Fernando's\nsuperiority over you, has favoured his suit so cordially, that in two\ndays hence the betrothal is to take place with such secrecy and so\nprivately that the only witnesses are to be the Heavens above and a few\nof the household. Picture to yourself the state I am in; judge if it be\nurgent for you to come; the issue of the affair will show you whether I\nlove you or not. God grant this may come to your hand before mine shall\nbe forced to link itself with his who keeps so ill the faith that he\nhas pledged.\n\"Such, in brief, were the words of the letter, words that made me set\nout at once without waiting any longer for reply or money; for I now\nsaw clearly that it was not the purchase of horses but of his own\npleasure that had made Don Fernando send me to his brother. The\nexasperation I felt against Don Fernando, joined with the fear of\nlosing the prize I had won by so many years of love and devotion, lent\nme wings; so that almost flying I reached home the same day, by the\nhour which served for speaking with Luscinda. I arrived unobserved, and\nleft the mule on which I had come at the house of the worthy man who\nhad brought me the letter, and fortune was pleased to be for once so\nkind that I found Luscinda at the grating that was the witness of our\nloves. She recognised me at once, and I her, but not as she ought to\nhave recognised me, or I her. But who is there in the world that can\nboast of having fathomed or understood the wavering mind and unstable\nnature of a woman? Of a truth no one. To proceed: as soon as Luscinda\nsaw me she said, 'Cardenio, I am in my bridal dress, and the\ntreacherous Don Fernando and my covetous father are waiting for me in\nthe hall with the other witnesses, who shall be the witnesses of my\ndeath before they witness my betrothal. Be not distressed, my friend,\nbut contrive to be present at this sacrifice, and if that cannot be\nprevented by my words, I have a dagger concealed which will prevent\nmore deliberate violence, putting an end to my life and giving thee a\nfirst proof of the love I have borne and bear thee.' I replied to her\ndistractedly and hastily, in fear lest I should not have time to reply,\n'May thy words be verified by thy deeds, lady; and if thou hast a\ndagger to save thy honour, I have a sword to defend thee or kill myself\nif fortune be against us.'\n\"I think she could not have heard all these words, for I perceived that\nthey called her away in haste, as the bridegroom was waiting. Now the\nnight of my sorrow set in, the sun of my happiness went down, I felt my\neyes bereft of sight, my mind of reason. I could not enter the house,\nnor was I capable of any movement; but reflecting how important it was\nthat I should be present at what might take place on the occasion, I\nnerved myself as best I could and went in, for I well knew all the\nentrances and outlets; and besides, with the confusion that in secret\npervaded the house no one took notice of me, so, without being seen, I\nfound an opportunity of placing myself in the recess formed by a window\nof the hall itself, and concealed by the ends and borders of two\ntapestries, from between which I could, without being seen, see all\nthat took place in the room. Who could describe the agitation of heart\nI suffered as I stood there\u2014the thoughts that came to me\u2014the\nreflections that passed through my mind? They were such as cannot be,\nnor were it well they should be, told. Suffice it to say that the\nbridegroom entered the hall in his usual dress, without ornament of any\nkind; as groomsman he had with him a cousin of Luscinda's and except\nthe servants of the house there was no one else in the chamber. Soon\nafterwards Luscinda came out from an antechamber, attended by her\nmother and two of her damsels, arrayed and adorned as became her rank\nand beauty, and in full festival and ceremonial attire. My anxiety and\ndistraction did not allow me to observe or notice particularly what she\nwore; I could only perceive the colours, which were crimson and white,\nand the glitter of the gems and jewels on her head dress and apparel,\nsurpassed by the rare beauty of her lovely auburn hair that vying with\nthe precious stones and the light of the four torches that stood in the\nhall shone with a brighter gleam than all. Oh memory, mortal foe of my\npeace! why bring before me now the incomparable beauty of that adored\nenemy of mine? Were it not better, cruel memory, to remind me and\nrecall what she then did, that stirred by a wrong so glaring I may\nseek, if not vengeance now, at least to rid myself of life? Be not\nweary, sirs, of listening to these digressions; my sorrow is not one of\nthose that can or should be told tersely and briefly, for to me each\nincident seems to call for many words.\"\nTo this the curate replied that not only were they not weary of\nlistening to him, but that the details he mentioned interested them\ngreatly, being of a kind by no means to be omitted and deserving of the\nsame attention as the main story.\n\"To proceed, then,\" continued Cardenio: \"all being assembled in the\nhall, the priest of the parish came in and as he took the pair by the\nhand to perform the requisite ceremony, at the words, 'Will you, Se\u00f1ora\nLuscinda, take Se\u00f1or Don Fernando, here present, for your lawful\nhusband, as the holy Mother Church ordains?' I thrust my head and neck\nout from between the tapestries, and with eager ears and throbbing\nheart set myself to listen to Luscinda's answer, awaiting in her reply\nthe sentence of death or the grant of life. Oh, that I had but dared at\nthat moment to rush forward crying aloud, 'Luscinda, Luscinda! have a\ncare what thou dost; remember what thou owest me; bethink thee thou art\nmine and canst not be another's; reflect that thy utterance of \"Yes\"\nand the end of my life will come at the same instant. O, treacherous\nDon Fernando! robber of my glory, death of my life! What seekest thou?\nRemember that thou canst not as a Christian attain the object of thy\nwishes, for Luscinda is my bride, and I am her husband!' Fool that I\nam! now that I am far away, and out of danger, I say I should have done\nwhat I did not do: now that I have allowed my precious treasure to be\nrobbed from me, I curse the robber, on whom I might have taken\nvengeance had I as much heart for it as I have for bewailing my fate;\nin short, as I was then a coward and a fool, little wonder is it if I\nam now dying shame-stricken, remorseful, and mad.\n\"The priest stood waiting for the answer of Luscinda, who for a long\ntime withheld it; and just as I thought she was taking out the dagger\nto save her honour, or struggling for words to make some declaration of\nthe truth on my behalf, I heard her say in a faint and feeble voice, 'I\nwill:' Don Fernando said the same, and giving her the ring they stood\nlinked by a knot that could never be loosed. The bridegroom then\napproached to embrace his bride; and she, pressing her hand upon her\nheart, fell fainting in her mother's arms. It only remains now for me\nto tell you the state I was in when in that consent that I heard I saw\nall my hopes mocked, the words and promises of Luscinda proved\nfalsehoods, and the recovery of the prize I had that instant lost\nrendered impossible for ever. I stood stupefied, wholly abandoned, it\nseemed, by Heaven, declared the enemy of the earth that bore me, the\nair refusing me breath for my sighs, the water moisture for my tears;\nit was only the fire that gathered strength so that my whole frame\nglowed with rage and jealousy. They were all thrown into confusion by\nLuscinda's fainting, and as her mother was unlacing her to give her air\na sealed paper was discovered in her bosom which Don Fernando seized at\nonce and began to read by the light of one of the torches. As soon as\nhe had read it he seated himself in a chair, leaning his cheek on his\nhand in the attitude of one deep in thought, without taking any part in\nthe efforts that were being made to recover his bride from her fainting\nfit.\n\"Seeing all the household in confusion, I ventured to come out\nregardless whether I were seen or not, and determined, if I were, to do\nsome frenzied deed that would prove to all the world the righteous\nindignation of my breast in the punishment of the treacherous Don\nFernando, and even in that of the fickle fainting traitress. But my\nfate, doubtless reserving me for greater sorrows, if such there be, so\nordered it that just then I had enough and to spare of that reason\nwhich has since been wanting to me; and so, without seeking to take\nvengeance on my greatest enemies (which might have been easily taken,\nas all thought of me was so far from their minds), I resolved to take\nit upon myself, and on myself to inflict the pain they deserved,\nperhaps with even greater severity than I should have dealt out to them\nhad I then slain them; for sudden pain is soon over, but that which is\nprotracted by tortures is ever slaying without ending life. In a word,\nI quitted the house and reached that of the man with whom I had left my\nmule; I made him saddle it for me, mounted without bidding him\nfarewell, and rode out of the city, like another Lot, not daring to\nturn my head to look back upon it; and when I found myself alone in the\nopen country, screened by the darkness of the night, and tempted by the\nstillness to give vent to my grief without apprehension or fear of\nbeing heard or seen, then I broke silence and lifted up my voice in\nmaledictions upon Luscinda and Don Fernando, as if I could thus avenge\nthe wrong they had done me. I called her cruel, ungrateful, false,\nthankless, but above all covetous, since the wealth of my enemy had\nblinded the eyes of her affection, and turned it from me to transfer it\nto one to whom fortune had been more generous and liberal. And yet, in\nthe midst of this outburst of execration and upbraiding, I found\nexcuses for her, saying it was no wonder that a young girl in the\nseclusion of her parents' house, trained and schooled to obey them\nalways, should have been ready to yield to their wishes when they\noffered her for a husband a gentleman of such distinction, wealth, and\nnoble birth, that if she had refused to accept him she would have been\nthought out of her senses, or to have set her affection elsewhere, a\nsuspicion injurious to her fair name and fame. But then again, I said,\nhad she declared I was her husband, they would have seen that in\nchoosing me she had not chosen so ill but that they might excuse her,\nfor before Don Fernando had made his offer, they themselves could not\nhave desired, if their desires had been ruled by reason, a more\neligible husband for their daughter than I was; and she, before taking\nthe last fatal step of giving her hand, might easily have said that I\nhad already given her mine, for I should have come forward to support\nany assertion of hers to that effect. In short, I came to the\nconclusion that feeble love, little reflection, great ambition, and a\ncraving for rank, had made her forget the words with which she had\ndeceived me, encouraged and supported by my firm hopes and honourable\npassion.\n\"Thus soliloquising and agitated, I journeyed onward for the remainder\nof the night, and by daybreak I reached one of the passes of these\nmountains, among which I wandered for three days more without taking\nany path or road, until I came to some meadows lying on I know not\nwhich side of the mountains, and there I inquired of some herdsmen in\nwhat direction the most rugged part of the range lay. They told me that\nit was in this quarter, and I at once directed my course hither,\nintending to end my life here; but as I was making my way among these\ncrags, my mule dropped dead through fatigue and hunger, or, as I think\nmore likely, in order to have done with such a worthless burden as it\nbore in me. I was left on foot, worn out, famishing, without anyone to\nhelp me or any thought of seeking help: and so thus I lay stretched on\nthe ground, how long I know not, after which I rose up free from\nhunger, and found beside me some goatherds, who no doubt were the\npersons who had relieved me in my need, for they told me how they had\nfound me, and how I had been uttering ravings that showed plainly I had\nlost my reason; and since then I am conscious that I am not always in\nfull possession of it, but at times so deranged and crazed that I do a\nthousand mad things, tearing my clothes, crying aloud in these\nsolitudes, cursing my fate, and idly calling on the dear name of her\nwho is my enemy, and only seeking to end my life in lamentation; and\nwhen I recover my senses I find myself so exhausted and weary that I\ncan scarcely move. Most commonly my dwelling is the hollow of a cork\ntree large enough to shelter this miserable body; the herdsmen and\ngoatherds who frequent these mountains, moved by compassion, furnish me\nwith food, leaving it by the wayside or on the rocks, where they think\nI may perhaps pass and find it; and so, even though I may be then out\nof my senses, the wants of nature teach me what is required to sustain\nme, and make me crave it and eager to take it. At other times, so they\ntell me when they find me in a rational mood, I sally out upon the\nroad, and though they would gladly give it me, I snatch food by force\nfrom the shepherds bringing it from the village to their huts. Thus do\npass the wretched life that remains to me, until it be Heaven's will to\nbring it to a close, or so to order my memory that I no longer\nrecollect the beauty and treachery of Luscinda, or the wrong done me by\nDon Fernando; for if it will do this without depriving me of life, I\nwill turn my thoughts into some better channel; if not, I can only\nimplore it to have full mercy on my soul, for in myself I feel no power\nor strength to release my body from this strait in which I have of my\nown accord chosen to place it.\n\"Such, sirs, is the dismal story of my misfortune: say if it be one\nthat can be told with less emotion than you have seen in me; and do not\ntrouble yourselves with urging or pressing upon me what reason suggests\nas likely to serve for my relief, for it will avail me as much as the\nmedicine prescribed by a wise physician avails the sick man who will\nnot take it. I have no wish for health without Luscinda; and since it\nis her pleasure to be another's, when she is or should be mine, let it\nbe mine to be a prey to misery when I might have enjoyed happiness. She\nby her fickleness strove to make my ruin irretrievable; I will strive\nto gratify her wishes by seeking destruction; and it will show\ngenerations to come that I alone was deprived of that of which all\nothers in misfortune have a superabundance, for to them the\nimpossibility of being consoled is itself a consolation, while to me it\nis the cause of greater sorrows and sufferings, for I think that even\nin death there will not be an end of them.\"\nHere Cardenio brought to a close his long discourse and story, as full",

If\nthe solitude these mountains promise deceives me not, it is so; ah! woe\nis me! how much more grateful to my mind will be the society of these\nrocks and brakes that permit me to complain of my misfortune to Heaven,\nthan that of any human being, for there is none on earth to look to for\ncounsel in doubt, comfort in sorrow, or relief in distress!\"\nAll this was heard distinctly by the curate and those with him, and as\nit seemed to them to be uttered close by, as indeed it was, they got up\nto look for the speaker, and before they had gone twenty paces they\ndiscovered behind a rock, seated at the foot of an ash tree, a youth in\nthe dress of a peasant, whose face they were unable at the moment to\nsee as he was leaning forward, bathing his feet in the brook that\nflowed past. They approached so silently that he did not perceive them,\nbeing fully occupied in bathing his feet, which were so fair that they\nlooked like two pieces of shining crystal brought forth among the other\nstones of the brook. The whiteness and beauty of these feet struck them\nwith surprise, for they did not seem to have been made to crush clods\nor to follow the plough and the oxen as their owner's dress suggested;\nand so, finding they had not been noticed, the curate, who was in\nfront, made a sign to the other two to conceal themselves behind some\nfragments of rock that lay there; which they did, observing closely\nwhat the youth was about. He had on a loose double-skirted dark brown\njacket bound tight to his body with a white cloth; he wore besides\nbreeches and gaiters of brown cloth, and on his head a brown montera;\nand he had the gaiters turned up as far as the middle of the leg, which\nverily seemed to be of pure alabaster.",

The long auburn tresses not only covered her\nshoulders, but such was their length and abundance, concealed her all\nround beneath their masses, so that except the feet nothing of her form\nwas visible. She now used her hands as a comb, and if her feet had\nseemed like bits of crystal in the water, her hands looked like pieces\nof driven snow among her locks; all which increased not only the\nadmiration of the three beholders, but their anxiety to learn who she\nwas. With this object they resolved to show themselves, and at the stir\nthey made in getting upon their feet the fair damsel raised her head,\nand parting her hair from before her eyes with both hands, she looked\nto see who had made the noise, and the instant she perceived them she\nstarted to her feet, and without waiting to put on her shoes or gather\nup her hair, hastily snatched up a bundle as though of clothes that she\nhad beside her, and, scared and alarmed, endeavoured to take flight;\nbut before she had gone six paces she fell to the ground, her delicate\nfeet being unable to bear the roughness of the stones; seeing which,\nthe three hastened towards her, and the curate addressing her first\nsaid:\n\"Stay, se\u00f1ora, whoever you may be, for those whom you see here only\ndesire to be of service to you; you have no need to attempt a flight so\nheedless, for neither can your feet bear it, nor we allow it.\"\nTaken by surprise and bewildered, she made no reply to these words.\nThey, however, came towards her, and the curate taking her hand went on\nto say:\n\"What your dress would hide, se\u00f1ora, is made known to us by your hair;\na clear proof that it can be no trifling cause that has disguised your\nbeauty in a garb so unworthy of it, and sent it into solitudes like\nthese where we have had the good fortune to find you, if not to relieve\nyour distress, at least to offer you comfort; for no distress, so long\nas life lasts, can be so oppressive or reach such a height as to make\nthe sufferer refuse to listen to comfort offered with good intention.\nAnd so, se\u00f1ora, or se\u00f1or, or whatever you prefer to be, dismiss the\nfears that our appearance has caused you and make us acquainted with\nyour good or evil fortunes, for from all of us together, or from each\none of us, you will receive sympathy in your trouble.\"\nWhile the curate was speaking, the disguised damsel stood as if\nspell-bound, looking at them without opening her lips or uttering a\nword, just like a village rustic to whom something strange that he has\nnever seen before has been suddenly shown; but on the curate addressing\nsome further words to the same effect to her, sighing deeply she broke\nsilence and said:\n\"Since the solitude of these mountains has been unable to conceal me,\nand the escape of my dishevelled tresses will not allow my tongue to\ndeal in falsehoods, it would be idle for me now to make any further\npretence of what, if you were to believe me, you would believe more out\nof courtesy than for any other reason. This being so, I say I thank\nyou, sirs, for the offer you have made me, which places me under the\nobligation of complying with the request you have made of me; though I\nfear the account I shall give you of my misfortunes will excite in you\nas much concern as compassion, for you will be unable to suggest\nanything to remedy them or any consolation to alleviate them. However,\nthat my honour may not be left a matter of doubt in your minds, now\nthat you have discovered me to be a woman, and see that I am young,\nalone, and in this dress, things that taken together or separately\nwould be enough to destroy any good name, I feel bound to tell what I\nwould willingly keep secret if I could.\"\nAll this she who was now seen to be a lovely woman delivered without\nany hesitation, with so much ease and in so sweet a voice that they\nwere not less charmed by her intelligence than by her beauty, and as\nthey again repeated their offers and entreaties to her to fulfil her\npromise, she without further pressing, first modestly covering her feet\nand gathering up her hair, seated herself on a stone with the three",

This\nnobleman has two sons, the elder heir to his dignity and apparently to\nhis good qualities; the younger heir to I know not what, unless it be\nthe treachery of Vellido and the falsehood of Ganelon. My parents are\nthis lord's vassals, lowly in origin, but so wealthy that if birth had\nconferred as much on them as fortune, they would have had nothing left\nto desire, nor should I have had reason to fear trouble like that in\nwhich I find myself now; for it may be that my ill fortune came of\ntheirs in not having been nobly born. It is true they are not so low\nthat they have any reason to be ashamed of their condition, but neither\nare they so high as to remove from my mind the impression that my\nmishap comes of their humble birth. They are, in short, peasants, plain\nhomely people, without any taint of disreputable blood, and, as the\nsaying is, old rusty Christians, but so rich that by their wealth and\nfree-handed way of life they are coming by degrees to be considered\ngentlefolk by birth, and even by position; though the wealth and\nnobility they thought most of was having me for their daughter; and as\nthey have no other child to make their heir, and are affectionate\nparents, I was one of the most indulged daughters that ever parents\nindulged.\n\"I was the mirror in which they beheld themselves, the staff of their\nold age, and the object in which, with submission to Heaven, all their\nwishes centred, and mine were in accordance with theirs, for I knew\ntheir worth; and as I was mistress of their hearts, so was I also of\ntheir possessions. Through me they engaged or dismissed their servants;\nthrough my hands passed the accounts and returns of what was sown and\nreaped; the oil-mills, the wine-presses, the count of the flocks and\nherds, the beehives, all in short that a rich farmer like my father has\nor can have, I had under my care, and I acted as steward and mistress\nwith an assiduity on my part and satisfaction on theirs that I cannot\nwell describe to you. The leisure hours left to me after I had given\nthe requisite orders to the head-shepherds, overseers, and other\nlabourers, I passed in such employments as are not only allowable but\nnecessary for young girls, those that the needle, embroidery cushion,\nand spinning wheel usually afford, and if to refresh my mind I quitted\nthem for a while, I found recreation in reading some devotional book or\nplaying the harp, for experience taught me that music soothes the\ntroubled mind and relieves weariness of spirit. Such was the life I led\nin my parents' house and if I have depicted it thus minutely, it is not\nout of ostentation, or to let you know that I am rich, but that you may\nsee how, without any fault of mine, I have fallen from the happy\ncondition I have described, to the misery I am in at present. The truth\nis, that while I was leading this busy life, in a retirement that might\ncompare with that of a monastery, and unseen as I thought by any except\nthe servants of the house (for when I went to Mass it was so early in\nthe morning, and I was so closely attended by my mother and the women\nof the household, and so thickly veiled and so shy, that my eyes\nscarcely saw more ground than I trod on), in spite of all this, the\neyes of love, or idleness, more properly speaking, that the lynx's\ncannot rival, discovered me, with the help of the assiduity of Don\nFernando; for that is the name of the younger son of the duke I told\nof.\"",

            "text": "The moment the speaker mentioned the name of Don Fernando, Cardenio\nchanged colour and broke into a sweat, with such signs of emotion that\nthe curate and the barber, who observed it, feared that one of the mad\nfits which they heard attacked him sometimes was coming upon him; but\nCardenio showed no further agitation and remained quiet, regarding the\npeasant girl with fixed attention, for he began to suspect who she was.\nShe, however, without noticing the excitement of Cardenio, continuing\nher story, went on to say:\n\"And they had hardly discovered me, when, as he owned afterwards, he\nwas smitten with a violent love for me, as the manner in which it\ndisplayed itself plainly showed. But to shorten the long recital of my\nwoes, I will pass over in silence all the artifices employed by Don\nFernando for declaring his passion for me. He bribed all the household,\nhe gave and offered gifts and presents to my parents; every day was\nlike a holiday or a merry-making in our street; by night no one could\nsleep for the music; the love letters that used to come to my hand, no\none knew how, were innumerable, full of tender pleadings and pledges,\ncontaining more promises and oaths than there were letters in them; all\nwhich not only did not soften me, but hardened my heart against him, as\nif he had been my mortal enemy, and as if everything he did to make me\nyield were done with the opposite intention. Not that the high-bred\nbearing of Don Fernando was disagreeable to me, or that I found his\nimportunities wearisome; for it gave me a certain sort of satisfaction\nto find myself so sought and prized by a gentleman of such distinction,\nand I was not displeased at seeing my praises in his letters (for\nhowever ugly we women may be, it seems to me it always pleases us to\nhear ourselves called beautiful) but that my own sense of right was\nopposed to all this, as well as the repeated advice of my parents, who\nnow very plainly perceived Don Fernando's purpose, for he cared very\nlittle if all the world knew it. They told me they trusted and confided\ntheir honour and good name to my virtue and rectitude alone, and bade\nme consider the disparity between Don Fernando and myself, from which I\nmight conclude that his intentions, whatever he might say to the\ncontrary, had for their aim his own pleasure rather than my advantage;\nand if I were at all desirous of opposing an obstacle to his\nunreasonable suit, they were ready, they said, to marry me at once to\nanyone I preferred, either among the leading people of our own town, or\nof any of those in the neighbourhood; for with their wealth and my good\nname, a match might be looked for in any quarter. This offer, and their\nsound advice strengthened my resolution, and I never gave Don Fernando\na word in reply that could hold out to him any hope of success, however\nremote.\nc28c.jpg (279K)\nFull Size\n\"All this caution of mine, which he must have taken for coyness, had\napparently the effect of increasing his wanton appetite\u2014for that is the\nname I give to his passion for me; had it been what he declared it to\nbe, you would not know of it now, because there would have been no\noccasion to tell you of it. At length he learned that my parents were\ncontemplating marriage for me in order to put an end to his hopes of\nobtaining possession of me, or at least to secure additional protectors\nto watch over me, and this intelligence or suspicion made him act as\nyou shall hear. One night, as I was in my chamber with no other\ncompanion than a damsel who waited on me, with the doors carefully\nlocked lest my honour should be imperilled through any carelessness, I\nknow not nor can conceive how it happened, but, with all this seclusion\nand these precautions, and in the solitude and silence of my\nretirement, I found him standing before me, a vision that so astounded\nme that it deprived my eyes of sight, and my tongue of speech. I had no\npower to utter a cry, nor, I think, did he give me time to utter one,\nas he immediately approached me, and taking me in his arms (for,\noverwhelmed as I was, I was powerless, I say, to help myself), he began\nto make such professions to me that I know not how falsehood could have\nhad the power of dressing them up to seem so like truth; and the\ntraitor contrived that his tears should vouch for his words, and his\nsighs for his sincerity.\n\"I, a poor young creature alone, ill versed among my people in cases\nsuch as this, began, I know not how, to think all these lying\nprotestations true, though without being moved by his sighs and tears\nto anything more than pure compassion; and so, as the first feeling of\nbewilderment passed away, and I began in some degree to recover myself,\nI said to him with more courage than I thought I could have possessed,\n'If, as I am now in your arms, se\u00f1or, I were in the claws of a fierce\nlion, and my deliverance could be procured by doing or saying anything\nto the prejudice of my honour, it would no more be in my power to do it\nor say it, than it would be possible that what was should not have\nbeen; so then, if you hold my body clasped in your arms, I hold my soul\nsecured by virtuous intentions, very different from yours, as you will\nsee if you attempt to carry them into effect by force. I am your\nvassal, but I am not your slave; your nobility neither has nor should\nhave any right to dishonour or degrade my humble birth; and low-born\npeasant as I am, I have my self-respect as much as you, a lord and\ngentleman: with me your violence will be to no purpose, your wealth\nwill have no weight, your words will have no power to deceive me, nor\nyour sighs or tears to soften me: were I to see any of the things I\nspeak of in him whom my parents gave me as a husband, his will should\nbe mine, and mine should be bounded by his; and my honour being\npreserved even though my inclinations were not would willingly yield\nhim what you, se\u00f1or, would now obtain by force; and this I say lest you\nshould suppose that any but my lawful husband shall ever win anything\nof me.' 'If that,' said this disloyal gentleman, 'be the only scruple\nyou feel, fairest Dorothea' (for that is the name of this unhappy\nbeing), 'see here I give you my hand to be yours, and let Heaven, from\nwhich nothing is hid, and this image of Our Lady you have here, be\nwitnesses of this pledge.'\"",

            "text": "c28d.jpg (289K)\nFull Size\nWhen Cardenio heard her say she was called Dorothea, he showed fresh\nagitation and felt convinced of the truth of his former suspicion, but\nhe was unwilling to interrupt the story, and wished to hear the end of\nwhat he already all but knew, so he merely said:\n\"What! is Dorothea your name, se\u00f1ora? I have heard of another of the\nsame name who can perhaps match your misfortunes. But proceed;\nby-and-by I may tell you something that will astonish you as much as it\nwill excite your compassion.\"\nDorothea was struck by Cardenio's words as well as by his strange and\nmiserable attire, and begged him if he knew anything concerning her to\ntell it to her at once, for if fortune had left her any blessing it was\ncourage to bear whatever calamity might fall upon her, as she felt sure\nthat none could reach her capable of increasing in any degree what she\nendured already.\n\"I would not let the occasion pass, se\u00f1ora,\" replied Cardenio, \"of\ntelling you what I think, if what I suspect were the truth, but so far\nthere has been no opportunity, nor is it of any importance to you to\nknow it.\"\n\"Be it as it may,\" replied Dorothea, \"what happened in my story was\nthat Don Fernando, taking an image that stood in the chamber, placed it\nas a witness of our betrothal, and with the most binding words and\nextravagant oaths gave me his promise to become my husband; though\nbefore he had made an end of pledging himself I bade him consider well\nwhat he was doing, and think of the anger his father would feel at\nseeing him married to a peasant girl and one of his vassals; I told him\nnot to let my beauty, such as it was, blind him, for that was not\nenough to furnish an excuse for his transgression; and if in the love\nhe bore me he wished to do me any kindness, it would be to leave my lot\nto follow its course at the level my condition required; for marriages\nso unequal never brought happiness, nor did they continue long to\nafford the enjoyment they began with.\n\"All this that I have now repeated I said to him, and much more which I\ncannot recollect; but it had no effect in inducing him to forego his\npurpose; he who has no intention of paying does not trouble himself\nabout difficulties when he is striking the bargain. At the same time I\nargued the matter briefly in my own mind, saying to myself, 'I shall\nnot be the first who has risen through marriage from a lowly to a lofty\nstation, nor will Don Fernando be the first whom beauty or, as is more\nlikely, a blind attachment, has led to mate himself below his rank.\nThen, since I am introducing no new usage or practice, I may as well\navail myself of the honour that chance offers me, for even though his\ninclination for me should not outlast the attainment of his wishes, I\nshall be, after all, his wife before God. And if I strive to repel him\nby scorn, I can see that, fair means failing, he is in a mood to use\nforce, and I shall be left dishonoured and without any means of proving\nmy innocence to those who cannot know how innocently I have come to be\nin this position; for what arguments would persuade my parents that\nthis gentleman entered my chamber without my consent?'\n\"All these questions and answers passed through my mind in a moment;\nbut the oaths of Don Fernando, the witnesses he appealed to, the tears\nhe shed, and lastly the charms of his person and his high-bred grace,\nwhich, accompanied by such signs of genuine love, might well have\nconquered a heart even more free and coy than mine\u2014these were the\nthings that more than all began to influence me and lead me unawares to\nmy ruin. I called my waiting-maid to me, that there might be a witness\non earth besides those in Heaven, and again Don Fernando renewed and\nrepeated his oaths, invoked as witnesses fresh saints in addition to\nthe former ones, called down upon himself a thousand curses hereafter\nshould he fail to keep his promise, shed more tears, redoubled his\nsighs and pressed me closer in his arms, from which he had never\nallowed me to escape; and so I was left by my maid, and ceased to be\none, and he became a traitor and a perjured man.\n\"The day which followed the night of my misfortune did not come so\nquickly, I imagine, as Don Fernando wished, for when desire has\nattained its object, the greatest pleasure is to fly from the scene of\npleasure. I say so because Don Fernando made all haste to leave me, and\nby the adroitness of my maid, who was indeed the one who had admitted\nhim, gained the street before daybreak; but on taking leave of me he\ntold me, though not with as much earnestness and fervour as when he\ncame, that I might rest assured of his faith and of the sanctity and\nsincerity of his oaths; and to confirm his words he drew a rich ring\noff his finger and placed it upon mine. He then took his departure and\nI was left, I know not whether sorrowful or happy; all I can say is, I\nwas left agitated and troubled in mind and almost bewildered by what\nhad taken place, and I had not the spirit, or else it did not occur to\nme, to chide my maid for the treachery she had been guilty of in\nconcealing Don Fernando in my chamber; for as yet I was unable to make\nup my mind whether what had befallen me was for good or evil. I told\nDon Fernando at parting, that as I was now his, he might see me on\nother nights in the same way, until it should be his pleasure to let\nthe matter become known; but, except the following night, he came no\nmore, nor for more than a month could I catch a glimpse of him in the\nstreet or in church, while I wearied myself with watching for one;\nalthough I knew he was in the town, and almost every day went out\nhunting, a pastime he was very fond of. I remember well how sad and\ndreary those days and hours were to me; I remember well how I began to\ndoubt as they went by, and even to lose confidence in the faith of Don\nFernando; and I remember, too, how my maid heard those words in reproof\nof her audacity that she had not heard before, and how I was forced to\nput a constraint on my tears and on the expression of my countenance,\nnot to give my parents cause to ask me why I was so melancholy, and\ndrive me to invent falsehoods in reply. But all this was suddenly\nbrought to an end, for the time came when all such considerations were\ndisregarded, and there was no further question of honour, when my\npatience gave way and the secret of my heart became known abroad. The\nreason was, that a few days later it was reported in the town that Don\nFernando had been married in a neighbouring city to a maiden of rare\nbeauty, the daughter of parents of distinguished position, though not",

Dorothea, however, did not interrupt her\nstory, but went on in these words:\n\"This sad intelligence reached my ears, and, instead of being struck\nwith a chill, with such wrath and fury did my heart burn that I\nscarcely restrained myself from rushing out into the streets, crying\naloud and proclaiming openly the perfidy and treachery of which I was\nthe victim; but this transport of rage was for the time checked by a\nresolution I formed, to be carried out the same night, and that was to\nassume this dress, which I got from a servant of my father's, one of\nthe zagals, as they are called in farmhouses, to whom I confided the\nwhole of my misfortune, and whom I entreated to accompany me to the\ncity where I heard my enemy was. He, though he remonstrated with me for\nmy boldness, and condemned my resolution, when he saw me bent upon my\npurpose, offered to bear me company, as he said, to the end of the\nworld. I at once packed up in a linen pillow-case a woman's dress, and\nsome jewels and money to provide for emergencies, and in the silence of\nthe night, without letting my treacherous maid know, I sallied forth\nfrom the house, accompanied by my servant and abundant anxieties, and\non foot set out for the city, but borne as it were on wings by my\neagerness to reach it, if not to prevent what I presumed to be already\ndone, at least to call upon Don Fernando to tell me with what\nconscience he had done it. I reached my destination in two days and a\nhalf, and on entering the city inquired for the house of Luscinda's\nparents. The first person I asked gave me more in reply than I sought\nto know; he showed me the house, and told me all that had occurred at\nthe betrothal of the daughter of the family, an affair of such\nnotoriety in the city that it was the talk of every knot of idlers in\nthe street. He said that on the night of Don Fernando's betrothal with\nLuscinda, as soon as she had consented to be his bride by saying 'Yes,'\nshe was taken with a sudden fainting fit, and that on the bridegroom\napproaching to unlace the bosom of her dress to give her air, he found\na paper in her own handwriting, in which she said and declared that she\ncould not be Don Fernando's bride, because she was already Cardenio's,\nwho, according to the man's account, was a gentleman of distinction of\nthe same city; and that if she had accepted Don Fernando, it was only\nin obedience to her parents. In short, he said, the words of the paper\nmade it clear she meant to kill herself on the completion of the\nbetrothal, and gave her reasons for putting an end to herself all which\nwas confirmed, it was said, by a dagger they found somewhere in her\nclothes. On seeing this, Don Fernando, persuaded that Luscinda had\nbefooled, slighted, and trifled with him, assailed her before she had\nrecovered from her swoon, and tried to stab her with the dagger that\nhad been found, and would have succeeded had not her parents and those\nwho were present prevented him. It was said, moreover, that Don\nFernando went away at once, and that Luscinda did not recover from her\nprostration until the next day, when she told her parents how she was\nreally the bride of that Cardenio I have mentioned. I learned besides\nthat Cardenio, according to report, had been present at the betrothal;\nand that upon seeing her betrothed contrary to his expectation, he had\nquitted the city in despair, leaving behind him a letter declaring the\nwrong Luscinda had done him, and his intention of going where no one\nshould ever see him again. All this was a matter of notoriety in the\ncity, and everyone spoke of it; especially when it became known that\nLuscinda was missing from her father's house and from the city, for she\nwas not to be found anywhere, to the distraction of her parents, who\nknew not what steps to take to recover her. What I learned revived my\nhopes, and I was better pleased not to have found Don Fernando than to\nfind him married, for it seemed to me that the door was not yet\nentirely shut upon relief in my case, and I thought that perhaps Heaven\nhad put this impediment in the way of the second marriage, to lead him\nto recognise his obligations under the former one, and reflect that as\na Christian he was bound to consider his soul above all human objects.\nAll this passed through my mind, and I strove to comfort myself without\ncomfort, indulging in faint and distant hopes of cherishing that life\nthat I now abhor.\n\"But while I was in the city, uncertain what to do, as I could not find\nDon Fernando, I heard notice given by the public crier offering a great\nreward to anyone who should find me, and giving the particulars of my\nage and of the very dress I wore; and I heard it said that the lad who\ncame with me had taken me away from my father's house; a thing that cut\nme to the heart, showing how low my good name had fallen, since it was\nnot enough that I should lose it by my flight, but they must add with\nwhom I had fled, and that one so much beneath me and so unworthy of my\nconsideration. The instant I heard the notice I quitted the city with\nmy servant, who now began to show signs of wavering in his fidelity to\nme, and the same night, for fear of discovery, we entered the most\nthickly wooded part of these mountains. But, as is commonly said, one\nevil calls up another and the end of one misfortune is apt to be the\nbeginning of one still greater, and so it proved in my case; for my\nworthy servant, until then so faithful and trusty when he found me in\nthis lonely spot, moved more by his own villainy than by my beauty,\nsought to take advantage of the opportunity which these solitudes\nseemed to present him, and with little shame and less fear of God and\nrespect for me, began to make overtures to me; and finding that I\nreplied to the effrontery of his proposals with justly severe language,\nhe laid aside the entreaties which he had employed at first, and began\nto use violence.\nc28e.jpg (324K)\nFull Size\n\"But just Heaven, that seldom fails to watch over and aid good\nintentions, so aided mine that with my slight strength and with little\nexertion I pushed him over a precipice, where I left him, whether dead\nor alive I know not; and then, with greater speed than seemed possible\nin my terror and fatigue, I made my way into the mountains, without any\nother thought or purpose save that of hiding myself among them, and\nescaping my father and those despatched in search of me by his orders.\nIt is now I know not how many months since with this object I came\nhere, where I met a herdsman who engaged me as his servant at a place\nin the heart of this Sierra, and all this time I have been serving him\nas herd, striving to keep always afield to hide these locks which have\nnow unexpectedly betrayed me. But all my care and pains were\nunavailing, for my master made the discovery that I was not a man, and\nharboured the same base designs as my servant; and as fortune does not\nalways supply a remedy in cases of difficulty, and I had no precipice\nor ravine at hand down which to fling the master and cure his passion,\nas I had in the servant's case, I thought it a lesser evil to leave him\nand again conceal myself among these crags, than make trial of my\nstrength and argument with him. So, as I say, once more I went into\nhiding to seek for some place where I might with sighs and tears\nimplore Heaven to have pity on my misery, and grant me help and\nstrength to escape from it, or let me die among the solitudes, leaving\nno trace of an unhappy being who, by no fault of hers, has furnished",

For so far, if I remember rightly, I have not mentioned it in the\nwhole story of my misfortunes.\"\n\"I am that unhappy being, se\u00f1ora,\" replied Cardenio, \"whom, as you have\nsaid, Luscinda declared to be her husband; I am the unfortunate\nCardenio, whom the wrong-doing of him who has brought you to your\npresent condition has reduced to the state you see me in, bare, ragged,\nbereft of all human comfort, and what is worse, of reason, for I only\npossess it when Heaven is pleased for some short space to restore it to\nme. I, Dorothea, am he who witnessed the wrong done by Don Fernando,\nand waited to hear the 'Yes' uttered by which Luscinda owned herself\nhis betrothed: I am he who had not courage enough to see how her\nfainting fit ended, or what came of the paper that was found in her\nbosom, because my heart had not the fortitude to endure so many strokes\nof ill-fortune at once; and so losing patience I quitted the house, and\nleaving a letter with my host, which I entreated him to place in\nLuscinda's hands, I betook myself to these solitudes, resolved to end\nhere the life I hated as if it were my mortal enemy. But fate would not\nrid me of it, contenting itself with robbing me of my reason, perhaps\nto preserve me for the good fortune I have had in meeting you; for if\nthat which you have just told us be true, as I believe it to be, it may\nbe that Heaven has yet in store for both of us a happier termination to\nour misfortunes than we look for; because seeing that Luscinda cannot\nmarry Don Fernando, being mine, as she has herself so openly declared,\nand that Don Fernando cannot marry her as he is yours, we may\nreasonably hope that Heaven will restore to us what is ours, as it is\nstill in existence and not yet alienated or destroyed. And as we have\nthis consolation springing from no very visionary hope or wild fancy, I\nentreat you, se\u00f1ora, to form new resolutions in your better mind, as I\nmean to do in mine, preparing yourself to look forward to happier\nfortunes; for I swear to you by the faith of a gentleman and a\nChristian not to desert you until I see you in possession of Don\nFernando, and if I cannot by words induce him to recognise his\nobligation to you, in that case to avail myself of the right which my\nrank as a gentleman gives me, and with just cause challenge him on\naccount of the injury he has done you, not regarding my own wrongs,\nwhich I shall leave to Heaven to avenge, while I on earth devote myself\nto yours.\"",

Having\neffected this, although the others had gone on ahead while they were\ndisguising themselves, they easily came out on the high road before\nthem, for the brambles and awkward places they encountered did not\nallow those on horseback to go as fast as those on foot. They then\nposted themselves on the level ground at the outlet of the Sierra, and\nas soon as Don Quixote and his companions emerged from it the curate\nbegan to examine him very deliberately, as though he were striving to\nrecognise him, and after having stared at him for some time he hastened\ntowards him with open arms exclaiming, \"A happy meeting with the mirror\nof chivalry, my worthy compatriot Don Quixote of La Mancha, the flower\nand cream of high breeding, the protection and relief of the\ndistressed, the quintessence of knights-errant!\" And so saying he\nclasped in his arms the knee of Don Quixote's left leg. He, astonished\nat the stranger's words and behaviour, looked at him attentively, and\nat length recognised him, very much surprised to see him there, and\nmade great efforts to dismount. This, however, the curate would not\nallow, on which Don Quixote said, \"Permit me, se\u00f1or licentiate, for it\nis not fitting that I should be on horseback and so reverend a person\nas your worship on foot.\"\n\"On no account will I allow it,\" said the curate; \"your mightiness must\nremain on horseback, for it is on horseback you achieve the greatest\ndeeds and adventures that have been beheld in our age; as for me, an\nunworthy priest, it will serve me well enough to mount on the haunches\nof one of the mules of these gentlefolk who accompany your worship, if\nthey have no objection, and I will fancy I am mounted on the steed\nPegasus, or on the zebra or charger that bore the famous Moor,\nMuzaraque, who to this day lies enchanted in the great hill of Zulema,\na little distance from the great Complutum.\"\n\"Nor even that will I consent to, se\u00f1or licentiate,\" answered Don\nQuixote, \"and I know it will be the good pleasure of my lady the\nprincess, out of love for me, to order her squire to give up the saddle\nof his mule to your worship, and he can sit behind if the beast will\nbear it.\"\n\"It will, I am sure,\" said the princess, \"and I am sure, too, that I\nneed not order my squire, for he is too courteous and considerate to\nallow a Churchman to go on foot when he might be mounted.\"\n\"That he is,\" said the barber, and at once alighting, he offered his\nsaddle to the curate, who accepted it without much entreaty; but\nunfortunately as the barber was mounting behind, the mule, being as it\nhappened a hired one, which is the same thing as saying\nill-conditioned, lifted its hind hoofs and let fly a couple of kicks in\nthe air, which would have made Master Nicholas wish his expedition in\nquest of Don Quixote at the devil had they caught him on the breast or\nhead. As it was, they so took him by surprise that he came to the\nground, giving so little heed to his beard that it fell off, and all he\ncould do when he found himself without it was to cover his face hastily\nwith both his hands and moan that his teeth were knocked out. Don\nQuixote when he saw all that bundle of beard detached, without jaws or\nblood, from the face of the fallen squire, exclaimed:\n\"By the living God, but this is a great miracle! it has knocked off and\nplucked away the beard from his face as if it had been shaved off\ndesignedly.\"\nThe curate, seeing the danger of discovery that threatened his scheme,\nat once pounced upon the beard and hastened with it to where Master\nNicholas lay, still uttering moans, and drawing his head to his breast\nhad it on in an instant, muttering over him some words which he said\nwere a certain special charm for sticking on beards, as they would see;\nand as soon as he had it fixed he left him, and the squire appeared\nwell bearded and whole as before, whereat Don Quixote was beyond\nmeasure astonished, and begged the curate to teach him that charm when\nhe had an opportunity, as he was persuaded its virtue must extend\nbeyond the sticking on of beards, for it was clear that where the beard\nhad been stripped off the flesh must have remained torn and lacerated,\nand when it could heal all that it must be good for more than beards.\n\"And so it is,\" said the curate, and he promised to teach it to him on\nthe first opportunity. They then agreed that for the present the curate\nshould mount, and that the three should ride by turns until they\nreached the inn, which might be about six leagues from where they were.",

I will only say, se\u00f1ora, that whether it\nhas might or not, that which it may or may not have shall be devoted to\nyour service even to death; and now, leaving this to its proper season,\nI would ask the se\u00f1or licentiate to tell me what it is that has brought\nhim into these parts, alone, unattended, and so lightly clad that I am\nfilled with amazement.\"\n\"I will answer that briefly,\" replied the curate; \"you must know then,\nSe\u00f1or Don Quixote, that Master Nicholas, our friend and barber, and I\nwere going to Seville to receive some money that a relative of mine who\nwent to the Indies many years ago had sent me, and not such a small sum\nbut that it was over sixty thousand pieces of eight, full weight, which\nis something; and passing by this place yesterday we were attacked by\nfour footpads, who stripped us even to our beards, and them they\nstripped off so that the barber found it necessary to put on a false\none, and even this young man here\"\u2014pointing to Cardenio\u2014\"they\ncompletely transformed. But the best of it is, the story goes in the\nneighbourhood that those who attacked us belong to a number of galley\nslaves who, they say, were set free almost on the very same spot by a\nman of such valour that, in spite of the commissary and of the guards,\nhe released the whole of them; and beyond all doubt he must have been\nout of his senses, or he must be as great a scoundrel as they, or some\nman without heart or conscience to let the wolf loose among the sheep,\nthe fox among the hens, the fly among the honey. He has defrauded\njustice, and opposed his king and lawful master, for he opposed his\njust commands; he has, I say, robbed the galleys of their feet, stirred\nup the Holy Brotherhood which for many years past has been quiet, and,\nlastly, has done a deed by which his soul may be lost without any gain\nto his body.\" Sancho had told the curate and the barber of the\nadventure of the galley slaves, which, so much to his glory, his master\nhad achieved, and hence the curate in alluding to it made the most of\nit to see what would be said or done by Don Quixote; who changed colour\nat every word, not daring to say that it was he who had been the\nliberator of those worthy people. \"These, then,\" said the curate, \"were\nthey who robbed us; and God in his mercy pardon him who would not let\nthem go to the punishment they deserved.\"\nc29f.jpg (53K)",

The king my father, who was called Tinacrio\nthe Sapient, was very learned in what they call magic arts, and became\naware by his craft that my mother, who was called Queen Jaramilla, was\nto die before he did, and that soon after he too was to depart this\nlife, and I was to be left an orphan without father or mother. But all\nthis, he declared, did not so much grieve or distress him as his\ncertain knowledge that a prodigious giant, the lord of a great island\nclose to our kingdom, Pandafilando of the Scowl by name\u2014for it is\naverred that, though his eyes are properly placed and straight, he\nalways looks askew as if he squinted, and this he does out of\nmalignity, to strike fear and terror into those he looks at\u2014that he\nknew, I say, that this giant on becoming aware of my orphan condition\nwould overrun my kingdom with a mighty force and strip me of all, not\nleaving me even a small village to shelter me; but that I could avoid\nall this ruin and misfortune if I were willing to marry him; however,\nas far as he could see, he never expected that I would consent to a\nmarriage so unequal; and he said no more than the truth in this, for it\nhas never entered my mind to marry that giant, or any other, let him be\never so great or enormous. My father said, too, that when he was dead,\nand I saw Pandafilando about to invade my kingdom, I was not to wait\nand attempt to defend myself, for that would be destructive to me, but\nthat I should leave the kingdom entirely open to him if I wished to\navoid the death and total destruction of my good and loyal vassals, for\nthere would be no possibility of defending myself against the giant's\ndevilish power; and that I should at once with some of my followers set\nout for Spain, where I should obtain relief in my distress on finding a\ncertain knight-errant whose fame by that time would extend over the\nwhole kingdom, and who would be called, if I remember rightly, Don\nAzote or Don Gigote.\"\n\"'Don Quixote,' he must have said, se\u00f1ora,\" observed Sancho at this,\n\"otherwise called the Knight of the Rueful Countenance.\"\n\"That is it,\" said Dorothea; \"he said, moreover, that he would be tall\nof stature and lank featured; and that on his right side under the left\nshoulder, or thereabouts, he would have a grey mole with hairs like\nbristles.\"\nOn hearing this, Don Quixote said to his squire, \"Here, Sancho my son,\nbear a hand and help me to strip, for I want to see if I am the knight\nthat sage king foretold.\"\n\"What does your worship want to strip for?\" said Dorothea.\n\"To see if I have that mole your father spoke of,\" answered Don\nQuixote.\n\"There is no occasion to strip,\" said Sancho; \"for I know your worship\nhas just such a mole on the middle of your backbone, which is the mark\nof a strong man.\"\n\"That is enough,\" said Dorothea, \"for with friends we must not look too\nclosely into trifles; and whether it be on the shoulder or on the\nbackbone matters little; it is enough if there is a mole, be it where\nit may, for it is all the same flesh; no doubt my good father hit the\ntruth in every particular, and I have made a lucky hit in commending\nmyself to Don Quixote; for he is the one my father spoke of, as the\nfeatures of his countenance correspond with those assigned to this\nknight by that wide fame he has acquired not only in Spain but in all\nLa Mancha; for I had scarcely landed at Osuna when I heard such\naccounts of his achievements, that at once my heart told me he was the\nvery one I had come in search of.\"\n\"But how did you land at Osuna, se\u00f1ora,\" asked Don Quixote, \"when it is\nnot a seaport?\"\nBut before Dorothea could reply the curate anticipated her, saying,\n\"The princess meant to say that after she had landed at Malaga the\nfirst place where she heard of your worship was Osuna.\"\n\"That is what I meant to say,\" said Dorothea.\n\"And that would be only natural,\" said the curate. \"Will your majesty\nplease proceed?\"\n\"There is no more to add,\" said Dorothea, \"save that in finding Don\nQuixote I have had such good fortune, that I already reckon and regard\nmyself queen and mistress of my entire dominions, since of his courtesy\nand magnanimity he has granted me the boon of accompanying me\nwhithersoever I may conduct him, which will be only to bring him face\nto face with Pandafilando of the Scowl, that he may slay him and\nrestore to me what has been unjustly usurped by him: for all this must\ncome to pass satisfactorily since my good father Tinacrio the Sapient\nforetold it, who likewise left it declared in writing in Chaldee or\nGreek characters (for I cannot read them), that if this predicted\nknight, after having cut the giant's throat, should be disposed to\nmarry me I was to offer myself at once without demur as his lawful\nwife, and yield him possession of my kingdom together with my person.\"",

Dorothea\ntherefore gave her hand, and promised to make him a great lord in her\nkingdom, when Heaven should be so good as to permit her to recover and\nenjoy it, for which Sancho returned thanks in words that set them all\nlaughing again.\n\"This, sirs,\" continued Dorothea, \"is my story; it only remains to tell\nyou that of all the attendants I took with me from my kingdom I have\nnone left except this well-bearded squire, for all were drowned in a\ngreat tempest we encountered when in sight of port; and he and I came\nto land on a couple of planks as if by a miracle; and indeed the whole\ncourse of my life is a miracle and a mystery as you may have observed;\nand if I have been over minute in any respect or not as precise as I\nought, let it be accounted for by what the licentiate said at the\nbeginning of my tale, that constant and excessive troubles deprive the\nsufferers of their memory.\"\n\"They shall not deprive me of mine, exalted and worthy princess,\" said\nDon Quixote, \"however great and unexampled those which I shall endure\nin your service may be; and here I confirm anew the boon I have\npromised you, and I swear to go with you to the end of the world until\nI find myself in the presence of your fierce enemy, whose haughty head\nI trust by the aid of my arm to cut off with the edge of this\u2014I will\nnot say good sword, thanks to Gines de Pasamonte who carried away\nmine\"\u2014(this he said between his teeth, and then continued), \"and when\nit has been cut off and you have been put in peaceful possession of\nyour realm it shall be left to your own decision to dispose of your\nperson as may be most pleasing to you; for so long as my memory is\noccupied, my will enslaved, and my understanding enthralled by her\u2014I\nsay no more\u2014it is impossible for me for a moment to contemplate\nmarriage, even with a Ph\u0153nix.\"\nThe last words of his master about not wanting to marry were so\ndisagreeable to Sancho that raising his voice he exclaimed with great\nirritation:\n\"By my oath, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, you are not in your right senses; for\nhow can your worship possibly object to marrying such an exalted\nprincess as this? Do you think Fortune will offer you behind every\nstone such a piece of luck as is offered you now? Is my lady Dulcinea\nfairer, perchance? Not she; nor half as fair; and I will even go so far\nas to say she does not come up to the shoe of this one here. A poor\nchance I have of getting that county I am waiting for if your worship\ngoes looking for dainties in the bottom of the sea. In the devil's\nname, marry, marry, and take this kingdom that comes to hand without\nany trouble, and when you are king make me a marquis or governor of a\nprovince, and for the rest let the devil take it all.\"\nDon Quixote, when he heard such blasphemies uttered against his lady\nDulcinea, could not endure it, and lifting his pike, without saying\nanything to Sancho or uttering a word, he gave him two such thwacks\nthat he brought him to the ground; and had it not been that Dorothea\ncried out to him to spare him he would have no doubt taken his life on\nthe spot.\n\"Do you think,\" he said to him after a pause, \"you scurvy clown, that\nyou are to be always interfering with me, and that you are to be always\noffending and I always pardoning? Don't fancy it, impious scoundrel,\nfor that beyond a doubt thou art, since thou hast set thy tongue going\nagainst the peerless Dulcinea. Know you not, lout, vagabond, beggar,\nthat were it not for the might that she infuses into my arm I should\nnot have strength enough to kill a flea? Say, scoffer with a viper's\ntongue, what think you has won this kingdom and cut off this giant's\nhead and made you a marquis (for all this I count as already\naccomplished and decided), but the might of Dulcinea, employing my arm\nas the instrument of her achievements? She fights in me and conquers in\nme, and I live and breathe in her, and owe my life and being to her. O\nwhoreson scoundrel, how ungrateful you are, you see yourself raised\nfrom the dust of the earth to be a titled lord, and the return you make\nfor so great a benefit is to speak evil of her who has conferred it\nupon you!\"",

Sancho saw him and recognised him, and the instant he did\nso he shouted to him, \"Ginesillo, you thief, give up my treasure,\nrelease my life, embarrass thyself not with my repose, quit my ass,\nleave my delight, be off, rip, get thee gone, thief, and give up what\nis not thine.\"\nThere was no necessity for so many words or objurgations, for at the\nfirst one Gines jumped down, and at a like racing speed made off and\ngot clear of them all. Sancho hastened to his Dapple, and embracing him\nhe said, \"How hast thou fared, my blessing, Dapple of my eyes, my\ncomrade?\" all the while kissing him and caressing him as if he were a\nhuman being. The ass held his peace, and let himself be kissed and\ncaressed by Sancho without answering a single word. They all came up\nand congratulated him on having found Dapple, Don Quixote especially,\nwho told him that notwithstanding this he would not cancel the order\nfor the three ass-colts, for which Sancho thanked him.",

Surely thou\ndidst find her stringing pearls, or embroidering some device in gold\nthread for this her enslaved knight.\"\n\"I did not,\" said Sancho, \"but I found her winnowing two bushels of\nwheat in the yard of her house.\"\n\"Then depend upon it,\" said Don Quixote, \"the grains of that wheat were\npearls when touched by her hands; and didst thou look, friend? was it\nwhite wheat or brown?\"\n\"It was neither, but red,\" said Sancho.\n\"Then I promise thee,\" said Don Quixote, \"that, winnowed by her hands,\nbeyond a doubt the bread it made was of the whitest; but go on; when\nthou gavest her my letter, did she kiss it? Did she place it on her\nhead? Did she perform any ceremony befitting it, or what did she do?\"\n\"When I went to give it to her,\" replied Sancho, \"she was hard at it\nswaying from side to side with a lot of wheat she had in the sieve, and\nshe said to me, 'Lay the letter, friend, on the top of that sack, for I\ncannot read it until I have done sifting all this.\"\n\"Discreet lady!\" said Don Quixote; \"that was in order to read it at her\nleisure and enjoy it; proceed, Sancho; while she was engaged in her\noccupation what converse did she hold with thee? What did she ask about\nme, and what answer didst thou give? Make haste; tell me all, and let\nnot an atom be left behind in the ink-bottle.\"\n\"She asked me nothing,\" said Sancho; \"but I told her how your worship\nwas left doing penance in her service, naked from the waist up, in\namong these mountains like a savage, sleeping on the ground, not eating\nbread off a tablecloth nor combing your beard, weeping and cursing your\nfortune.\"\n\"In saying I cursed my fortune thou saidst wrong,\" said Don Quixote;\n\"for rather do I bless it and shall bless it all the days of my life\nfor having made me worthy of aspiring to love so lofty a lady as\nDulcinea del Toboso.\"\n\"And so lofty she is,\" said Sancho, \"that she overtops me by more than\na hand's-breadth.\"\n\"What! Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"didst thou measure with her?\"\n\"I measured in this way,\" said Sancho; \"going to help her to put a sack\nof wheat on the back of an ass, we came so close together that I could\nsee she stood more than a good palm over me.\"\n\"Well!\" said Don Quixote, \"and doth she not of a truth accompany and\nadorn this greatness with a thousand million charms of mind! But one\nthing thou wilt not deny, Sancho; when thou camest close to her didst\nthou not perceive a Sab\u00e6an odour, an aromatic fragrance, a, I know not\nwhat, delicious, that I cannot find a name for; I mean a redolence, an\nexhalation, as if thou wert in the shop of some dainty glover?\"\n\"All I can say is,\" said Sancho, \"that I did perceive a little odour,\nsomething goaty; it must have been that she was all in a sweat with\nhard work.\"\n\"It could not be that,\" said Don Quixote, \"but thou must have been\nsuffering from cold in the head, or must have smelt thyself; for I know\nwell what would be the scent of that rose among thorns, that lily of\nthe field, that dissolved amber.\"\n\"Maybe so,\" replied Sancho; \"there often comes from myself that same\nodour which then seemed to me to come from her grace the lady Dulcinea;\nbut that's no wonder, for one devil is like another.\"\n\"Well then,\" continued Don Quixote, \"now she has done sifting the corn\nand sent it to the mill; what did she do when she read the letter?\"\n\"As for the letter,\" said Sancho, \"she did not read it, for she said\nshe could neither read nor write; instead of that she tore it up into\nsmall pieces, saying that she did not want to let anyone read it lest\nher secrets should become known in the village, and that what I had\ntold her by word of mouth about the love your worship bore her, and the\nextraordinary penance you were doing for her sake, was enough; and, to\nmake an end of it, she told me to tell your worship that she kissed\nyour hands, and that she had a greater desire to see you than to write\nto you; and that therefore she entreated and commanded you, on sight of\nthis present, to come out of these thickets, and to have done with\ncarrying on absurdities, and to set out at once for El Toboso, unless\nsomething else of greater importance should happen, for she had a great\ndesire to see your worship. She laughed greatly when I told her how\nyour worship was called The Knight of the Rueful Countenance; I asked\nher if that Biscayan the other day had been there; and she told me he\nhad, and that he was an honest fellow; I asked her too about the galley\nslaves, but she said she had not seen any as yet.\"\n\"So far all goes well,\" said Don Quixote; \"but tell me what jewel was\nit that she gave thee on taking thy leave, in return for thy tidings of\nme? For it is a usual and ancient custom with knights and ladies errant\nto give the squires, damsels, or dwarfs who bring tidings of their\nladies to the knights, or of their knights to the ladies, some rich\njewel as a guerdon for good news, and acknowledgment of the message.\"\n\"That is very likely,\" said Sancho, \"and a good custom it was, to my\nmind; but that must have been in days gone by, for now it would seem to\nbe the custom only to give a piece of bread and cheese; because that\nwas what my lady Dulcinea gave me over the top of the yard-wall when I\ntook leave of her; and more by token it was sheep's-milk cheese.\"\n\"She is generous in the extreme,\" said Don Quixote, \"and if she did not\ngive thee a jewel of gold, no doubt it must have been because she had\nnot one to hand there to give thee; but sleeves are good after Easter;\nI shall see her and all shall be made right. But knowest thou what\namazes me, Sancho? It seems to me thou must have gone and come through\nthe air, for thou hast taken but little more than three days to go to\nEl Toboso and return, though it is more than thirty leagues from here\nto there. From which I am inclined to think that the sage magician who\nis my friend, and watches over my interests (for of necessity there is\nand must be one, or else I should not be a right knight-errant), that\nthis same, I say, must have helped thee to travel without thy\nknowledge; for some of these sages will catch up a knight-errant\nsleeping in his bed, and without his knowing how or in what way it\nhappened, he wakes up the next day more than a thousand leagues away\nfrom the place where he went to sleep. And if it were not for this,\nknights-errant would not be able to give aid to one another in peril,\nas they do at every turn. For a knight, maybe, is fighting in the\nmountains of Armenia with some dragon, or fierce serpent, or another\nknight, and gets the worst of the battle, and is at the point of death;\nbut when he least looks for it, there appears over against him on a\ncloud, or chariot of fire, another knight, a friend of his, who just\nbefore had been in England, and who takes his part, and delivers him\nfrom death; and at night he finds himself in his own quarters supping\nvery much to his satisfaction; and yet from one place to the other will\nhave been two or three thousand leagues. And all this is done by the\ncraft and skill of the sage enchanters who take care of those valiant\nknights; so that, friend Sancho, I find no difficulty in believing that\nthou mayest have gone from this place to El Toboso and returned in such\na short time, since, as I have said, some friendly sage must have\ncarried thee through the air without thee perceiving it.\"\n\"That must have been it,\" said Sancho, \"for indeed Rocinante went like\na gipsy's ass with quicksilver in his ears.\"\n\"Quicksilver!\" said Don Quixote, \"aye and what is more, a legion of\ndevils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being\nweary, exactly as the whim seizes them. But putting this aside, what\nthinkest thou I ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her?\nFor though I feel that I am bound to obey her mandate, I feel too that\nI am debarred by the boon I have accorded to the princess that\naccompanies us, and the law of chivalry compels me to have regard for\nmy word in preference to my inclination; on the one hand the desire to\nsee my lady pursues and harasses me, on the other my solemn promise and\nthe glory I shall win in this enterprise urge and call me; but what I\nthink I shall do is to travel with all speed and reach quickly the\nplace where this giant is, and on my arrival I shall cut off his head,\nand establish the princess peacefully in her realm, and forthwith I\nshall return to behold the light that lightens my senses, to whom I\nshall make such excuses that she will be led to approve of my delay,\nfor she will see that it entirely tends to increase her glory and fame;\nfor all that I have won, am winning, or shall win by arms in this life,\ncomes to me of the favour she extends to me, and because I am hers.\"\n\"Ah! what a sad state your worship's brains are in!\" said Sancho. \"Tell\nme, se\u00f1or, do you mean to travel all that way for nothing, and to let\nslip and lose so rich and great a match as this where they give as a\nportion a kingdom that in sober truth I have heard say is more than\ntwenty thousand leagues round about, and abounds with all things\nnecessary to support human life, and is bigger than Portugal and\nCastile put together? Peace, for the love of God! Blush for what you\nhave said, and take my advice, and forgive me, and marry at once in the\nfirst village where there is a curate; if not, here is our licentiate\nwho will do the business beautifully; remember, I am old enough to give\nadvice, and this I am giving comes pat to the purpose; for a sparrow in\nthe hand is better than a vulture on the wing, and he who has the good\nto his hand and chooses the bad, that the good he complains of may not\ncome to him.\"\n\"Look here, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote. \"If thou art advising me to\nmarry, in order that immediately on slaying the giant I may become\nking, and be able to confer favours on thee, and give thee what I have\npromised, let me tell thee I shall be able very easily to satisfy thy\ndesires without marrying; for before going into battle I will make it a\nstipulation that, if I come out of it victorious, even I do not marry,\nthey shall give me a portion of the kingdom, that I may bestow it upon\nwhomsoever I choose, and when they give it to me upon whom wouldst thou\nhave me bestow it but upon thee?\"\n\"That is plain speaking,\" said Sancho; \"but let your worship take care\nto choose it on the seacoast, so that if I don't like the life, I may\nbe able to ship off my black vassals and deal with them as I have said;\ndon't mind going to see my lady Dulcinea now, but go and kill this\ngiant and let us finish off this business; for by God it strikes me it\nwill be one of great honour and great profit.\"\n\"I hold thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote, \"and I\nwill take thy advice as to accompanying the princess before going to\nsee Dulcinea; but I counsel thee not to say anything to anyone, or to\nthose who are with us, about what we have considered and discussed, for\nas Dulcinea is so decorous that she does not wish her thoughts to be\nknown it is not right that I or anyone for me should disclose them.\"\n\"Well then, if that be so,\" said Sancho, \"how is it that your worship\nmakes all those you overcome by your arm go to present themselves\nbefore my lady Dulcinea, this being the same thing as signing your name\nto it that you love her and are her lover? And as those who go must",

            "text": "moment ran to Don Quixote and clasping him round the legs, began to\nweep freely, saying, \"O, se\u00f1or, do you not know me? Look at me well; I\nam that lad Andres that your worship released from the oak-tree where I\nwas tied.\"\nDon Quixote recognised him, and taking his hand he turned to those\npresent and said: \"That your worships may see how important it is to\nhave knights-errant to redress the wrongs and injuries done by\ntyrannical and wicked men in this world, I may tell you that some days\nago passing through a wood, I heard cries and piteous complaints as of\na person in pain and distress; I immediately hastened, impelled by my\nbounden duty, to the quarter whence the plaintive accents seemed to me\nto proceed, and I found tied to an oak this lad who now stands before\nyou, which in my heart I rejoice at, for his testimony will not permit\nme to depart from the truth in any particular. He was, I say, tied to\nan oak, naked from the waist up, and a clown, whom I afterwards found\nto be his master, was scarifying him by lashes with the reins of his\nmare. As soon as I saw him I asked the reason of so cruel a\nflagellation. The boor replied that he was flogging him because he was\nhis servant and because of carelessness that proceeded rather from\ndishonesty than stupidity; on which this boy said, 'Se\u00f1or, he flogs me\nonly because I ask for my wages.' The master made I know not what\nspeeches and explanations, which, though I listened to them, I did not\naccept. In short, I compelled the clown to unbind him, and to swear he\nwould take him with him, and pay him real by real, and perfumed into\nthe bargain. Is not all this true, Andres my son? Didst thou not mark\nwith what authority I commanded him, and with what humility he promised\nto do all I enjoined, specified, and required of him? Answer without\nhesitation; tell these gentlemen what took place, that they may see\nthat it is as great an advantage as I say to have knights-errant\nabroad.\"\n\"All that your worship has said is quite true,\" answered the lad; \"but\nthe end of the business turned out just the opposite of what your\nworship supposes.\"\n\"How! the opposite?\" said Don Quixote; \"did not the clown pay thee\nthen?\"\n\"Not only did he not pay me,\" replied the lad, \"but as soon as your\nworship had passed out of the wood and we were alone, he tied me up\nagain to the same oak and gave me a fresh flogging, that left me like a\nflayed Saint Bartholomew; and every stroke he gave me he followed up\nwith some jest or gibe about having made a fool of your worship, and\nbut for the pain I was suffering I should have laughed at the things he\nsaid. In short he left me in such a condition that I have been until\nnow in a hospital getting cured of the injuries which that rascally\nclown inflicted on me then; for all which your worship is to blame; for\nif you had gone your own way and not come where there was no call for\nyou, nor meddled in other people's affairs, my master would have been\ncontent with giving me one or two dozen lashes, and would have then\nloosed me and paid me what he owed me; but when your worship abused him\nso out of measure, and gave him so many hard words, his anger was\nkindled; and as he could not revenge himself on you, as soon as he saw\nyou had left him the storm burst upon me in such a way, that I feel as\nif I should never be a man again.\"\n\"The mischief,\" said Don Quixote, \"lay in my going away; for I should\nnot have gone until I had seen thee paid; because I ought to have known\nwell by long experience that there is no clown who will keep his word\nif he finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest,\nAndres, that I swore if he did not pay thee I would go and seek him,\nand find him though he were to hide himself in the whale's belly.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Andres; \"but it was of no use.\"\n\"Thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not,\" said Don Quixote; and\nso saying, he got up hastily and bade Sancho bridle Rocinante, who was\nbrowsing while they were eating. Dorothea asked him what he meant to\ndo. He replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise\nhim for such iniquitous conduct, and see Andres paid to the last\nmaravedi, despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. To\nwhich she replied that he must remember that in accordance with his\npromise he could not engage in any enterprise until he had concluded\nhers; and that as he knew this better than anyone, he should restrain\nhis ardour until his return from her kingdom.\n\"That is true,\" said Don Quixote, \"and Andres must have patience until\nmy return as you say, se\u00f1ora; but I once more swear and promise not to\nstop until I have seen him avenged and paid.\"\n\"I have no faith in those oaths,\" said Andres; \"I would rather have now\nsomething to help me to get to Seville than all the revenges in the\nworld; if you have here anything to eat that I can take with me, give\nit me, and God be with your worship and all knights-errant; and may\ntheir errands turn out as well for themselves as they have for me.\"\nSancho took out from his store a piece of bread and another of cheese,\nand giving them to the lad he said, \"Here, take this, brother Andres,\nfor we have all of us a share in your misfortune.\"\n\"Why, what share have you got?\"\n\"This share of bread and cheese I am giving you,\" answered Sancho; \"and\nGod knows whether I shall feel the want of it myself or not; for I\nwould have you know, friend, that we squires to knights-errant have to\nbear a great deal of hunger and hard fortune, and even other things\nmore easily felt than told.\"\nAndres seized his bread and cheese, and seeing that nobody gave him\nanything more, bent his head, and took hold of the road, as the saying\nis. However, before leaving he said, \"For the love of God, sir\nknight-errant, if you ever meet me again, though you may see them\ncutting me to pieces, give me no aid or succour, but leave me to my\nmisfortune, which will not be so great but that a greater will come to\nme by being helped by your worship, on whom and all the knights-errant\nthat have ever been born God send his curse.\"\nDon Quixote was getting up to chastise him, but he took to his heels at\nsuch a pace that no one attempted to follow him; and mightily\nchapfallen was Don Quixote at Andres' story, and the others had to take\ngreat care to restrain their laughter so as not to put him entirely out\nof countenance.",

The landlady, the\nlandlord, their daughter, and Maritornes, when they saw Don Quixote and\nSancho coming, went out to welcome them with signs of hearty\nsatisfaction, which Don Quixote received with dignity and gravity, and\nbade them make up a better bed for him than the last time: to which the\nlandlady replied that if he paid better than he did the last time she\nwould give him one fit for a prince. Don Quixote said he would, so they\nmade up a tolerable one for him in the same garret as before; and he\nlay down at once, being sorely shaken and in want of sleep.\nNo sooner was the door shut upon him than the landlady made at the\nbarber, and seizing him by the beard, said:\n\"By my faith you are not going to make a beard of my tail any longer;\nyou must give me back my tail, for it is a shame the way that thing of\nmy husband's goes tossing about on the floor; I mean the comb that I\nused to stick in my good tail.\"\nBut for all she tugged at it the barber would not give it up until the\nlicentiate told him to let her have it, as there was now no further\noccasion for that stratagem, because he might declare himself and\nappear in his own character, and tell Don Quixote that he had fled to\nthis inn when those thieves the galley slaves robbed him; and should he\nask for the princess's squire, they could tell him that she had sent\nhim on before her to give notice to the people of her kingdom that she\nwas coming, and bringing with her the deliverer of them all. On this\nthe barber cheerfully restored the tail to the landlady, and at the\nsame time they returned all the accessories they had borrowed to effect\nDon Quixote's deliverance. All the people of the inn were struck with\nastonishment at the beauty of Dorothea, and even at the comely figure\nof the shepherd Cardenio. The curate made them get ready such fare as\nthere was in the inn, and the landlord, in hope of better payment,\nserved them up a tolerably good dinner. All this time Don Quixote was\nasleep, and they thought it best not to waken him, as sleeping would\nnow do him more good than eating.",

But on the curate observing\nthat it was the books of chivalry which Don Quixote had read that had\nturned his brain, the landlord said:\n\"I cannot understand how that can be, for in truth to my mind there is\nno better reading in the world, and I have here two or three of them,\nwith other writings that are the very life, not only of myself but of\nplenty more; for when it is harvest-time, the reapers flock here on\nholidays, and there is always one among them who can read and who takes\nup one of these books, and we gather round him, thirty or more of us,\nand stay listening to him with a delight that makes our grey hairs grow\nyoung again. At least I can say for myself that when I hear of what\nfurious and terrible blows the knights deliver, I am seized with the\nlonging to do the same, and I would like to be hearing about them night\nand day.\"\n\"And I just as much,\" said the landlady, \"because I never have a quiet\nmoment in my house except when you are listening to someone reading;\nfor then you are so taken up that for the time being you forget to\nscold.\"\n\"That is true,\" said Maritornes; \"and, faith, I relish hearing these\nthings greatly too, for they are very pretty; especially when they\ndescribe some lady or another in the arms of her knight under the\norange trees, and the duenna who is keeping watch for them half dead\nwith envy and fright; all this I say is as good as honey.\"\n\"And you, what do you think, young lady?\" said the curate turning to\nthe landlord's daughter.\n\"I don't know indeed, se\u00f1or,\" said she; \"I listen too, and to tell the\ntruth, though I do not understand it, I like hearing it; but it is not\nthe blows that my father likes that I like, but the laments the knights\nutter when they are separated from their ladies; and indeed they\nsometimes make me weep with the pity I feel for them.\"\n\"Then you would console them if it was for you they wept, young lady?\"\nsaid Dorothea.\n\"I don't know what I should do,\" said the girl; \"I only know that there\nare some of those ladies so cruel that they call their knights tigers\nand lions and a thousand other foul names: and Jesus! I don't know what\nsort of folk they can be, so unfeeling and heartless, that rather than\nbestow a glance upon a worthy man they leave him to die or go mad. I\ndon't know what is the good of such prudery; if it is for honour's\nsake, why not marry them? That's all they want.\"\n\"Hush, child,\" said the landlady; \"it seems to me thou knowest a great\ndeal about these things, and it is not fit for girls to know or talk so\nmuch.\"\n\"As the gentleman asked me, I could not help answering him,\" said the\ngirl.\n\"Well then,\" said the curate, \"bring me these books, se\u00f1or landlord,\nfor I should like to see them.\"\n\"With all my heart,\" said he, and going into his own room he brought\nout an old valise secured with a little chain, on opening which the\ncurate found in it three large books and some manuscripts written in a\nvery good hand. The first that he opened he found to be \"Don Cirongilio\nof Thrace,\" and the second \"Don Felixmarte of Hircania,\" and the other\nthe \"History of the Great Captain Gonzalo Hernandez de Cordova, with\nthe Life of Diego Garc\u00eda de Paredes.\"\nWhen the curate read the two first titles he looked over at the barber\nand said, \"We want my friend's housekeeper and niece here now.\"\n\"Nay,\" said the barber, \"I can do just as well to carry them to the\nyard or to the hearth, and there is a very good fire there.\"\n\"What! your worship would burn my books!\" said the landlord.\n\"Only these two,\" said the curate, \"Don Cirongilio, and Felixmarte.\"\n\"Are my books, then, heretics or phlegmatics that you want to burn\nthem?\" said the landlord.\n\"Schismatics you mean, friend,\" said the barber, \"not phlegmatics.\"\n\"That's it,\" said the landlord; \"but if you want to burn any, let it be\nthat about the Great Captain and that Diego Garc\u00eda; for I would rather\nhave a child of mine burnt than either of the others.\"\n\"Brother,\" said the curate, \"those two books are made up of lies, and\nare full of folly and nonsense; but this of the Great Captain is a true\nhistory, and contains the deeds of Gonzalo Hernandez of Cordova, who by\nhis many and great achievements earned the title all over the world of\nthe Great Captain, a famous and illustrious name, and deserved by him\nalone; and this Diego Garc\u00eda de Paredes was a distinguished knight of\nthe city of Trujillo in Estremadura, a most gallant soldier, and of\nsuch bodily strength that with one finger he stopped a mill-wheel in\nfull motion; and posted with a two-handed sword at the foot of a bridge\nhe kept the whole of an immense army from passing over it, and achieved\nsuch other exploits that if, instead of his relating them himself with\nthe modesty of a knight and of one writing his own history, some free\nand unbiased writer had recorded them, they would have thrown into the\nshade all the deeds of the Hectors, Achilleses, and Rolands.\"\nc32b.jpg (395K)\nFull Size\n\"Tell that to my father,\" said the landlord. \"There's a thing to be\nastonished at! Stopping a mill-wheel! By God your worship should read\nwhat I have read of Felixmarte of Hircania, how with one single\nbackstroke he cleft five giants asunder through the middle as if they\nhad been made of bean-pods like the little friars the children make;\nand another time he attacked a very great and powerful army, in which\nthere were more than a million six hundred thousand soldiers, all armed\nfrom head to foot, and he routed them all as if they had been flocks of\nsheep.\"\nc32c.jpg (341K)\nFull Size\n\"And then, what do you say to the good Cirongilio of Thrace, that was\nso stout and bold; as may be seen in the book, where it is related that\nas he was sailing along a river there came up out of the midst of the\nwater against him a fiery serpent, and he, as soon as he saw it, flung\nhimself upon it and got astride of its scaly shoulders, and squeezed\nits throat with both hands with such force that the serpent, finding he\nwas throttling it, had nothing for it but to let itself sink to the\nbottom of the river, carrying with it the knight who would not let go\nhis hold; and when they got down there he found himself among palaces\nand gardens so pretty that it was a wonder to see; and then the serpent\nchanged itself into an old ancient man, who told him such things as\nwere never heard. Hold your peace, se\u00f1or; for if you were to hear this\nyou would go mad with delight. A couple of figs for your Great Captain\nand your Diego Garc\u00eda!\"\nHearing this Dorothea said in a whisper to Cardenio, \"Our landlord is\nalmost fit to play a second part to Don Quixote.\"\n\"I think so,\" said Cardenio, \"for, as he shows, he accepts it as a\ncertainty that everything those books relate took place exactly as it\nis written down; and the barefooted friars themselves would not\npersuade him to the contrary.\"\n\"But consider, brother,\" said the curate once more, \"there never was\nany Felixmarte of Hircania in the world, nor any Cirongilio of Thrace,\nor any of the other knights of the same sort, that the books of\nchivalry talk of; the whole thing is the fabrication and invention of\nidle wits, devised by them for the purpose you describe of beguiling\nthe time, as your reapers do when they read; for I swear to you in all\nseriousness there never were any such knights in the world, and no such\nexploits or nonsense ever happened anywhere.\"\n\"Try that bone on another dog,\" said the landlord; \"as if I did not\nknow how many make five, and where my shoe pinches me; don't think to\nfeed me with pap, for by God I am no fool. It is a good joke for your\nworship to try and persuade me that everything these good books say is\nnonsense and lies, and they printed by the license of the Lords of the\nRoyal Council, as if they were people who would allow such a lot of\nlies to be printed all together, and so many battles and enchantments\nthat they take away one's senses.\"\n\"I have told you, friend,\" said the curate, \"that this is done to\ndivert our idle thoughts; and as in well-ordered states games of chess,\nfives, and billiards are allowed for the diversion of those who do not\ncare, or are not obliged, or are unable to work, so books of this kind\nare allowed to be printed, on the supposition that, what indeed is the\ntruth, there can be nobody so ignorant as to take any of them for true\nstories; and if it were permitted me now, and the present company\ndesired it, I could say something about the qualities books of chivalry\nshould possess to be good ones, that would be to the advantage and even\nto the taste of some; but I hope the time will come when I can\ncommunicate my ideas to someone who may be able to mend matters; and in\nthe meantime, se\u00f1or landlord, believe what I have said, and take your\nbooks, and make up your mind about their truth or falsehood, and much\ngood may they do you; and God grant you may not fall lame of the same\nfoot your guest Don Quixote halts on.\"\n\"No fear of that,\" returned the landlord; \"I shall not be so mad as to\nmake a knight-errant of myself; for I see well enough that things are\nnot now as they used to be in those days, when they say those famous\nknights roamed about the world.\"\nSancho had made his appearance in the middle of this conversation, and\nhe was very much troubled and cast down by what he heard said about\nknights-errant being now no longer in vogue, and all books of chivalry\nbeing folly and lies; and he resolved in his heart to wait and see what\ncame of this journey of his master's, and if it did not turn out as\nhappily as his master expected, he determined to leave him and go back\nto his wife and children and his ordinary labour.",

            "text": "city, Anselmo addressed the following words to Lothario.\n\"Thou mayest suppose, Lothario my friend, that I am unable to give\nsufficient thanks for the favours God has rendered me in making me the\nson of such parents as mine were, and bestowing upon me with no niggard\nhand what are called the gifts of nature as well as those of fortune,\nand above all for what he has done in giving me thee for a friend and\nCamilla for a wife\u2014two treasures that I value, if not as highly as I\nought, at least as highly as I am able. And yet, with all these good\nthings, which are commonly all that men need to enable them to live\nhappily, I am the most discontented and dissatisfied man in the whole\nworld; for, I know not how long since, I have been harassed and\noppressed by a desire so strange and so unusual, that I wonder at\nmyself and blame and chide myself when I am alone, and strive to stifle\nit and hide it from my own thoughts, and with no better success than if\nI were endeavouring deliberately to publish it to all the world; and\nas, in short, it must come out, I would confide it to thy safe keeping,\nfeeling sure that by this means, and by thy readiness as a true friend\nto afford me relief, I shall soon find myself freed from the distress\nit causes me, and that thy care will give me happiness in the same\ndegree as my own folly has caused me misery.\"\nThe words of Anselmo struck Lothario with astonishment, unable as he\nwas to conjecture the purport of such a lengthy preamble; and though he\nstrove to imagine what desire it could be that so troubled his friend,\nhis conjectures were all far from the truth, and to relieve the anxiety\nwhich this perplexity was causing him, he told him he was doing a\nflagrant injustice to their great friendship in seeking circuitous\nmethods of confiding to him his most hidden thoughts, for he well knew\nhe might reckon upon his counsel in diverting them, or his help in\ncarrying them into effect.\n\"That is the truth,\" replied Anselmo, \"and relying upon that I will\ntell thee, friend Lothario, that the desire which harasses me is that\nof knowing whether my wife Camilla is as good and as perfect as I think\nher to be; and I cannot satisfy myself of the truth on this point\nexcept by testing her in such a way that the trial may prove the purity\nof her virtue as the fire proves that of gold; because I am persuaded,\nmy friend, that a woman is virtuous only in proportion as she is or is\nnot tempted; and that she alone is strong who does not yield to the\npromises, gifts, tears, and importunities of earnest lovers; for what\nthanks does a woman deserve for being good if no one urges her to be\nbad, and what wonder is it that she is reserved and circumspect to whom\nno opportunity is given of going wrong and who knows she has a husband\nthat will take her life the first time he detects her in an\nimpropriety? I do not therefore hold her who is virtuous through fear\nor want of opportunity in the same estimation as her who comes out of\ntemptation and trial with a crown of victory; and so, for these reasons\nand many others that I could give thee to justify and support the\nopinion I hold, I am desirous that my wife Camilla should pass this\ncrisis, and be refined and tested by the fire of finding herself wooed\nand by one worthy to set his affections upon her; and if she comes out,\nas I know she will, victorious from this struggle, I shall look upon my\ngood fortune as unequalled, I shall be able to say that the cup of my\ndesire is full, and that the virtuous woman of whom the sage says 'Who\nshall find her?' has fallen to my lot. And if the result be the\ncontrary of what I expect, in the satisfaction of knowing that I have\nbeen right in my opinion, I shall bear without complaint the pain which\nmy so dearly bought experience will naturally cause me. And, as nothing\nof all thou wilt urge in opposition to my wish will avail to keep me\nfrom carrying it into effect, it is my desire, friend Lothario, that\nthou shouldst consent to become the instrument for effecting this\npurpose that I am bent upon, for I will afford thee opportunities to\nthat end, and nothing shall be wanting that I may think necessary for\nthe pursuit of a virtuous, honourable, modest and high-minded woman.\nAnd among other reasons, I am induced to entrust this arduous task to\nthee by the consideration that if Camilla be conquered by thee the\nconquest will not be pushed to extremes, but only far enough to account\nthat accomplished which from a sense of honour will be left undone;\nthus I shall not be wronged in anything more than intention, and my\nwrong will remain buried in the integrity of thy silence, which I know\nwell will be as lasting as that of death in what concerns me. If,\ntherefore, thou wouldst have me enjoy what can be called life, thou\nwilt at once engage in this love struggle, not lukewarmly nor\nslothfully, but with the energy and zeal that my desire demands, and\nwith the loyalty our friendship assures me of.\"",

            "explanation": "Lothario argues against Anselmo's request.",
            "text": "Such were the words Anselmo addressed to Lothario, who listened to them\nwith such attention that, except to say what has been already\nmentioned, he did not open his lips until the other had finished. Then\nperceiving that he had no more to say, after regarding him for a while,\nas one would regard something never before seen that excited wonder and\namazement, he said to him, \"I cannot persuade myself, Anselmo my\nfriend, that what thou hast said to me is not in jest; if I thought\nthat thou wert speaking seriously I would not have allowed thee to go\nso far; so as to put a stop to thy long harangue by not listening to\nthee I verily suspect that either thou dost not know me, or I do not\nknow thee; but no, I know well thou art Anselmo, and thou knowest that\nI am Lothario; the misfortune is, it seems to me, that thou art not the\nAnselmo thou wert, and must have thought that I am not the Lothario I\nshould be; for the things that thou hast said to me are not those of\nthat Anselmo who was my friend, nor are those that thou demandest of me\nwhat should be asked of the Lothario thou knowest. True friends will\nprove their friends and make use of them, as a poet has said, _usque ad\naras;_ whereby he meant that they will not make use of their friendship\nin things that are contrary to God's will. If this, then, was a\nheathen's feeling about friendship, how much more should it be a\nChristian's, who knows that the divine must not be forfeited for the\nsake of any human friendship? And if a friend should go so far as to\nput aside his duty to Heaven to fulfil his duty to his friend, it\nshould not be in matters that are trifling or of little moment, but in\nsuch as affect the friend's life and honour. Now tell me, Anselmo, in\nwhich of these two art thou imperilled, that I should hazard myself to\ngratify thee, and do a thing so detestable as that thou seekest of me?\nNeither forsooth; on the contrary, thou dost ask of me, so far as I\nunderstand, to strive and labour to rob thee of honour and life, and to\nrob myself of them at the same time; for if I take away thy honour it\nis plain I take away thy life, as a man without honour is worse than\ndead; and being the instrument, as thou wilt have it so, of so much\nwrong to thee, shall not I, too, be left without honour, and\nconsequently without life? Listen to me, Anselmo my friend, and be not\nimpatient to answer me until I have said what occurs to me touching the\nobject of thy desire, for there will be time enough left for thee to\nreply and for me to hear.\"\n\"Be it so,\" said Anselmo, \"say what thou wilt.\"\nLothario then went on to say, \"It seems to me, Anselmo, that thine is\njust now the temper of mind which is always that of the Moors, who can\nnever be brought to see the error of their creed by quotations from the\nHoly Scriptures, or by reasons which depend upon the examination of the\nunderstanding or are founded upon the articles of faith, but must have\nexamples that are palpable, easy, intelligible, capable of proof, not\nadmitting of doubt, with mathematical demonstrations that cannot be\ndenied, like, '_If equals be taken from equals, the remainders are\nequal:_' and if they do not understand this in words, and indeed they\ndo not, it has to be shown to them with the hands, and put before their\neyes, and even with all this no one succeeds in convincing them of the\ntruth of our holy religion. This same mode of proceeding I shall have\nto adopt with thee, for the desire which has sprung up in thee is so\nabsurd and remote from everything that has a semblance of reason, that\nI feel it would be a waste of time to employ it in reasoning with thy\nsimplicity, for at present I will call it by no other name; and I am\neven tempted to leave thee in thy folly as a punishment for thy\npernicious desire; but the friendship I bear thee, which will not allow\nme to desert thee in such manifest danger of destruction, keeps me from\ndealing so harshly by thee. And that thou mayest clearly see this, say,\nAnselmo, hast thou not told me that I must force my suit upon a modest\nwoman, decoy one that is virtuous, make overtures to one that is\npure-minded, pay court to one that is prudent? Yes, thou hast told me\nso. Then, if thou knowest that thou hast a wife, modest, virtuous,\npure-minded and prudent, what is it that thou seekest? And if thou\nbelievest that she will come forth victorious from all my attacks\u2014as\ndoubtless she would\u2014what higher titles than those she possesses now\ndost thou think thou canst bestow upon her then, or in what will she be\nbetter then than she is now? Either thou dost not hold her to be what\nthou sayest, or thou knowest not what thou dost demand. If thou dost\nnot hold her to be what thou sayest, why dost thou seek to prove her\ninstead of treating her as guilty in the way that may seem best to\nthee? but if she be as virtuous as thou believest, it is an\nuncalled-for proceeding to make trial of truth itself, for, after\ntrial, it will but be in the same estimation as before. Thus, then, it\nis conclusive that to attempt things from which harm rather than\nadvantage may come to us is the part of unreasoning and reckless minds,\nmore especially when they are things which we are not forced or\ncompelled to attempt, and which show from afar that it is plainly\nmadness to attempt them.\n\"Difficulties are attempted either for the sake of God or for the sake\nof the world, or for both; those undertaken for God's sake are those\nwhich the saints undertake when they attempt to live the lives of\nangels in human bodies; those undertaken for the sake of the world are\nthose of the men who traverse such a vast expanse of water, such a\nvariety of climates, so many strange countries, to acquire what are\ncalled the blessings of fortune; and those undertaken for the sake of\nGod and the world together are those of brave soldiers, who no sooner\ndo they see in the enemy's wall a breach as wide as a cannon ball could\nmake, than, casting aside all fear, without hesitating, or heeding the\nmanifest peril that threatens them, borne onward by the desire of\ndefending their faith, their country, and their king, they fling\nthemselves dauntlessly into the midst of the thousand opposing deaths\nthat await them. Such are the things that men are wont to attempt, and\nthere is honour, glory, gain, in attempting them, however full of\ndifficulty and peril they may be; but that which thou sayest it is thy\nwish to attempt and carry out will not win thee the glory of God nor\nthe blessings of fortune nor fame among men; for even if the issue be\nas thou wouldst have it, thou wilt be no happier, richer, or more\nhonoured than thou art this moment; and if it be otherwise thou wilt be\nreduced to misery greater than can be imagined, for then it will avail\nthee nothing to reflect that no one is aware of the misfortune that has\nbefallen thee; it will suffice to torture and crush thee that thou\nknowest it thyself. And in confirmation of the truth of what I say, let\nme repeat to thee a stanza made by the famous poet Luigi Tansillo at\nthe end of the first part of his 'Tears of Saint Peter,' which says\nthus:\nThe anguish and the shame but greater grew\nIn Peter's heart as morning slowly came;\nNo eye was there to see him, well he knew,\nYet he himself was to himself a shame;\nExposed to all men's gaze, or screened from view,\nA noble heart will feel the pang the same;\nA prey to shame the sinning soul will be,\nThough none but heaven and earth its shame can see.\nThus by keeping it secret thou wilt not escape thy sorrow, but rather\nthou wilt shed tears unceasingly, if not tears of the eyes, tears of\nblood from the heart, like those shed by that simple doctor our poet\ntells us of, that tried the test of the cup, which the wise Rinaldo,\nbetter advised, refused to do; for though this may be a poetic fiction\nit contains a moral lesson worthy of attention and study and imitation.\nMoreover by what I am about to say to thee thou wilt be led to see the\ngreat error thou wouldst commit.\n\"Tell me, Anselmo, if Heaven or good fortune had made thee master and\nlawful owner of a diamond of the finest quality, with the excellence\nand purity of which all the lapidaries that had seen it had been\nsatisfied, saying with one voice and common consent that in purity,\nquality, and fineness, it was all that a stone of the kind could\npossibly be, thou thyself too being of the same belief, as knowing\nnothing to the contrary, would it be reasonable in thee to desire to\ntake that diamond and place it between an anvil and a hammer, and by\nmere force of blows and strength of arm try if it were as hard and as\nfine as they said? And if thou didst, and if the stone should resist so\nsilly a test, that would add nothing to its value or reputation; and if\nit were broken, as it might be, would not all be lost? Undoubtedly it\nwould, leaving its owner to be rated as a fool in the opinion of all.\nConsider, then, Anselmo my friend, that Camilla is a diamond of the\nfinest quality as well in thy estimation as in that of others, and that\nit is contrary to reason to expose her to the risk of being broken; for\nif she remains intact she cannot rise to a higher value than she now\npossesses; and if she give way and be unable to resist, bethink thee\nnow how thou wilt be deprived of her, and with what good reason thou\nwilt complain of thyself for having been the cause of her ruin and\nthine own. Remember there is no jewel in the world so precious as a\nchaste and virtuous woman, and that the whole honour of women consists\nin reputation; and since thy wife's is of that high excellence that\nthou knowest, wherefore shouldst thou seek to call that truth in\nquestion? Remember, my friend, that woman is an imperfect animal, and\nthat impediments are not to be placed in her way to make her trip and\nfall, but that they should be removed, and her path left clear of all\nobstacles, so that without hindrance she may run her course freely to\nattain the desired perfection, which consists in being virtuous.\nNaturalists tell us that the ermine is a little animal which has a fur\nof purest white, and that when the hunters wish to take it, they make\nuse of this artifice. Having ascertained the places which it frequents\nand passes, they stop the way to them with mud, and then rousing it,\ndrive it towards the spot, and as soon as the ermine comes to the mud\nit halts, and allows itself to be taken captive rather than pass\nthrough the mire, and spoil and sully its whiteness, which it values\nmore than life and liberty. The virtuous and chaste woman is an ermine,\nand whiter and purer than snow is the virtue of modesty; and he who\nwishes her not to lose it, but to keep and preserve it, must adopt a\ncourse different from that employed with the ermine; he must not put\nbefore her the mire of the gifts and attentions of persevering lovers,\nbecause perhaps\u2014and even without a perhaps\u2014she may not have sufficient\nvirtue and natural strength in herself to pass through and tread under\nfoot these impediments; they must be removed, and the brightness of\nvirtue and the beauty of a fair fame must be put before her. A virtuous\nwoman, too, is like a mirror, of clear shining crystal, liable to be\ntarnished and dimmed by every breath that touches it. She must be\ntreated as relics are; adored, not touched. She must be protected and\nprized as one protects and prizes a fair garden full of roses and\nflowers, the owner of which allows no one to trespass or pluck a\nblossom; enough for others that from afar and through the iron grating\nthey may enjoy its fragrance and its beauty. Finally let me repeat to\nthee some verses that come to my mind; I heard them in a modern comedy,\nand it seems to me they bear upon the point we are discussing. A\nprudent old man was giving advice to another, the father of a young\ngirl, to lock her up, watch over her and keep her in seclusion, and\namong other arguments he used these:\nWoman is a thing of glass;\nBut her brittleness 'tis best\nNot too curiously to test:\nWho knows what may come to pass?\nBreaking is an easy matter,\nAnd it's folly to expose\nWhat you cannot mend to blows;\nWhat you can't make whole to shatter.\nThis, then, all may hold as true,\nAnd the reason's plain to see;\nFor if Dana\u00ebs there be,\nThere are golden showers too.\n\"All that I have said to thee so far, Anselmo, has had reference to\nwhat concerns thee; now it is right that I should say something of what\nregards myself; and if I be prolix, pardon me, for the labyrinth into\nwhich thou hast entered and from which thou wouldst have me extricate\nthee makes it necessary.\n\"Thou dost reckon me thy friend, and thou wouldst rob me of honour, a\nthing wholly inconsistent with friendship; and not only dost thou aim\nat this, but thou wouldst have me rob thee of it also. That thou\nwouldst rob me of it is clear, for when Camilla sees that I pay court\nto her as thou requirest, she will certainly regard me as a man without\nhonour or right feeling, since I attempt and do a thing so much opposed\nto what I owe to my own position and thy friendship. That thou wouldst\nhave me rob thee of it is beyond a doubt, for Camilla, seeing that I\npress my suit upon her, will suppose that I have perceived in her\nsomething light that has encouraged me to make known to her my base\ndesire; and if she holds herself dishonoured, her dishonour touches\nthee as belonging to her; and hence arises what so commonly takes\nplace, that the husband of the adulterous woman, though he may not be\naware of or have given any cause for his wife's failure in her duty, or\n(being careless or negligent) have had it in his power to prevent his\ndishonour, nevertheless is stigmatised by a vile and reproachful name,\nand in a manner regarded with eyes of contempt instead of pity by all\nwho know of his wife's guilt, though they see that he is unfortunate\nnot by his own fault, but by the lust of a vicious consort. But I will\ntell thee why with good reason dishonour attaches to the husband of the\nunchaste wife, though he know not that she is so, nor be to blame, nor\nhave done anything, or given any provocation to make her so; and be not\nweary with listening to me, for it will be for thy good.\n\"When God created our first parent in the earthly paradise, the Holy\nScripture says that he infused sleep into Adam and while he slept took\na rib from his left side of which he formed our mother Eve, and when\nAdam awoke and beheld her he said, 'This is flesh of my flesh, and bone\nof my bone.' And God said 'For this shall a man leave his father and\nhis mother, and they shall be two in one flesh; and then was instituted\nthe divine sacrament of marriage, with such ties that death alone can\nloose them. And such is the force and virtue of this miraculous\nsacrament that it makes two different persons one and the same flesh;\nand even more than this when the virtuous are married; for though they\nhave two souls they have but one will. And hence it follows that as the\nflesh of the wife is one and the same with that of her husband the\nstains that may come upon it, or the injuries it incurs fall upon the\nhusband's flesh, though he, as has been said, may have given no cause\nfor them; for as the pain of the foot or any member of the body is felt\nby the whole body, because all is one flesh, as the head feels the hurt\nto the ankle without having caused it, so the husband, being one with\nher, shares the dishonour of the wife; and as all worldly honour or\ndishonour comes of flesh and blood, and the erring wife's is of that\nkind, the husband must needs bear his part of it and be held\ndishonoured without knowing it. See, then, Anselmo, the peril thou art\nencountering in seeking to disturb the peace of thy virtuous consort;\nsee for what an empty and ill-advised curiosity thou wouldst rouse up\npassions that now repose in quiet in the breast of thy chaste wife;\nreflect that what thou art staking all to win is little, and what thou\nwilt lose so much that I leave it undescribed, not having the words to\nexpress it. But if all I have said be not enough to turn thee from thy\nvile purpose, thou must seek some other instrument for thy dishonour\nand misfortune; for such I will not consent to be, though I lose thy\nfriendship, the greatest loss that I can conceive.\"",

This being so, thou must remember\nthat I am now labouring under that infirmity which women sometimes\nsuffer from, when the craving seizes them to eat clay, plaster,\ncharcoal, and things even worse, disgusting to look at, much more to\neat; so that it will be necessary to have recourse to some artifice to\ncure me; and this can be easily effected if only thou wilt make a\nbeginning, even though it be in a lukewarm and make-believe fashion, to\npay court to Camilla, who will not be so yielding that her virtue will\ngive way at the first attack: with this mere attempt I shall rest\nsatisfied, and thou wilt have done what our friendship binds thee to\ndo, not only in giving me life, but in persuading me not to discard my\nhonour. And this thou art bound to do for one reason alone, that,\nbeing, as I am, resolved to apply this test, it is not for thee to\npermit me to reveal my weakness to another, and so imperil that honour\nthou art striving to keep me from losing; and if thine may not stand as\nhigh as it ought in the estimation of Camilla while thou art paying\ncourt to her, that is of little or no importance, because ere long, on\nfinding in her that constancy which we expect, thou canst tell her the\nplain truth as regards our stratagem, and so regain thy place in her\nesteem; and as thou art venturing so little, and by the venture canst\nafford me so much satisfaction, refuse not to undertake it, even if\nfurther difficulties present themselves to thee; for, as I have said,\nif thou wilt only make a beginning I will acknowledge the issue\ndecided.\"\nLothario seeing the fixed determination of Anselmo, and not knowing\nwhat further examples to offer or arguments to urge in order to\ndissuade him from it, and perceiving that he threatened to confide his\npernicious scheme to someone else, to avoid a greater evil resolved to\ngratify him and do what he asked, intending to manage the business so\nas to satisfy Anselmo without corrupting the mind of Camilla; so in\nreply he told him not to communicate his purpose to any other, for he\nwould undertake the task himself, and would begin it as soon as he\npleased. Anselmo embraced him warmly and affectionately, and thanked\nhim for his offer as if he had bestowed some great favour upon him; and\nit was agreed between them to set about it the next day, Anselmo\naffording opportunity and time to Lothario to converse alone with\nCamilla, and furnishing him with money and jewels to offer and present\nto her. He suggested, too, that he should treat her to music, and write\nverses in her praise, and if he was unwilling to take the trouble of\ncomposing them, he offered to do it himself. Lothario agreed to all\nwith an intention very different from what Anselmo supposed, and with\nthis understanding they returned to Anselmo's house, where they found\nCamilla awaiting her husband anxiously and uneasily, for he was later\nthan usual in returning that day. Lothario repaired to his own house,\nand Anselmo remained in his, as well satisfied as Lothario was troubled\nin mind; for he could see no satisfactory way out of this ill-advised",

The first three days Lothario\ndid not speak to her, though he might have done so when they removed\nthe cloth and the servants retired to dine hastily; for such were\nCamilla's orders; nay more, Leonela had directions to dine earlier than\nCamilla and never to leave her side. She, however, having her thoughts\nfixed upon other things more to her taste, and wanting that time and\nopportunity for her own pleasures, did not always obey her mistress's\ncommands, but on the contrary left them alone, as if they had ordered\nher to do so; but the modest bearing of Camilla, the calmness of her\ncountenance, the composure of her aspect were enough to bridle the\ntongue of Lothario. But the influence which the many virtues of Camilla\nexerted in imposing silence on Lothario's tongue proved mischievous for\nboth of them, for if his tongue was silent his thoughts were busy, and\ncould dwell at leisure upon the perfections of Camilla's goodness and\nbeauty one by one, charms enough to warm with love a marble statue, not\nto say a heart of flesh. Lothario gazed upon her when he might have\nbeen speaking to her, and thought how worthy of being loved she was;\nand thus reflection began little by little to assail his allegiance to\nAnselmo, and a thousand times he thought of withdrawing from the city\nand going where Anselmo should never see him nor he see Camilla. But\nalready the delight he found in gazing on her interposed and held him\nfast. He put a constraint upon himself, and struggled to repel and\nrepress the pleasure he found in contemplating Camilla; when alone he\nblamed himself for his weakness, called himself a bad friend, nay a bad\nChristian; then he argued the matter and compared himself with Anselmo;\nalways coming to the conclusion that the folly and rashness of Anselmo\nhad been worse than his faithlessness, and that if he could excuse his\nintentions as easily before God as with man, he had no reason to fear\nany punishment for his offence.\nIn short the beauty and goodness of Camilla, joined with the\nopportunity which the blind husband had placed in his hands, overthrew\nthe loyalty of Lothario; and giving heed to nothing save the object\ntowards which his inclinations led him, after Anselmo had been three\ndays absent, during which he had been carrying on a continual struggle\nwith his passion, he began to make love to Camilla with so much\nvehemence and warmth of language that she was overwhelmed with\namazement, and could only rise from her place and retire to her room\nwithout answering him a word.

I fear that he will think\nill of my pliancy or lightness, not considering the irresistible\ninfluence he brought to bear upon me.\"\n\"Let not that trouble you, my lady,\" said Leonela, \"for it does not\ntake away the value of the thing given or make it the less precious to\ngive it quickly if it be really valuable and worthy of being prized;\nnay, they are wont to say that he who gives quickly gives twice.\"\n\"They say also,\" said Camilla, \"that what costs little is valued less.\"\n\"That saying does not hold good in your case,\" replied Leonela, \"for\nlove, as I have heard say, sometimes flies and sometimes walks; with\nthis one it runs, with that it moves slowly; some it cools, others it\nburns; some it wounds, others it slays; it begins the course of its\ndesires, and at the same moment completes and ends it; in the morning\nit will lay siege to a fortress and by night will have taken it, for\nthere is no power that can resist it; so what are you in dread of, what\ndo you fear, when the same must have befallen Lothario, love having\nchosen the absence of my lord as the instrument for subduing you? and\nit was absolutely necessary to complete then what love had resolved\nupon, without affording the time to let Anselmo return and by his\npresence compel the work to be left unfinished; for love has no better\nagent for carrying out his designs than opportunity; and of opportunity\nhe avails himself in all his feats, especially at the outset. All this\nI know well myself, more by experience than by hearsay, and some day,\nse\u00f1ora, I will enlighten you on the subject, for I am of your flesh and\nblood too. Moreover, lady Camilla, you did not surrender yourself or\nyield so quickly but that first you saw Lothario's whole soul in his\neyes, in his sighs, in his words, his promises and his gifts, and by it\nand his good qualities perceived how worthy he was of your love. This,\nthen, being the case, let not these scrupulous and prudish ideas\ntrouble your imagination, but be assured that Lothario prizes you as\nyou do him, and rest content and satisfied that as you are caught in\nthe noose of love it is one of worth and merit that has taken you, and\none that has not only the four S's that they say true lovers ought to\nhave, but a complete alphabet; only listen to me and you will see how I\ncan repeat it by rote.

Camilla was uneasy at this, dreading lest\nit might prove the means of endangering her honour, and asked whether\nher intrigue had gone beyond words, and she with little shame and much\neffrontery said it had; for certain it is that ladies' imprudences make\nservants shameless, who, when they see their mistresses make a false\nstep, think nothing of going astray themselves, or of its being known.\nAll that Camilla could do was to entreat Leonela to say nothing about\nher doings to him whom she called her lover, and to conduct her own\naffairs secretly lest they should come to the knowledge of Anselmo or",

But no; there is no\nreason why I should suffer the punishment of another's fault. I will\nfirst know what it is that the bold licentious eyes of Lothario have\nseen in me that could have encouraged him to reveal to me a design so\nbase as that which he has disclosed regardless of his friend and of my\nhonour. Go to the window, Leonela, and call him, for no doubt he is in\nthe street waiting to carry out his vile project; but mine, cruel it\nmay be, but honourable, shall be carried out first.\"\n\"Ah, se\u00f1ora,\" said the crafty Leonela, who knew her part, \"what is it\nyou want to do with this dagger? Can it be that you mean to take your\nown life, or Lothario's? for whichever you mean to do, it will lead to\nthe loss of your reputation and good name. It is better to dissemble\nyour wrong and not give this wicked man the chance of entering the\nhouse now and finding us alone; consider, se\u00f1ora, we are weak women and\nhe is a man, and determined, and as he comes with such a base purpose,\nblind and urged by passion, perhaps before you can put yours into\nexecution he may do what will be worse for you than taking your life.\nIll betide my master, Anselmo, for giving such authority in his house\nto this shameless fellow! And supposing you kill him, se\u00f1ora, as I\nsuspect you mean to do, what shall we do with him when he is dead?\"\n\"What, my friend?\" replied Camilla, \"we shall leave him for Anselmo to\nbury him; for in reason it will be to him a light labour to hide his\nown infamy under ground. Summon him, make haste, for all the time I\ndelay in taking vengeance for my wrong seems to me an offence against\nthe loyalty I owe my husband.\"\nAnselmo was listening to all this, and every word that Camilla uttered\nmade him change his mind; but when he heard that it was resolved to\nkill Lothario his first impulse was to come out and show himself to\navert such a disaster; but in his anxiety to see the issue of a\nresolution so bold and virtuous he restrained himself, intending to\ncome forth in time to prevent the deed. At this moment Camilla,\nthrowing herself upon a bed that was close by, swooned away, and\nLeonela began to weep bitterly, exclaiming, \"Woe is me! that I should\nbe fated to have dying here in my arms the flower of virtue upon earth,\nthe crown of true wives, the pattern of chastity!\" with more to the\nsame effect, so that anyone who heard her would have taken her for the\nmost tender-hearted and faithful handmaid in the world, and her\nmistress for another persecuted Penelope.\nCamilla was not long in recovering from her fainting fit and on coming\nto herself she said, \"Why do you not go, Leonela, to call hither that\nfriend, the falsest to his friend the sun ever shone upon or night\nconcealed? Away, run, haste, speed! lest the fire of my wrath burn\nitself out with delay, and the righteous vengeance that I hope for melt\naway in menaces and maledictions.\"\n\"I am just going to call him, se\u00f1ora,\" said Leonela; \"but you must\nfirst give me that dagger, lest while I am gone you should by means of\nit give cause to all who love you to weep all their lives.\"\n\"Go in peace, dear Leonela, I will not do so,\" said Camilla, \"for rash\nand foolish as I may be, to your mind, in defending my honour, I am not\ngoing to be so much so as that Lucretia who they say killed herself\nwithout having done anything wrong, and without having first killed him\non whom the guilt of her misfortune lay. I shall die, if I am to die;\nbut it must be after full vengeance upon him who has brought me here to\nweep over audacity that no fault of mine gave birth to.\"\nLeonela required much pressing before she would go to summon Lothario,\nbut at last she went, and while awaiting her return Camilla continued,\nas if speaking to herself, \"Good God! would it not have been more\nprudent to have repulsed Lothario, as I have done many a time before,\nthan to allow him, as I am now doing, to think me unchaste and vile,\neven for the short time I must wait until I undeceive him? No doubt it\nwould have been better; but I should not be avenged, nor the honour of\nmy husband vindicated, should he find so clear and easy an escape from\nthe strait into which his depravity has led him. Let the traitor pay\nwith his life for the temerity of his wanton wishes, and let the world\nknow (if haply it shall ever come to know) that Camilla not only\npreserved her allegiance to her husband, but avenged him of the man who\ndared to wrong him. Still, I think it might be better to disclose this\nto Anselmo. But then I have called his attention to it in the letter I\nwrote to him in the country, and, if he did nothing to prevent the\nmischief I there pointed out to him, I suppose it was that from pure\ngoodness of heart and trustfulness he would not and could not believe\nthat any thought against his honour could harbour in the breast of so\nstanch a friend; nor indeed did I myself believe it for many days, nor\nshould I have ever believed it if his insolence had not gone so far as\nto make it manifest by open presents, lavish promises, and ceaseless\ntears. But why do I argue thus? Does a bold determination stand in need\nof arguments? Surely not. Then traitors avaunt! Vengeance to my aid!\nLet the false one come, approach, advance, die, yield up his life, and\nthen befall what may. Pure I came to him whom Heaven bestowed upon me,\npure I shall leave him; and at the worst bathed in my own chaste blood\nand in the foul blood of the falsest friend that friendship ever saw in",

Leonela took her up in her arms and laid her on the bed,\nentreating Lothario to go in quest of someone to attend to her wound in\nsecret, and at the same time asking his advice and opinion as to what\nthey should say to Anselmo about his lady's wound if he should chance\nto return before it was healed. He replied they might say what they\nliked, for he was not in a state to give advice that would be of any\nuse; all he could tell her was to try and stanch the blood, as he was\ngoing where he should never more be seen; and with every appearance of\ndeep grief and sorrow he left the house; but when he found himself\nalone, and where there was nobody to see him, he crossed himself\nunceasingly, lost in wonder at the adroitness of Camilla and the\nconsistent acting of Leonela. He reflected how convinced Anselmo would\nbe that he had a second Portia for a wife, and he looked forward\nanxiously to meeting him in order to rejoice together over falsehood\nand truth the most craftily veiled that could be imagined.\nLeonela, as he told her, stanched her lady's blood, which was no more\nthan sufficed to support her deception; and washing the wound with a\nlittle wine she bound it up to the best of her skill, talking all the\ntime she was tending her in a strain that, even if nothing else had\nbeen said before, would have been enough to assure Anselmo that he had\nin Camilla a model of purity.

He himself, persuaded he was conducting the instrument\nof his glory, led home by the hand of him who had been the utter\ndestruction of his good name; whom Camilla received with averted\ncountenance, though with smiles in her heart.

But the befooled Anselmo said he would on no account\nallow such a thing, and so in a thousand ways he became the author of\nhis own dishonour, while he believed he was insuring his happiness.\nMeanwhile the satisfaction with which Leonela saw herself empowered to\ncarry on her amour reached such a height that, regardless of everything\nelse, she followed her inclinations unrestrainedly, feeling confident\nthat her mistress would screen her, and even show her how to manage it\nsafely. At last one night Anselmo heard footsteps in Leonela's room,\nand on trying to enter to see who it was, he found that the door was\nheld against him, which made him all the more determined to open it;\nand exerting his strength he forced it open, and entered the room in\ntime to see a man leaping through the window into the street. He ran\nquickly to seize him or discover who he was, but he was unable to\neffect either purpose, for Leonela flung her arms round him crying, \"Be\ncalm, se\u00f1or; do not give way to passion or follow him who has escaped\nfrom this; he belongs to me, and in fact he is my husband.\"\nAnselmo would not believe it, but blind with rage drew a dagger and\nthreatened to stab Leonela, bidding her tell the truth or he would kill\nher. She, in her fear, not knowing what she was saying, exclaimed, \"Do\nnot kill me, se\u00f1or, for I can tell you things more important than any\nyou can imagine.\"\n\"Tell me then at once or thou diest,\" said Anselmo.\n\"It would be impossible for me now,\" said Leonela, \"I am so agitated:\nleave me till to-morrow, and then you shall hear from me what will fill\nyou with astonishment; but rest assured that he who leaped through the\nwindow is a young man of this city, who has given me his promise to\nbecome my husband.\"\nAnselmo was appeased with this, and was content to wait the time she\nasked of him, for he never expected to hear anything against Camilla,\nso satisfied and sure of her virtue was he; and so he quitted the room,\nand left Leonela locked in, telling her she should not come out until\nshe had told him all she had to make known to him. He went at once to\nsee Camilla, and tell her, as he did, all that had passed between him\nand her handmaid, and the promise she had given him to inform him\nmatters of serious importance.\nThere is no need of saying whether Camilla was agitated or not, for so\ngreat was her fear and dismay, that, making sure, as she had good\nreason to do, that Leonela would tell Anselmo all she knew of her\nfaithlessness, she had not the courage to wait and see if her\nsuspicions were confirmed; and that same night, as soon as she thought\nthat Anselmo was asleep, she packed up the most valuable jewels she had\nand some money, and without being observed by anybody escaped from the\nhouse and betook herself to Lothario's, to whom she related what had\noccurred, imploring him to convey her to some place of safety or fly\nwith her where they might be safe from Anselmo. The state of perplexity\nto which Camilla reduced Lothario was such that he was unable to utter\na word in reply, still less to decide upon what he should do. At length\nhe resolved to conduct her to a convent of which a sister of his was\nprioress; Camilla agreed to this, and with the speed which the\ncircumstances demanded, Lothario took her to the convent and left her\nthere, and then himself quitted the city without letting anyone know of\nhis departure.",

He got up as well as he was able and reached\nthe house of his friend, who as yet knew nothing of his misfortune, but\nseeing him come pale, worn, and haggard, perceived that he was\nsuffering some heavy affliction. Anselmo at once begged to be allowed\nto retire to rest, and to be given writing materials. His wish was\ncomplied with and he was left lying down and alone, for he desired\nthis, and even that the door should be locked. Finding himself alone he\nso took to heart the thought of his misfortune that by the signs of\ndeath he felt within him he knew well his life was drawing to a close,\nand therefore he resolved to leave behind him a declaration of the\ncause of his strange end. He began to write, but before he had put down\nall he meant to say, his breath failed him and he yielded up his life,\na victim to the suffering which his ill-advised curiosity had entailed\nupon him. The master of the house observing that it was now late and\nthat Anselmo did not call, determined to go in and ascertain if his\nindisposition was increasing, and found him lying on his face, his body\npartly in the bed, partly on the writing-table, on which he lay with\nthe written paper open and the pen still in his hand. Having first\ncalled to him without receiving any answer, his host approached him,\nand taking him by the hand, found that it was cold, and saw that he was\ndead. Greatly surprised and distressed he summoned the household to\nwitness the sad fate which had befallen Anselmo; and then he read the\npaper, the handwriting of which he recognised as his, and which\ncontained these words:\n\"A foolish and ill-advised desire has robbed me of life. If the news of\nmy death should reach the ears of Camilla, let her know that I forgive\nher, for she was not bound to perform miracles, nor ought I to have\nrequired her to perform them; and since I have been the author of my\nown dishonour, there is no reason why\u2014\"\nSo far Anselmo had written, and thus it was plain that at this point,\nbefore he could finish what he had to say, his life came to an end. The\nnext day his friend sent intelligence of his death to his relatives,\nwho had already ascertained his misfortune, as well as the convent\nwhere Camilla lay almost on the point of accompanying her husband on\nthat inevitable journey, not on account of the tidings of his death,\nbut because of those she received of her lover's departure. Although\nshe saw herself a widow, it is said she refused either to quit the\nconvent or take the veil, until, not long afterwards, intelligence\nreached her that Lothario had been killed in a battle in which M. de\nLautrec had been recently engaged with the Great Captain Gonzalo\nFernandez de Cordova in the kingdom of Naples, whither her too late\nrepentant lover had repaired. On learning this Camilla took the veil,\nand shortly afterwards died, worn out by grief and melancholy. This was\nthe end of all three, an end that came of a thoughtless beginning.",

The first to break silence was Luscinda, who thus addressed\nDon Fernando: \"Leave me, Se\u00f1or Don Fernando, for the sake of what you\nowe to yourself; if no other reason will induce you, leave me to cling\nto the wall of which I am the ivy, to the support from which neither\nyour importunities, nor your threats, nor your promises, nor your gifts\nhave been able to detach me. See how Heaven, by ways strange and hidden\nfrom our sight, has brought me face to face with my true husband; and\nwell you know by dear-bought experience that death alone will be able\nto efface him from my memory. May this plain declaration, then, lead\nyou, as you can do nothing else, to turn your love into rage, your\naffection into resentment, and so to take my life; for if I yield it up\nin the presence of my beloved husband I count it well bestowed; it may\nbe by my death he will be convinced that I kept my faith to him to the\nlast moment of life.\"\nMeanwhile Dorothea had come to herself, and had heard Luscinda's words,\nby means of which she divined who she was; but seeing that Don Fernando\ndid not yet release her or reply to her, summoning up her resolution as\nwell as she could she rose and knelt at his feet, and with a flood of\nbright and touching tears addressed him thus:\n\"If, my lord, the beams of that sun that thou holdest eclipsed in thine\narms did not dazzle and rob thine eyes of sight thou wouldst have seen\nby this time that she who kneels at thy feet is, so long as thou wilt\nhave it so, the unhappy and unfortunate Dorothea. I am that lowly\npeasant girl whom thou in thy goodness or for thy pleasure wouldst\nraise high enough to call herself thine; I am she who in the seclusion\nof innocence led a contented life until at the voice of thy\nimportunity, and thy true and tender passion, as it seemed, she opened\nthe gates of her modesty and surrendered to thee the keys of her\nliberty; a gift received by thee but thanklessly, as is clearly shown\nby my forced retreat to the place where thou dost find me, and by thy\nappearance under the circumstances in which I see thee. Nevertheless, I\nwould not have thee suppose that I have come here driven by my shame;\nit is only grief and sorrow at seeing myself forgotten by thee that\nhave led me. It was thy will to make me thine, and thou didst so follow\nthy will, that now, even though thou repentest, thou canst not help\nbeing mine. Bethink thee, my lord, the unsurpassable affection I bear\nthee may compensate for the beauty and noble birth for which thou\nwouldst desert me. Thou canst not be the fair Luscinda's because thou\nart mine, nor can she be thine because she is Cardenio's; and it will\nbe easier, remember, to bend thy will to love one who adores thee, than\nto lead one to love thee who abhors thee now. Thou didst address\nthyself to my simplicity, thou didst lay siege to my virtue, thou wert\nnot ignorant of my station, well dost thou know how I yielded wholly to\nthy will; there is no ground or reason for thee to plead deception, and\nif it be so, as it is, and if thou art a Christian as thou art a\ngentleman, why dost thou by such subterfuges put off making me as happy\nat last as thou didst at first? And if thou wilt not have me for what I\nam, thy true and lawful wife, at least take and accept me as thy slave,\nfor so long as I am thine I will count myself happy and fortunate. Do\nnot by deserting me let my shame become the talk of the gossips in the\nstreets; make not the old age of my parents miserable; for the loyal\nservices they as faithful vassals have ever rendered thine are not\ndeserving of such a return; and if thou thinkest it will debase thy\nblood to mingle it with mine, reflect that there is little or no\nnobility in the world that has not travelled the same road, and that in\nillustrious lineages it is not the woman's blood that is of account;\nand, moreover, that true nobility consists in virtue, and if thou art\nwanting in that, refusing me what in justice thou owest me, then even I\nhave higher claims to nobility than thine. To make an end, se\u00f1or, these\nare my last words to thee: whether thou wilt, or wilt not, I am thy\nwife; witness thy words, which must not and ought not to be false, if\nthou dost pride thyself on that for want of which thou scornest me;\nwitness the pledge which thou didst give me, and witness Heaven, which\nthou thyself didst call to witness the promise thou hadst made me; and\nif all this fail, thy own conscience will not fail to lift up its\nsilent voice in the midst of all thy gaiety, and vindicate the truth of\nwhat I say and mar thy highest pleasure and enjoyment.\"",

            "text": "All this and more the injured Dorothea delivered with such earnest\nfeeling and such tears that all present, even those who came with Don\nFernando, were constrained to join her in them. Don Fernando listened\nto her without replying, until, ceasing to speak, she gave way to such\nsobs and sighs that it must have been a heart of brass that was not\nsoftened by the sight of so great sorrow. Luscinda stood regarding her\nwith no less compassion for her sufferings than admiration for her\nintelligence and beauty, and would have gone to her to say some words\nof comfort to her, but was prevented by Don Fernando's grasp which held\nher fast. He, overwhelmed with confusion and astonishment, after\nregarding Dorothea for some moments with a fixed gaze, opened his arms,\nand, releasing Luscinda, exclaimed:\n\"Thou hast conquered, fair Dorothea, thou hast conquered, for it is\nimpossible to have the heart to deny the united force of so many\ntruths.\"\nLuscinda in her feebleness was on the point of falling to the ground\nwhen Don Fernando released her, but Cardenio, who stood near, having\nretreated behind Don Fernando to escape recognition, casting fear aside\nand regardless of what might happen, ran forward to support her, and\nsaid as he clasped her in his arms, \"If Heaven in its compassion is\nwilling to let thee rest at last, mistress of my heart, true, constant,\nand fair, nowhere canst thou rest more safely than in these arms that\nnow receive thee, and received thee before when fortune permitted me to\ncall thee mine.\"\nAt these words Luscinda looked up at Cardenio, at first beginning to\nrecognise him by his voice and then satisfying herself by her eyes that\nit was he, and hardly knowing what she did, and heedless of all\nconsiderations of decorum, she flung her arms around his neck and\npressing her face close to his, said, \"Yes, my dear lord, you are the\ntrue master of this your slave, even though adverse fate interpose\nagain, and fresh dangers threaten this life that hangs on yours.\"\nA strange sight was this for Don Fernando and those that stood around,\nfilled with surprise at an incident so unlooked for. Dorothea fancied\nthat Don Fernando changed colour and looked as though he meant to take\nvengeance on Cardenio, for she observed him put his hand to his sword;\nand the instant the idea struck her, with wonderful quickness she\nclasped him round the knees, and kissing them and holding him so as to\nprevent his moving, she said, while her tears continued to flow, \"What\nis it thou wouldst do, my only refuge, in this unforeseen event? Thou\nhast thy wife at thy feet, and she whom thou wouldst have for thy wife\nis in the arms of her husband: reflect whether it will be right for\nthee, whether it will be possible for thee to undo what Heaven has\ndone, or whether it will be becoming in thee to seek to raise her to be\nthy mate who in spite of every obstacle, and strong in her truth and\nconstancy, is before thine eyes, bathing with the tears of love the\nface and bosom of her lawful husband. For God's sake I entreat of thee,\nfor thine own I implore thee, let not this open manifestation rouse thy\nanger; but rather so calm it as to allow these two lovers to live in\npeace and quiet without any interference from thee so long as Heaven\npermits them; and in so doing thou wilt prove the generosity of thy\nlofty noble spirit, and the world shall see that with thee reason has\nmore influence than passion.\"\nAll the time Dorothea was speaking, Cardenio, though he held Luscinda\nin his arms, never took his eyes off Don Fernando, determined, if he\nsaw him make any hostile movement, to try and defend himself and resist\nas best he could all who might assail him, though it should cost him\nhis life. But now Don Fernando's friends, as well as the curate and the\nbarber, who had been present all the while, not forgetting the worthy\nSancho Panza, ran forward and gathered round Don Fernando, entreating\nhim to have regard for the tears of Dorothea, and not suffer her\nreasonable hopes to be disappointed, since, as they firmly believed,\nwhat she said was but the truth; and bidding him observe that it was\nnot, as it might seem, by accident, but by a special disposition of\nProvidence that they had all met in a place where no one could have\nexpected a meeting. And the curate bade him remember that only death\ncould part Luscinda from Cardenio; that even if some sword were to\nseparate them they would think their death most happy; and that in a\ncase that admitted of no remedy his wisest course was, by conquering\nand putting a constraint upon himself, to show a generous mind, and of\nhis own accord suffer these two to enjoy the happiness Heaven had\ngranted them. He bade him, too, turn his eyes upon the beauty of\nDorothea and he would see that few if any could equal much less excel\nher; while to that beauty should be added her modesty and the\nsurpassing love she bore him. But besides all this, he reminded him\nthat if he prided himself on being a gentleman and a Christian, he\ncould not do otherwise than keep his plighted word; and that in doing\nso he would obey God and meet the approval of all sensible people, who\nknow and recognised it to be the privilege of beauty, even in one of\nhumble birth, provided virtue accompany it, to be able to raise itself\nto the level of any rank, without any slur upon him who places it upon\nan equality with himself; and furthermore that when the potent sway of\npassion asserts itself, so long as there be no mixture of sin in it, he\nis not to be blamed who gives way to it.\nTo be brief, they added to these such other forcible arguments that Don\nFernando's manly heart, being after all nourished by noble blood, was\ntouched, and yielded to the truth which, even had he wished it, he\ncould not gainsay; and he showed his submission, and acceptance of the\ngood advice that had been offered to him, by stooping down and\nembracing Dorothea, saying to her, \"Rise, dear lady, it is not right\nthat what I hold in my heart should be kneeling at my feet; and if\nuntil now I have shown no sign of what I own, it may have been by\nHeaven's decree in order that, seeing the constancy with which you love\nme, I may learn to value you as you deserve. What I entreat of you is\nthat you reproach me not with my transgression and grievous\nwrong-doing; for the same cause and force that drove me to make you\nmine impelled me to struggle against being yours; and to prove this,\nturn and look at the eyes of the now happy Luscinda, and you will see\nin them an excuse for all my errors: and as she has found and gained\nthe object of her desires, and I have found in you what satisfies all\nmy wishes, may she live in peace and contentment as many happy years\nwith her Cardenio, as on my knees I pray Heaven to allow me to live\nwith my Dorothea;\" and with these words he once more embraced her and\npressed his face to hers with so much tenderness that he had to take\ngreat heed to keep his tears from completing the proof of his love and\nrepentance in the sight of all. Not so Luscinda, and Cardenio, and\nalmost all the others, for they shed so many tears, some in their own\nhappiness, some at that of the others, that one would have supposed a\nheavy calamity had fallen upon them all.

Their wonder as well as their weeping lasted some time, and\nthen Cardenio and Luscinda went and fell on their knees before Don\nFernando, returning him thanks for the favour he had rendered them in\nlanguage so grateful that he knew not how to answer them, and raising\nthem up embraced them with every mark of affection and courtesy.",

When she\nhad finished Don Fernando recounted what had befallen him in the city\nafter he had found in Luscinda's bosom the paper in which she declared\nthat she was Cardenio's wife, and never could be his. He said he meant\nto kill her, and would have done so had he not been prevented by her\nparents, and that he quitted the house full of rage and shame, and\nresolved to avenge himself when a more convenient opportunity should\noffer. The next day he learned that Luscinda had disappeared from her\nfather's house, and that no one could tell whither she had gone.\nFinally, at the end of some months he ascertained that she was in a\nconvent and meant to remain there all the rest of her life, if she were\nnot to share it with Cardenio; and as soon as he had learned this,\ntaking these three gentlemen as his companions, he arrived at the place\nwhere she was, but avoided speaking to her, fearing that if it were\nknown he was there stricter precautions would be taken in the convent;\nand watching a time when the porter's lodge was open he left two to\nguard the gate, and he and the other entered the convent in quest of\nLuscinda, whom they found in the cloisters in conversation with one of\nthe nuns, and carrying her off without giving her time to resist, they\nreached a place with her where they provided themselves with what they\nrequired for taking her away; all which they were able to do in\ncomplete safety, as the convent was in the country at a considerable\ndistance from the city. He added that when Luscinda found herself in\nhis power she lost all consciousness, and after returning to herself\ndid nothing but weep and sigh without speaking a word; and thus in\nsilence and tears they reached that inn, which for him was reaching\nheaven where all the mischances of earth are over and at an end.",

The curate as a sensible man made sound\nreflections upon the whole affair, and congratulated each upon his good\nfortune; but the one that was in the highest spirits and good humour\nwas the landlady, because of the promise Cardenio and the curate had\ngiven her to pay for all the losses and damage she had sustained\nthrough Don Quixote's means. Sancho, as has been already said, was the\nonly one who was distressed, unhappy, and dejected; and so with a long\nface he went in to his master, who had just awoke, and said to him:\n\"Sir Rueful Countenance, your worship may as well sleep on as much as\nyou like, without troubling yourself about killing any giant or\nrestoring her kingdom to the princess; for that is all over and settled\nnow.\"",

Dorothea took\nthe Moorish lady by the hand and leading her to a seat beside herself,\nrequested her to remove her veil. She looked at the captive as if to\nask him what they meant and what she was to do. He said to her in\nArabic that they asked her to take off her veil, and thereupon she\nremoved it and disclosed a countenance so lovely, that to Dorothea she\nseemed more beautiful than Luscinda, and to Luscinda more beautiful\nthan Dorothea, and all the bystanders felt that if any beauty could\ncompare with theirs it was the Moorish lady's, and there were even\nthose who were inclined to give it somewhat the preference. And as it\nis the privilege and charm of beauty to win the heart and secure\ngood-will, all forthwith became eager to show kindness and attention to\nthe lovely Moor.\nDon Fernando asked the captive what her name was, and he replied that\nit was Lela Zoraida; but the instant she heard him, she guessed what\nthe Christian had asked, and said hastily, with some displeasure and\nenergy, \"No, not Zoraida; Maria, Maria!\" giving them to understand that\nshe was called \"Maria\" and not \"Zoraida.\" These words, and the touching\nearnestness with which she uttered them, drew more than one tear from\nsome of the listeners, particularly the women, who are by nature\ntender-hearted and compassionate. Luscinda embraced her affectionately,\nsaying, \"Yes, yes, Maria, Maria,\" to which the Moor replied, \"Yes, yes,\nMaria; Zoraida macange,\" which means \"not Zoraida.\"\nNight was now approaching, and by the orders of those who accompanied\nDon Fernando the landlord had taken care and pains to prepare for them\nthe best supper that was in his power. The hour therefore having\narrived they all took their seats at a long table like a refectory one,\nfor round or square table there was none in the inn, and the seat of\nhonour at the head of it, though he was for refusing it, they assigned\nto Don Quixote, who desired the lady Micomicona to place herself by his\nside, as he was her protector. Luscinda and Zoraida took their places\nnext her, opposite to them were Don Fernando and Cardenio, and next the\ncaptive and the other gentlemen, and by the side of the ladies, the\ncurate and the barber.

Who would say that this lady who is\nbeside me was the great queen that we all know her to be, or that I am\nthat Knight of the Rueful Countenance, trumpeted far and wide by the\nmouth of Fame? Now, there can be no doubt that this art and calling\nsurpasses all those that mankind has invented, and is the more\ndeserving of being held in honour in proportion as it is the more\nexposed to peril. Away with those who assert that letters have the\npreeminence over arms; I will tell them, whosoever they may be, that\nthey know not what they say. For the reason which such persons commonly\nassign, and upon which they chiefly rest, is, that the labours of the\nmind are greater than those of the body, and that arms give employment\nto the body alone; as if the calling were a porter's trade, for which\nnothing more is required than sturdy strength; or as if, in what we who\nprofess them call arms, there were not included acts of vigour for the\nexecution of which high intelligence is requisite; or as if the soul of\nthe warrior, when he has an army, or the defence of a city under his\ncare, did not exert itself as much by mind as by body. Nay; see whether\nby bodily strength it be possible to learn or divine the intentions of\nthe enemy, his plans, stratagems, or obstacles, or to ward off\nimpending mischief; for all these are the work of the mind, and in them\nthe body has no share whatever. Since, therefore, arms have need of the\nmind, as much as letters, let us see now which of the two minds, that\nof the man of letters or that of the warrior, has most to do; and this\nwill be seen by the end and goal that each seeks to attain; for that\npurpose is the more estimable which has for its aim the nobler object.\nThe end and goal of letters\u2014I am not speaking now of divine letters,\nthe aim of which is to raise and direct the soul to Heaven; for with an\nend so infinite no other can be compared\u2014I speak of human letters, the\nend of which is to establish distributive justice, give to every man\nthat which is his, and see and take care that good laws are observed:\nan end undoubtedly noble, lofty, and deserving of high praise, but not\nsuch as should be given to that sought by arms, which have for their\nend and object peace, the greatest boon that men can desire in this\nlife. The first good news the world and mankind received was that which\nthe angels announced on the night that was our day, when they sang in\nthe air, 'Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of\ngood-will;' and the salutation which the great Master of heaven and\nearth taught his disciples and chosen followers when they entered any\nhouse, was to say, 'Peace be on this house;' and many other times he\nsaid to them, 'My peace I give unto you, my peace I leave you, peace be\nwith you;' a jewel and a precious gift given and left by such a hand: a\njewel without which there can be no happiness either on earth or in\nheaven. This peace is the true end of war; and war is only another name\nfor arms. This, then, being admitted, that the end of war is peace, and\nthat so far it has the advantage of the end of letters, let us turn to\nthe bodily labours of the man of letters, and those of him who follows\nthe profession of arms, and see which are the greater.\"\nDon Quixote delivered his discourse in such a manner and in such\ncorrect language, that for the time being he made it impossible for any\nof his hearers to consider him a madman; on the contrary, as they were\nmostly gentlemen, to whom arms are an appurtenance by birth, they\nlistened to him with great pleasure as he continued: \"Here, then, I say\nis what the student has to undergo; first of all poverty: not that all\nare poor, but to put the case as strongly as possible: and when I have\nsaid that he endures poverty, I think nothing more need be said about\nhis hard fortune, for he who is poor has no share of the good things of\nlife. This poverty he suffers from in various ways, hunger, or cold, or\nnakedness, or all together; but for all that it is not so extreme but\nthat he gets something to eat, though it may be at somewhat\nunseasonable hours and from the leavings of the rich; for the greatest\nmisery of the student is what they themselves call 'going out for\nsoup,' and there is always some neighbour's brazier or hearth for them,\nwhich, if it does not warm, at least tempers the cold to them, and\nlastly, they sleep comfortably at night under a roof. I will not go\ninto other particulars, as for example want of shirts, and no\nsuperabundance of shoes, thin and threadbare garments, and gorging\nthemselves to surfeit in their voracity when good luck has treated them\nto a banquet of some sort. By this road that I have described, rough\nand hard, stumbling here, falling there, getting up again to fall\nagain, they reach the rank they desire, and that once attained, we have\nseen many who have passed these Syrtes and Scyllas and Charybdises, as\nif borne flying on the wings of favouring fortune; we have seen them, I\nsay, ruling and governing the world from a chair, their hunger turned\ninto satiety, their cold into comfort, their nakedness into fine\nraiment, their sleep on a mat into repose in holland and damask, the\njustly earned reward of their virtue; but, contrasted and compared with\nwhat the warrior undergoes, all they have undergone falls far short of\nit, as I am now about to show.\"\nc37e.jpg (13K)\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\nWHICH TREATS OF THE CURIOUS DISCOURSE DON QUIXOTE DELIVERED ON ARMS AND\nLETTERS\nc38a.jpg (180K)\nFull Size\nContinuing his discourse Don Quixote said: \"As we began in the\nstudent's case with poverty and its accompaniments, let us see now if\nthe soldier is richer, and we shall find that in poverty itself there\nis no one poorer; for he is dependent on his miserable pay, which comes\nlate or never, or else on what he can plunder, seriously imperilling\nhis life and conscience; and sometimes his nakedness will be so great\nthat a slashed doublet serves him for uniform and shirt, and in the\ndepth of winter he has to defend himself against the inclemency of the\nweather in the open field with nothing better than the breath of his\nmouth, which I need not say, coming from an empty place, must come out\ncold, contrary to the laws of nature. To be sure he looks forward to\nthe approach of night to make up for all these discomforts on the bed\nthat awaits him, which, unless by some fault of his, never sins by\nbeing over narrow, for he can easily measure out on the ground as he\nlikes, and roll himself about in it to his heart's content without any\nfear of the sheets slipping away from him. Then, after all this,\nsuppose the day and hour for taking his degree in his calling to have\ncome; suppose the day of battle to have arrived, when they invest him\nwith the doctor's cap made of lint, to mend some bullet-hole, perhaps,\nthat has gone through his temples, or left him with a crippled arm or\nleg. Or if this does not happen, and merciful Heaven watches over him\nand keeps him safe and sound, it may be he will be in the same poverty\nhe was in before, and he must go through more engagements and more\nbattles, and come victorious out of all before he betters himself; but\nmiracles of that sort are seldom seen. For tell me, sirs, if you have\never reflected upon it, by how much do those who have gained by war\nfall short of the number of those who have perished in it? No doubt you\nwill reply that there can be no comparison, that the dead cannot be\nnumbered, while the living who have been rewarded may be summed up with\nthree figures. All which is the reverse in the case of men of letters;\nfor by skirts, to say nothing of sleeves, they all find means of\nsupport; so that though the soldier has more to endure, his reward is\nmuch less. But against all this it may be urged that it is easier to\nreward two thousand soldiers, for the former may be remunerated by\ngiving them places, which must perforce be conferred upon men of their\ncalling, while the latter can only be recompensed out of the very\nproperty of the master they serve; but this impossibility only\nstrengthens my argument.\n\"Putting this, however, aside, for it is a puzzling question for which\nit is difficult to find a solution, let us return to the superiority of\narms over letters, a matter still undecided, so many are the arguments\nput forward on each side; for besides those I have mentioned, letters\nsay that without them arms cannot maintain themselves, for war, too,\nhas its laws and is governed by them, and laws belong to the domain of\nletters and men of letters. To this arms make answer that without them\nlaws cannot be maintained, for by arms states are defended, kingdoms\npreserved, cities protected, roads made safe, seas cleared of pirates;\nand, in short, if it were not for them, states, kingdoms, monarchies,\ncities, ways by sea and land would be exposed to the violence and\nconfusion which war brings with it, so long as it lasts and is free to\nmake use of its privileges and powers. And then it is plain that\nwhatever costs most is valued and deserves to be valued most. To attain\nto eminence in letters costs a man time, watching, hunger, nakedness,\nheadaches, indigestions, and other things of the sort, some of which I\nhave already referred to. But for a man to come in the ordinary course\nof things to be a good soldier costs him all the student suffers, and\nin an incomparably higher degree, for at every step he runs the risk of\nlosing his life. For what dread of want or poverty that can reach or\nharass the student can compare with what the soldier feels, who finds\nhimself beleaguered in some stronghold mounting guard in some ravelin\nor cavalier, knows that the enemy is pushing a mine towards the post\nwhere he is stationed, and cannot under any circumstances retire or fly\nfrom the imminent danger that threatens him? All he can do is to inform\nhis captain of what is going on so that he may try to remedy it by a\ncounter-mine, and then stand his ground in fear and expectation of the\nmoment when he will fly up to the clouds without wings and descend into\nthe deep against his will. And if this seems a trifling risk, let us\nsee whether it is equalled or surpassed by the encounter of two galleys\nstem to stem, in the midst of the open sea, locked and entangled one\nwith the other, when the soldier has no more standing room than two\nfeet of the plank of the spur; and yet, though he sees before him\nthreatening him as many ministers of death as there are cannon of the\nfoe pointed at him, not a lance length from his body, and sees too that\nwith the first heedless step he will go down to visit the profundities\nof Neptune's bosom, still with dauntless heart, urged on by honour that\nnerves him, he makes himself a target for all that musketry, and\nstruggles to cross that narrow path to the enemy's ship. And what is\nstill more marvellous, no sooner has one gone down into the depths he\nwill never rise from till the end of the world, than another takes his\nplace; and if he too falls into the sea that waits for him like an\nenemy, another and another will succeed him without a moment's pause\nbetween their deaths: courage and daring the greatest that all the\nchances of war can show. Happy the blest ages that knew not the dread\nfury of those devilish engines of artillery, whose inventor I am\npersuaded is in hell receiving the reward of his diabolical invention,\nby which he made it easy for a base and cowardly arm to take the life\nof a gallant gentleman; and that, when he knows not how or whence, in\nthe height of the ardour and enthusiasm that fire and animate brave\nhearts, there should come some random bullet, discharged perhaps by one\nwho fled in terror at the flash when he fired off his accursed machine,\nwhich in an instant puts an end to the projects and cuts off the life\nof one who deserved to live for ages to come. And thus when I reflect\non this, I am almost tempted to say that in my heart I repent of having\nadopted this profession of knight-errant in so detestable an age as we\nlive in now; for though no peril can make me fear, still it gives me\nsome uneasiness to think that powder and lead may rob me of the\nopportunity of making myself famous and renowned throughout the known\nearth by the might of my arm and the edge of my sword. But Heaven's\nwill be done; if I succeed in my attempt I shall be all the more\nhonoured, as I have faced greater dangers than the knights-errant of\nyore exposed themselves to.\"",

            "text": "My family had its origin in a village in the mountains of Leon, and\nnature had been kinder and more generous to it than fortune; though in\nthe general poverty of those communities my father passed for being\neven a rich man; and he would have been so in reality had he been as\nclever in preserving his property as he was in spending it. This\ntendency of his to be liberal and profuse he had acquired from having\nbeen a soldier in his youth, for the soldier's life is a school in\nwhich the niggard becomes free-handed and the free-handed prodigal; and\nif any soldiers are to be found who are misers, they are monsters of\nrare occurrence. My father went beyond liberality and bordered on\nprodigality, a disposition by no means advantageous to a married man\nwho has children to succeed to his name and position. My father had\nthree, all sons, and all of sufficient age to make choice of a\nprofession. Finding, then, that he was unable to resist his propensity,\nhe resolved to divest himself of the instrument and cause of his\nprodigality and lavishness, to divest himself of wealth, without which\nAlexander himself would have seemed parsimonious; and so calling us all\nthree aside one day into a room, he addressed us in words somewhat to\nthe following effect:\n\"My sons, to assure you that I love you, no more need be known or said\nthan that you are my sons; and to encourage a suspicion that I do not\nlove you, no more is needed than the knowledge that I have no\nself-control as far as preservation of your patrimony is concerned;\ntherefore, that you may for the future feel sure that I love you like a\nfather, and have no wish to ruin you like a stepfather, I propose to do\nwith you what I have for some time back meditated, and after mature\ndeliberation decided upon. You are now of an age to choose your line of\nlife or at least make choice of a calling that will bring you honour\nand profit when you are older; and what I have resolved to do is to\ndivide my property into four parts; three I will give to you, to each\nhis portion without making any difference, and the other I will retain\nto live upon and support myself for whatever remainder of life Heaven\nmay be pleased to grant me. But I wish each of you on taking possession\nof the share that falls to him to follow one of the paths I shall\nindicate. In this Spain of ours there is a proverb, to my mind very\ntrue\u2014as they all are, being short aphorisms drawn from long practical\nexperience\u2014and the one I refer to says, 'The church, or the sea, or the\nking's house;' as much as to say, in plainer language, whoever wants to\nflourish and become rich, let him follow the church, or go to sea,\nadopting commerce as his calling, or go into the king's service in his\nhousehold, for they say, 'Better a king's crumb than a lord's favour.'\nI say so because it is my will and pleasure that one of you should\nfollow letters, another trade, and the third serve the king in the\nwars, for it is a difficult matter to gain admission to his service in\nhis household, and if war does not bring much wealth it confers great\ndistinction and fame. Eight days hence I will give you your full shares\nin money, without defrauding you of a farthing, as you will see in the\nend. Now tell me if you are willing to follow out my idea and advice as\nI have laid it before you.\"",

My\ntwo brothers, moved by my example, gave him each a thousand ducats, so\nthat there was left for my father four thousand ducats in money,\nbesides three thousand, the value of the portion that fell to him which\nhe preferred to retain in land instead of selling it. Finally, as I\nsaid, we took leave of him, and of our uncle whom I have mentioned, not\nwithout sorrow and tears on both sides, they charging us to let them\nknow whenever an opportunity offered how we fared, whether well or ill.\nWe promised to do so, and when he had embraced us and given us his\nblessing, one set out for Salamanca, the other for Seville, and I for\nAlicante, where I had heard there was a Genoese vessel taking in a\ncargo of wool for Genoa.",

I embarked at Alicante, reached Genoa after\na prosperous voyage, and proceeded thence to Milan, where I provided\nmyself with arms and a few soldier's accoutrements; thence it was my\nintention to go and take service in Piedmont, but as I was already on\nthe road to Alessandria della Paglia, I learned that the great Duke of\nAlva was on his way to Flanders. I changed my plans, joined him, served\nunder him in the campaigns he made, was present at the deaths of the\nCounts Egmont and Horn, and was promoted to be ensign under a famous\ncaptain of Guadalajara, Diego de Urbina by name. Some time after my\narrival in Flanders news came of the league that his Holiness Pope Pius\nV. of happy memory, had made with Venice and Spain against the common\nenemy, the Turk, who had just then with his fleet taken the famous\nisland of Cyprus, which belonged to the Venetians, a loss deplorable\nand disastrous. It was known as a fact that the Most Serene Don John of\nAustria, natural brother of our good king Don Philip, was coming as\ncommander-in-chief of the allied forces, and rumours were abroad of the\nvast warlike preparations which were being made, all which stirred my\nheart and filled me with a longing to take part in the campaign which\nwas expected; and though I had reason to believe, and almost certain\npromises, that on the first opportunity that presented itself I should\nbe promoted to be captain, I preferred to leave all and betake myself,\nas I did, to Italy; and it was my good fortune that Don John had just\narrived at Genoa, and was going on to Naples to join the Venetian\nfleet, as he afterwards did at Messina. I may say, in short, that I\ntook part in that glorious expedition, promoted by this time to be a\ncaptain of infantry, to which honourable charge my good luck rather\nthan my merits raised me; and that day\u2014so fortunate for Christendom,\nbecause then all the nations of the earth were disabused of the error\nunder which they lay in imagining the Turks to be invincible on sea\u2014on\nthat day, I say, on which the Ottoman pride and arrogance were broken,\namong all that were there made happy (for the Christians who died that\nday were happier than those who remained alive and victorious) I alone\nwas miserable; for, instead of some naval crown that I might have\nexpected had it been in Roman times, on the night that followed that\nfamous day I found myself with fetters on my feet and manacles on my\nhands.",

            "text": "It happened in this way: El Uchali, the king of Algiers, a daring and\nsuccessful corsair, having attacked and taken the leading Maltese\ngalley (only three knights being left alive in it, and they badly\nwounded), the chief galley of John Andrea, on board of which I and my\ncompany were placed, came to its relief, and doing as was bound to do\nin such a case, I leaped on board the enemy's galley, which, sheering\noff from that which had attacked it, prevented my men from following\nme, and so I found myself alone in the midst of my enemies, who were in\nsuch numbers that I was unable to resist; in short I was taken, covered\nwith wounds; El Uchali, as you know, sirs, made his escape with his\nentire squadron, and I was left a prisoner in his power, the only sad\nbeing among so many filled with joy, and the only captive among so many\nfree; for there were fifteen thousand Christians, all at the oar in the\nTurkish fleet, that regained their longed-for liberty that day.\nThey carried me to Constantinople, where the Grand Turk, Selim, made my\nmaster general at sea for having done his duty in the battle and\ncarried off as evidence of his bravery the standard of the Order of\nMalta. The following year, which was the year seventy-two, I found\nmyself at Navarino rowing in the leading galley with the three\nlanterns. There I saw and observed how the opportunity of capturing the\nwhole Turkish fleet in harbour was lost; for all the marines and\njanizzaries that belonged to it made sure that they were about to be\nattacked inside the very harbour, and had their kits and pasamaques, or\nshoes, ready to flee at once on shore without waiting to be assailed,\nin so great fear did they stand of our fleet. But Heaven ordered it\notherwise, not for any fault or neglect of the general who commanded on\nour side, but for the sins of Christendom, and because it was God's\nwill and pleasure that we should always have instruments of punishment\nto chastise us. As it was, El Uchali took refuge at Modon, which is an\nisland near Navarino, and landing forces fortified the mouth of the\nharbour and waited quietly until Don John retired. On this expedition\nwas taken the galley called the Prize, whose captain was a son of the\nfamous corsair Barbarossa. It was taken by the chief Neapolitan galley\ncalled the She-wolf, commanded by that thunderbolt of war, that father\nof his men, that successful and unconquered captain Don \u00c1lvaro de\nBazan, Marquis of Santa Cruz; and I cannot help telling you what took\nplace at the capture of the Prize.\nThe son of Barbarossa was so cruel, and treated his slaves so badly,\nthat, when those who were at the oars saw that the She-wolf galley was\nbearing down upon them and gaining upon them, they all at once dropped\ntheir oars and seized their captain who stood on the stage at the end\nof the gangway shouting to them to row lustily; and passing him on from\nbench to bench, from the poop to the prow, they so bit him that before\nhe had got much past the mast his soul had already got to hell; so\ngreat, as I said, was the cruelty with which he treated them, and the\nhatred with which they hated him.\nWe returned to Constantinople, and the following year, seventy-three,\nit became known that Don John had seized Tunis and taken the kingdom\nfrom the Turks, and placed Muley Hamet in possession, putting an end to\nthe hopes which Muley Hamida, the cruelest and bravest Moor in the\nworld, entertained of returning to reign there. The Grand Turk took the\nloss greatly to heart, and with the cunning which all his race possess,\nhe made peace with the Venetians (who were much more eager for it than\nhe was), and the following year, seventy-four, he attacked the Goletta\nand the fort which Don John had left half built near Tunis. While all\nthese events were occurring, I was labouring at the oar without any\nhope of freedom; at least I had no hope of obtaining it by ransom, for\nI was firmly resolved not to write to my father telling him of my\nmisfortunes. At length the Goletta fell, and the fort fell, before\nwhich places there were seventy-five thousand regular Turkish soldiers,\nand more than four hundred thousand Moors and Arabs from all parts of\nAfrica, and in the train of all this great host such munitions and\nengines of war, and so many pioneers that with their hands they might\nhave covered the Goletta and the fort with handfuls of earth. The first\nto fall was the Goletta, until then reckoned impregnable, and it fell,\nnot by any fault of its defenders, who did all that they could and\nshould have done, but because experiment proved how easily\nentrenchments could be made in the desert sand there; for water used to\nbe found at two palms depth, while the Turks found none at two yards;\nand so by means of a quantity of sandbags they raised their works so\nhigh that they commanded the walls of the fort, sweeping them as if\nfrom a cavalier, so that no one was able to make a stand or maintain\nthe defence.\nIt was a common opinion that our men should not have shut themselves up\nin the Goletta, but should have waited in the open at the\nlanding-place; but those who say so talk at random and with little\nknowledge of such matters; for if in the Goletta and in the fort there\nwere barely seven thousand soldiers, how could such a small number,\nhowever resolute, sally out and hold their own against numbers like\nthose of the enemy? And how is it possible to help losing a stronghold\nthat is not relieved, above all when surrounded by a host of determined\nenemies in their own country? But many thought, and I thought so too,\nthat it was special favour and mercy which Heaven showed to Spain in\npermitting the destruction of that source and hiding place of mischief,\nthat devourer, sponge, and moth of countless money, fruitlessly wasted\nthere to no other purpose save preserving the memory of its capture by\nthe invincible Charles V.; as if to make that eternal, as it is and\nwill be, these stones were needed to support it. The fort also fell;\nbut the Turks had to win it inch by inch, for the soldiers who defended\nit fought so gallantly and stoutly that the number of the enemy killed\nin twenty-two general assaults exceeded twenty-five thousand. Of three\nhundred that remained alive not one was taken unwounded, a clear and\nmanifest proof of their gallantry and resolution, and how sturdily they\nhad defended themselves and held their post. A small fort or tower\nwhich was in the middle of the lagoon under the command of Don Juan\nZanoguera, a Valencian gentleman and a famous soldier, capitulated upon\nterms. They took prisoner Don Pedro Puertocarrero, commandant of the\nGoletta, who had done all in his power to defend his fortress, and took\nthe loss of it so much to heart that he died of grief on the way to\nConstantinople, where they were carrying him a prisoner. They also took\nthe commandant of the fort, Gabrio Cerbellon by name, a Milanese\ngentleman, a great engineer and a very brave soldier. In these two\nfortresses perished many persons of note, among whom was Pagano Doria,\nknight of the Order of St. John, a man of generous disposition, as was\nshown by his extreme liberality to his brother, the famous John Andrea\nDoria; and what made his death the more sad was that he was slain by\nsome Arabs to whom, seeing that the fort was now lost, he entrusted\nhimself, and who offered to conduct him in the disguise of a Moor to\nTabarca, a small fort or station on the coast held by the Genoese\nemployed in the coral fishery. These Arabs cut off his head and carried\nit to the commander of the Turkish fleet, who proved on them the truth\nof our Castilian proverb, that \"though the treason may please, the\ntraitor is hated;\" for they say he ordered those who brought him the\npresent to be hanged for not having brought him alive.",

Finally the fleet returned victorious and triumphant to\nConstantinople, and a few months later died my master, El Uchali,\notherwise Uchali Fartax, which means in Turkish \"the scabby renegade;\"\nfor that he was; it is the practice with the Turks to name people from\nsome defect or virtue they may possess; the reason being that there are\namong them only four surnames belonging to families tracing their\ndescent from the Ottoman house, and the others, as I have said, take\ntheir names and surnames either from bodily blemishes or moral\nqualities. This \"scabby one\" rowed at the oar as a slave of the Grand\nSignor's for fourteen years, and when over thirty-four years of age, in\nresentment at having been struck by a Turk while at the oar, turned\nrenegade and renounced his faith in order to be able to revenge\nhimself; and such was his valour that, without owing his advancement to\nthe base ways and means by which most favourites of the Grand Signor\nrise to power, he came to be king of Algiers, and afterwards\ngeneral-on-sea, which is the third place of trust in the realm. He was\na Calabrian by birth, and a worthy man morally, and he treated his\nslaves with great humanity. He had three thousand of them, and after\nhis death they were divided, as he directed by his will, between the\nGrand Signor (who is heir of all who die and shares with the children\nof the deceased) and his renegades. I fell to the lot of a Venetian\nrenegade who, when a cabin boy on board a ship, had been taken by\nUchali and was so much beloved by him that he became one of his most\nfavoured youths. He came to be the most cruel renegade I ever saw: his\nname was Hassan Aga, and he grew very rich and became king of Algiers.",

            "text": "To go on with my story; the courtyard of our prison was overlooked by\nthe windows of the house belonging to a wealthy Moor of high position;\nand these, as is usual in Moorish houses, were rather loopholes than\nwindows, and besides were covered with thick and close lattice-work. It\nso happened, then, that as I was one day on the terrace of our prison\nwith three other comrades, trying, to pass away the time, how far we\ncould leap with our chains, we being alone, for all the other\nChristians had gone out to work, I chanced to raise my eyes, and from\none of these little closed windows I saw a reed appear with a cloth\nattached to the end of it, and it kept waving to and fro, and moving as\nif making signs to us to come and take it. We watched it, and one of\nthose who were with me went and stood under the reed to see whether\nthey would let it drop, or what they would do, but as he did so the\nreed was raised and moved from side to side, as if they meant to say\n\"no\" by a shake of the head. The Christian came back, and it was again\nlowered, making the same movements as before. Another of my comrades\nwent, and with him the same happened as with the first, and then the\nthird went forward, but with the same result as the first and second.\nSeeing this I did not like not to try my luck, and as soon as I came\nunder the reed it was dropped and fell inside the ba\u00f1o at my feet. I\nhastened to untie the cloth, in which I perceived a knot, and in this\nwere ten cianis, which are coins of base gold, current among the Moors,\nand each worth ten reals of our money.\nIt is needless to say I rejoiced over this godsend, and my joy was not\nless than my wonder as I strove to imagine how this good fortune could\nhave come to us, but to me specially; for the evident unwillingness to\ndrop the reed for any but me showed that it was for me the favour was\nintended. I took my welcome money, broke the reed, and returned to the\nterrace, and looking up at the window, I saw a very white hand put out\nthat opened and shut very quickly. From this we gathered or fancied\nthat it must be some woman living in that house that had done us this\nkindness, and to show that we were grateful for it, we made salaams\nafter the fashion of the Moors, bowing the head, bending the body, and\ncrossing the arms on the breast. Shortly afterwards at the same window\na small cross made of reeds was put out and immediately withdrawn. This\nsign led us to believe that some Christian woman was a captive in the\nhouse, and that it was she who had been so good to us; but the\nwhiteness of the hand and the bracelets we had perceived made us\ndismiss that idea, though we thought it might be one of the Christian\nrenegades whom their masters very often take as lawful wives, and\ngladly, for they prefer them to the women of their own nation. In all\nour conjectures we were wide of the truth; so from that time forward\nour sole occupation was watching and gazing at the window where the\ncross had appeared to us, as if it were our pole-star; but at least\nfifteen days passed without our seeing either it or the hand, or any",

            "text": "c40b.jpg (288K)\nFull Size\nWe made trial as before, each of the same three going forward before I\ndid; but the reed was delivered to none but me, and on my approach it\nwas let drop. I untied the knot and I found forty Spanish gold crowns\nwith a paper written in Arabic, and at the end of the writing there was\na large cross drawn. I kissed the cross, took the crowns and returned\nto the terrace, and we all made our salaams; again the hand appeared, I\nmade signs that I would read the paper, and then the window was closed.\nWe were all puzzled, though filled with joy at what had taken place;\nand as none of us understood Arabic, great was our curiosity to know\nwhat the paper contained, and still greater the difficulty of finding\nsomeone to read it. At last I resolved to confide in a renegade, a\nnative of Murcia, who professed a very great friendship for me, and had\ngiven pledges that bound him to keep any secret I might entrust to him;\nfor it is the custom with some renegades, when they intend to return to\nChristian territory, to carry about them certificates from captives of\nmark testifying, in whatever form they can, that such and such a\nrenegade is a worthy man who has always shown kindness to Christians,\nand is anxious to escape on the first opportunity that may present\nitself. Some obtain these testimonials with good intentions, others put\nthem to a cunning use; for when they go to pillage on Christian\nterritory, if they chance to be cast away, or taken prisoners, they\nproduce their certificates and say that from these papers may be seen\nthe object they came for, which was to remain on Christian ground, and\nthat it was to this end they joined the Turks in their foray. In this\nway they escape the consequences of the first outburst and make their\npeace with the Church before it does them any harm, and then when they\nhave the chance they return to Barbary to become what they were before.\nOthers, however, there are who procure these papers and make use of\nthem honestly, and remain on Christian soil. This friend of mine, then,\nwas one of these renegades that I have described; he had certificates\nfrom all our comrades, in which we testified in his favour as strongly\nas we could; and if the Moors had found the papers they would have\nburned him alive.\nI knew that he understood Arabic very well, and could not only speak\nbut also write it; but before I disclosed the whole matter to him, I\nasked him to read for me this paper which I had found by accident in a\nhole in my cell. He opened it and remained some time examining it and\nmuttering to himself as he translated it. I asked him if he understood\nit, and he told me he did perfectly well, and that if I wished him to\ntell me its meaning word for word, I must give him pen and ink that he\nmight do it more satisfactorily. We at once gave him what he required,\nand he set about translating it bit by bit, and when he had done he\nsaid:\n\"All that is here in Spanish is what the Moorish paper contains, and\nyou must bear in mind that when it says 'Lela Marien' it means 'Our\nLady the Virgin Mary.'\"\nWe read the paper and it ran thus:\n\"When I was a child my father had a slave who taught me to pray the\nChristian prayer in my own language, and told me many things about Lela\nMarien. The Christian died, and I know that she did not go to the fire,\nbut to Allah, because since then I have seen her twice, and she told me\nto go to the land of the Christians to see Lela Marien, who had great\nlove for me. I know not how to go. I have seen many Christians, but\nexcept thyself none has seemed to me to be a gentleman. I am young and\nbeautiful, and have plenty of money to take with me. See if thou canst\ncontrive how we may go, and if thou wilt thou shalt be my husband\nthere, and if thou wilt not it will not distress me, for Lela Marien\nwill find me someone to marry me. I myself have written this: have a\ncare to whom thou givest it to read: trust no Moor, for they are all\nperfidious. I am greatly troubled on this account, for I would not have\nthee confide in anyone, because if my father knew it he would at once\nfling me down a well and cover me with stones. I will put a thread to\nthe reed; tie the answer to it, and if thou hast no one to write for\nthee in Arabic, tell it to me by signs, for Lela Marien will make me\nunderstand thee. She and Allah and this cross, which I often kiss as\nthe captive bade me, protect thee.\"\nJudge, sirs, whether we had reason for surprise and joy at the words of\nthis paper; and both one and the other were so great, that the renegade\nperceived that the paper had not been found by chance, but had been in\nreality addressed to someone of us, and he begged us, if what he\nsuspected were the truth, to trust him and tell him all, for he would\nrisk his life for our freedom; and so saying he took out from his\nbreast a metal crucifix, and with many tears swore by the God the image\nrepresented, in whom, sinful and wicked as he was, he truly and\nfaithfully believed, to be loyal to us and keep secret whatever we\nchose to reveal to him; for he thought and almost foresaw that by means\nof her who had written that paper, he and all of us would obtain our\nliberty, and he himself obtain the object he so much desired, his\nrestoration to the bosom of the Holy Mother Church, from which by his\nown sin and ignorance he was now severed like a corrupt limb. The\nrenegade said this with so many tears and such signs of repentance,\nthat with one consent we all agreed to tell him the whole truth of the\nmatter, and so we gave him a full account of all, without hiding\nanything from him. We pointed out to him the window at which the reed\nappeared, and he by that means took note of the house, and resolved to\nascertain with particular care who lived in it. We agreed also that it\nwould be advisable to answer the Moorish lady's letter, and the\nrenegade without a moment's delay took down the words I dictated to\nhim, which were exactly what I shall tell you, for nothing of\nimportance that took place in this affair has escaped my memory, or\never will while life lasts. This, then, was the answer returned to the\nMoorish lady:\n\"The true Allah protect thee, Lady, and that blessed Marien who is the\ntrue mother of God, and who has put it into thy heart to go to the land\nof the Christians, because she loves thee. Entreat her that she be\npleased to show thee how thou canst execute the command she gives thee,\nfor she will, such is her goodness. On my own part, and on that of all\nthese Christians who are with me, I promise to do all that we can for\nthee, even to death. Fail not to write to me and inform me what thou\ndost mean to do, and I will always answer thee; for the great Allah has\ngiven us a Christian captive who can speak and write thy language well,\nas thou mayest see by this paper; without fear, therefore, thou canst\ninform us of all thou wouldst. As to what thou sayest, that if thou\ndost reach the land of the Christians thou wilt be my wife, I give thee\nmy promise upon it as a good Christian; and know that the Christians\nkeep their promises better than the Moors. Allah and Marien his mother\nwatch over thee, my Lady.\"\nThe paper being written and folded I waited two days until the ba\u00f1o was\nempty as before, and immediately repaired to the usual walk on the\nterrace to see if there were any sign of the reed, which was not long\nin making its appearance. As soon as I saw it, although I could not\ndistinguish who put it out, I showed the paper as a sign to attach the\nthread, but it was already fixed to the reed, and to it I tied the\npaper; and shortly afterwards our star once more made its appearance\nwith the white flag of peace, the little bundle. It was dropped, and I\npicked it up, and found in the cloth, in gold and silver coins of all\nsorts, more than fifty crowns, which fifty times more strengthened our\njoy and doubled our hope of gaining our liberty. That very night our\nrenegade returned and said he had learned that the Moor we had been\ntold of lived in that house, that his name was Hadji Morato, that he\nwas enormously rich, that he had one only daughter the heiress of all\nhis wealth, and that it was the general opinion throughout the city\nthat she was the most beautiful woman in Barbary, and that several of\nthe viceroys who came there had sought her for a wife, but that she had\nbeen always unwilling to marry; and he had learned, moreover, that she\nhad a Christian slave who was now dead; all which agreed with the\ncontents of the paper. We immediately took counsel with the renegade as\nto what means would have to be adopted in order to carry off the\nMoorish lady and bring us all to Christian territory; and in the end it\nwas agreed that for the present we should wait for a second\ncommunication from Zoraida (for that was the name of her who now\ndesires to be called Maria), because we saw clearly that she and no one\nelse could find a way out of all these difficulties. When we had\ndecided upon this the renegade told us not to be uneasy, for he would\nlose his life or restore us to liberty. For four days the ba\u00f1o was\nfilled with people, for which reason the reed delayed its appearance\nfor four days, but at the end of that time, when the ba\u00f1o was, as it\ngenerally was, empty, it appeared with the cloth so bulky that it\npromised a happy birth. Reed and cloth came down to me, and I found\nanother paper and a hundred crowns in gold, without any other coin. The\nrenegade was present, and in our cell we gave him the paper to read,\nwhich was to this effect:\n\"I cannot think of a plan, se\u00f1or, for our going to Spain, nor has Lela\nMarien shown me one, though I have asked her. All that can be done is\nfor me to give you plenty of money in gold from this window. With it\nransom yourself and your friends, and let one of you go to the land of\nthe Christians, and there buy a vessel and come back for the others;\nand he will find me in my father's garden, which is at the Babazon gate\nnear the seashore, where I shall be all this summer with my father and\nmy servants. You can carry me away from there by night without any\ndanger, and bring me to the vessel. And remember thou art to be my\nhusband, else I will pray to Marien to punish thee. If thou canst not\ntrust anyone to go for the vessel, ransom thyself and do thou go, for I\nknow thou wilt return more surely than any other, as thou art a\ngentleman and a Christian. Endeavour to make thyself acquainted with\nthe garden; and when I see thee walking yonder I shall know that the\nba\u00f1o is empty and I will give thee abundance of money. Allah protect\nthee, se\u00f1or.\"",

            "text": "These were the words and contents of the second paper, and on hearing\nthem, each declared himself willing to be the ransomed one, and\npromised to go and return with scrupulous good faith; and I too made\nthe same offer; but to all this the renegade objected, saying that he\nwould not on any account consent to one being set free before all went\ntogether, as experience had taught him how ill those who have been set\nfree keep promises which they made in captivity; for captives of\ndistinction frequently had recourse to this plan, paying the ransom of\none who was to go to Valencia or Majorca with money to enable him to\narm a bark and return for the others who had ransomed him, but who\nnever came back; for recovered liberty and the dread of losing it again\nefface from the memory all the obligations in the world. And to prove\nthe truth of what he said, he told us briefly what had happened to a\ncertain Christian gentleman almost at that very time, the strangest\ncase that had ever occurred even there, where astonishing and\nmarvellous things are happening every instant. In short, he ended by\nsaying that what could and ought to be done was to give the money\nintended for the ransom of one of us Christians to him, so that he\nmight with it buy a vessel there in Algiers under the pretence of\nbecoming a merchant and trader at Tetuan and along the coast; and when\nmaster of the vessel, it would be easy for him to hit on some way of\ngetting us all out of the ba\u00f1o and putting us on board; especially if\nthe Moorish lady gave, as she said, money enough to ransom all, because\nonce free it would be the easiest thing in the world for us to embark\neven in open day; but the greatest difficulty was that the Moors do not\nallow any renegade to buy or own any craft, unless it be a large vessel\nfor going on roving expeditions, because they are afraid that anyone\nwho buys a small vessel, especially if he be a Spaniard, only wants it\nfor the purpose of escaping to Christian territory. This however he\ncould get over by arranging with a Tagarin Moor to go shares with him\nin the purchase of the vessel, and in the profit on the cargo; and\nunder cover of this he could become master of the vessel, in which case\nhe looked upon all the rest as accomplished. But though to me and my\ncomrades it had seemed a better plan to send to Majorca for the vessel,\nas the Moorish lady suggested, we did not dare to oppose him, fearing\nthat if we did not do as he said he would denounce us, and place us in\ndanger of losing all our lives if he were to disclose our dealings with\nZoraida, for whose life we would have all given our own. We therefore\nresolved to put ourselves in the hands of God and in the renegade's;\nand at the same time an answer was given to Zoraida, telling her that\nwe would do all she recommended, for she had given as good advice as if\nLela Marien had delivered it, and that it depended on her alone whether\nwe were to defer the business or put it in execution at once. I renewed\nmy promise to be her husband; and thus the next day that the ba\u00f1o\nchanced to be empty she at different times gave us by means of the reed\nand cloth two thousand gold crowns and a paper in which she said that\nthe next Juma, that is to say Friday, she was going to her father's\ngarden, but that before she went she would give us more money; and if\nit were not enough we were to let her know, as she would give us as\nmuch as we asked, for her father had so much he would not miss it, and\nbesides she kept all the keys.\nWe at once gave the renegade five hundred crowns to buy the vessel, and\nwith eight hundred I ransomed myself, giving the money to a Valencian\nmerchant who happened to be in Algiers at the time, and who had me\nreleased on his word, pledging it that on the arrival of the first ship\nfrom Valencia he would pay my ransom; for if he had given the money at\nonce it would have made the king suspect that my ransom money had been\nfor a long time in Algiers, and that the merchant had for his own\nadvantage kept it secret. In fact my master was so difficult to deal\nwith that I dared not on any account pay down the money at once. The\nThursday before the Friday on which the fair Zoraida was to go to the\ngarden she gave us a thousand crowns more, and warned us of her\ndeparture, begging me, if I were ransomed, to find out her father's\ngarden at once, and by all means to seek an opportunity of going there\nto see her. I answered in a few words that I would do so, and that she\nmust remember to commend us to Lela Marien with all the prayers the\ncaptive had taught her. This having been done, steps were taken to\nransom our three comrades, so as to enable them to quit the ba\u00f1o, and\nlest, seeing me ransomed and themselves not, though the money was\nforthcoming, they should make a disturbance about it and the devil\nshould prompt them to do something that might injure Zoraida; for\nthough their position might be sufficient to relieve me from this\napprehension, nevertheless I was unwilling to run any risk in the\nmatter; and so I had them ransomed in the same way as I was, handing\nover all the money to the merchant so that he might with safety and\nconfidence give security; without, however, confiding our arrangement\nand secret to him, which might have been dangerous.\nc40e.jpg (34K)",

            "text": "Before fifteen days were over our renegade had already purchased an\nexcellent vessel with room for more than thirty persons; and to make\nthe transaction safe and lend a colour to it, he thought it well to\nmake, as he did, a voyage to a place called Shershel, twenty leagues\nfrom Algiers on the Oran side, where there is an extensive trade in\ndried figs. Two or three times he made this voyage in company with the\nTagarin already mentioned. The Moors of Aragon are called Tagarins in\nBarbary, and those of Granada Mud\u00e9jares; but in the Kingdom of Fez they\ncall the Mud\u00e9jares Elches, and they are the people the king chiefly\nemploys in war. To proceed: every time he passed with his vessel he\nanchored in a cove that was not two crossbow shots from the garden\nwhere Zoraida was waiting; and there the renegade, together with the\ntwo Moorish lads that rowed, used purposely to station himself, either\ngoing through his prayers, or else practising as a part what he meant\nto perform in earnest. And thus he would go to Zoraida's garden and ask\nfor fruit, which her father gave him, not knowing him; but though, as\nhe afterwards told me, he sought to speak to Zoraida, and tell her who\nhe was, and that by my orders he was to take her to the land of the\nChristians, so that she might feel satisfied and easy, he had never\nbeen able to do so; for the Moorish women do not allow themselves to be\nseen by any Moor or Turk, unless their husband or father bid them: with\nChristian captives they permit freedom of intercourse and\ncommunication, even more than might be considered proper. But for my\npart I should have been sorry if he had spoken to her, for perhaps it\nmight have alarmed her to find her affairs talked of by renegades. But\nGod, who ordered it otherwise, afforded no opportunity for our\nrenegade's well-meant purpose; and he, seeing how safely he could go to\nShershel and return, and anchor when and how and where he liked, and\nthat the Tagarin his partner had no will but his, and that, now I was\nransomed, all we wanted was to find some Christians to row, told me to\nlook out for any I should be willing to take with me, over and above\nthose who had been ransomed, and to engage them for the next Friday,\nwhich he fixed upon for our departure. On this I spoke to twelve\nSpaniards, all stout rowers, and such as could most easily leave the\ncity; but it was no easy matter to find so many just then, because\nthere were twenty ships out on a cruise and they had taken all the\nrowers with them; and these would not have been found were it not that\ntheir master remained at home that summer without going to sea in order\nto finish a galliot that he had upon the stocks. To these men I said\nnothing more than that the next Friday in the evening they were to come\nout stealthily one by one and hang about Hadji Morato's garden, waiting\nfor me there until I came. These directions I gave each one separately,\nwith orders that if they saw any other Christians there they were not\nto say anything to them except that I had directed them to wait at that\nspot.",

            "text": "This preliminary having been settled, another still more necessary step\nhad to be taken, which was to let Zoraida know how matters stood that\nshe might be prepared and forewarned, so as not to be taken by surprise\nif we were suddenly to seize upon her before she thought the\nChristians' vessel could have returned. I determined, therefore, to go\nto the garden and try if I could speak to her; and the day before my\ndeparture I went there under the pretence of gathering herbs. The first\nperson I met was her father, who addressed me in the language that all\nover Barbary and even in Constantinople is the medium between captives\nand Moors, and is neither Morisco nor Castilian, nor of any other\nnation, but a mixture of all languages, by means of which we can all\nunderstand one another. In this sort of language, I say, he asked me\nwhat I wanted in his garden, and to whom I belonged. I replied that I\nwas a slave of the Arnaut Mami (for I knew as a certainty that he was a\nvery great friend of his), and that I wanted some herbs to make a\nsalad. He asked me then whether I were on ransom or not, and what my\nmaster demanded for me. While these questions and answers were\nproceeding, the fair Zoraida, who had already perceived me some time\nbefore, came out of the house in the garden, and as Moorish women are\nby no means particular about letting themselves be seen by Christians,\nor, as I have said before, at all coy, she had no hesitation in coming\nto where her father stood with me; moreover her father, seeing her\napproaching slowly, called to her to come. It would be beyond my power\nnow to describe to you the great beauty, the high-bred air, the\nbrilliant attire of my beloved Zoraida as she presented herself before\nmy eyes. I will content myself with saying that more pearls hung from\nher fair neck, her ears, and her hair than she had hairs on her head.\nOn her ankles, which as is customary were bare, she had carcajes (for\nso bracelets or anklets are called in Morisco) of the purest gold, set\nwith so many diamonds that she told me afterwards her father valued\nthem at ten thousand doubloons, and those she had on her wrists were\nworth as much more. The pearls were in profusion and very fine, for the\nhighest display and adornment of the Moorish women is decking\nthemselves with rich pearls and seed-pearls; and of these there are\ntherefore more among the Moors than among any other people. Zoraida's\nfather had to the reputation of possessing a great number, and the\npurest in all Algiers, and of possessing also more than two hundred\nthousand Spanish crowns; and she, who is now mistress of me only, was\nmistress of all this. Whether thus adorned she would have been\nbeautiful or not, and what she must have been in her prosperity, may be\nimagined from the beauty remaining to her after so many hardships; for,\nas everyone knows, the beauty of some women has its times and its\nseasons, and is increased or diminished by chance causes; and naturally\nthe emotions of the mind will heighten or impair it, though indeed more\nfrequently they totally destroy it. In a word she presented herself\nbefore me that day attired with the utmost splendour, and supremely\nbeautiful; at any rate, she seemed to me the most beautiful object I\nhad ever seen; and when, besides, I thought of all I owed to her I felt\nas though I had before me some heavenly being come to earth to bring me\nrelief and happiness.\nAs she approached her father told her in his own language that I was a\ncaptive belonging to his friend the Arnaut Mami, and that I had come\nfor salad.\nShe took up the conversation, and in that mixture of tongues I have\nspoken of she asked me if I was a gentleman, and why I was not\nransomed.\nI answered that I was already ransomed, and that by the price it might\nbe seen what value my master set on me, as they had given one thousand\nfive hundred zoltanis for me; to which she replied, \"Hadst thou been my\nfather's, I can tell thee, I would not have let him part with thee for\ntwice as much, for you Christians always tell lies about yourselves and\nmake yourselves out poor to cheat the Moors.\"\n\"That may be, lady,\" said I; \"but indeed I dealt truthfully with my\nmaster, as I do and mean to do with everybody in the world.\"\n\"And when dost thou go?\" said Zoraida.\n\"To-morrow, I think,\" said I, \"for there is a vessel here from France\nwhich sails to-morrow, and I think I shall go in her.\"\n\"Would it not be better,\" said Zoraida, \"to wait for the arrival of\nships from Spain and go with them and not with the French who are not\nyour friends?\"\n\"No,\" said I; \"though if there were intelligence that a vessel were now\ncoming from Spain it is true I might, perhaps, wait for it; however, it\nis more likely I shall depart to-morrow, for the longing I feel to\nreturn to my country and to those I love is so great that it will not\nallow me to wait for another opportunity, however more convenient, if\nit be delayed.\"\n\"No doubt thou art married in thine own country,\" said Zoraida, \"and\nfor that reason thou art anxious to go and see thy wife.\"\n\"I am not married,\" I replied, \"but I have given my promise to marry on\nmy arrival there.\"\n\"And is the lady beautiful to whom thou hast given it?\" said Zoraida.\n\"So beautiful,\" said I, \"that, to describe her worthily and tell thee\nthe truth, she is very like thee.\"\nAt this her father laughed very heartily and said, \"By Allah,\nChristian, she must be very beautiful if she is like my daughter, who\nis the most beautiful woman in all this kingdom: only look at her well\nand thou wilt see I am telling the truth.\"\nZoraida's father as the better linguist helped to interpret most of\nthese words and phrases, for though she spoke the bastard language,\nthat, as I have said, is employed there, she expressed her meaning more\nby signs than by words.\nWhile we were still engaged in this conversation, a Moor came running\nup, exclaiming that four Turks had leaped over the fence or wall of the\ngarden, and were gathering the fruit though it was not yet ripe. The\nold man was alarmed and Zoraida too, for the Moors commonly, and, so to\nspeak, instinctively have a dread of the Turks, but particularly of the\nsoldiers, who are so insolent and domineering to the Moors who are\nunder their power that they treat them worse than if they were their\nslaves. Her father said to Zoraida, \"Daughter, retire into the house\nand shut thyself in while I go and speak to these dogs; and thou,\nChristian, pick thy herbs, and go in peace, and Allah bring thee safe\nto thy own country.\"\nI bowed, and he went away to look for the Turks, leaving me alone with\nZoraida, who made as if she were about to retire as her father bade\nher; but the moment he was concealed by the trees of the garden,\nturning to me with her eyes full of tears she said, \"Tameji, cristiano,\ntameji?\" that is to say, \"Art thou going, Christian, art thou going?\"\nI made answer, \"Yes, lady, but not without thee, come what may: be on\nthe watch for me on the next Juma, and be not alarmed when thou seest\nus; for most surely we shall go to the land of the Christians.\"",

To be brief, those who had gone upstairs acted so\npromptly that in an instant they came down, carrying Hadji Morato with\nhis hands bound and a napkin tied over his mouth, which prevented him\nfrom uttering a word, warning him at the same time that to attempt to\nspeak would cost him his life.

He, when he saw his daughter there, began to sigh piteously, and\nstill more when he perceived that I held her closely embraced and that\nshe lay quiet without resisting or complaining, or showing any\nreluctance; nevertheless he remained silent lest they should carry into\neffect the repeated threats the renegade had addressed to him.",

Allah\nknows that I could not do otherwise than I have done, and that these\nChristians owe nothing to my will; for even had I wished not to\naccompany them, but remain at home, it would have been impossible for\nme, so eagerly did my soul urge me on to the accomplishment of this\npurpose, which I feel to be as righteous as to thee, dear father, it\nseems wicked.\"\nBut neither could her father hear her nor we see him when she said\nthis; and so, while I consoled Zoraida, we turned our attention to our\nvoyage, in which a breeze from the right point so favoured us that we\nmade sure of finding ourselves off the coast of Spain on the morrow by\ndaybreak. But, as good seldom or never comes pure and unmixed, without\nbeing attended or followed by some disturbing evil that gives a shock\nto it, our fortune, or perhaps the curses which the Moor had hurled at\nhis daughter (for whatever kind of father they may come from these are\nalways to be dreaded), brought it about that when we were now in\nmid-sea, and the night about three hours spent, as we were running with\nall sail set and oars lashed, for the favouring breeze saved us the\ntrouble of using them, we saw by the light of the moon, which shone\nbrilliantly, a square-rigged vessel in full sail close to us, luffing\nup and standing across our course, and so close that we had to strike\nsail to avoid running foul of her, while they too put the helm hard up\nto let us pass. They came to the side of the ship to ask who we were,\nwhither we were bound, and whence we came, but as they asked this in\nFrench our renegade said, \"Let no one answer, for no doubt these are\nFrench corsairs who plunder all comers.\"\nc41f.jpg (268K)\nFull Size\nActing on this warning no one answered a word, but after we had gone a\nlittle ahead, and the vessel was now lying to leeward, suddenly they\nfired two guns, and apparently both loaded with chain-shot, for with\none they cut our mast in half and brought down both it and the sail\ninto the sea, and the other, discharged at the same moment, sent a ball\ninto our vessel amidships, staving her in completely, but without doing\nany further damage. We, however, finding ourselves sinking began to\nshout for help and call upon those in the ship to pick us up as we were\nbeginning to fill. They then lay to, and lowering a skiff or boat, as\nmany as a dozen Frenchmen, well armed with match-locks, and their\nmatches burning, got into it and came alongside; and seeing how few we\nwere, and that our vessel was going down, they took us in, telling us\nthat this had come to us through our incivility in not giving them an\nanswer. Our renegade took the trunk containing Zoraida's wealth and\ndropped it into the sea without anyone perceiving what he did. In short\nwe went on board with the Frenchmen, who, after having ascertained all\nthey wanted to know about us, rifled us of everything we had, as if\nthey had been our bitterest enemies, and from Zoraida they took even\nthe anklets she wore on her feet; but the distress they caused her did\nnot distress me so much as the fear I was in that from robbing her of\nher rich and precious jewels they would proceed to rob her of the most\nprecious jewel that she valued more than all. The desires, however, of\nthose people do not go beyond money, but of that their covetousness is\ninsatiable, and on this occasion it was carried to such a pitch that\nthey would have taken even the clothes we wore as captives if they had\nbeen worth anything to them. It was the advice of some of them to throw\nus all into the sea wrapped up in a sail; for their purpose was to\ntrade at some of the ports of Spain, giving themselves out as Bretons,\nand if they brought us alive they would be punished as soon as the\nrobbery was discovered; but the captain (who was the one who had\nplundered my beloved Zoraida) said he was satisfied with the prize he\nhad got, and that he would not touch at any Spanish port, but pass the\nStraits of Gibraltar by night, or as best he could, and make for La",

            "text": "It may have been about mid-day when they placed us in the boat, giving\nus two kegs of water and some biscuit; and the captain, moved by I know\nnot what compassion, as the lovely Zoraida was about to embark, gave\nher some forty gold crowns, and would not permit his men to take from\nher those same garments which she has on now. We got into the boat,\nreturning them thanks for their kindness to us, and showing ourselves\ngrateful rather than indignant. They stood out to sea, steering for the\nstraits; we, without looking to any compass save the land we had before\nus, set ourselves to row with such energy that by sunset we were so\nnear that we might easily, we thought, land before the night was far\nadvanced. But as the moon did not show that night, and the sky was\nclouded, and as we knew not whereabouts we were, it did not seem to us\na prudent thing to make for the shore, as several of us advised, saying\nwe ought to run ourselves ashore even if it were on rocks and far from\nany habitation, for in this way we should be relieved from the\napprehensions we naturally felt of the prowling vessels of the Tetuan\ncorsairs, who leave Barbary at nightfall and are on the Spanish coast\nby daybreak, where they commonly take some prize, and then go home to\nsleep in their own houses. But of the conflicting counsels the one\nwhich was adopted was that we should approach gradually, and land where\nwe could if the sea were calm enough to permit us. This was done, and a\nlittle before midnight we drew near to the foot of a huge and lofty\nmountain, not so close to the sea but that it left a narrow space on\nwhich to land conveniently. We ran our boat up on the sand, and all\nsprang out and kissed the ground, and with tears of joyful satisfaction\nreturned thanks to God our Lord for all his incomparable goodness to us\non our voyage. We took out of the boat the provisions it contained, and\ndrew it up on the shore, and then climbed a long way up the mountain,\nfor even there we could not feel easy in our hearts, or persuade\nourselves that it was Christian soil that was now under our feet.\nThe dawn came, more slowly, I think, than we could have wished; we\ncompleted the ascent in order to see if from the summit any habitation\nor any shepherds' huts could be discovered, but strain our eyes as we\nmight, neither dwelling, nor human being, nor path nor road could we\nperceive. However, we determined to push on farther, as it could not\nbut be that ere long we must see someone who could tell us where we\nwere. But what distressed me most was to see Zoraida going on foot over\nthat rough ground; for though I once carried her on my shoulders, she\nwas more wearied by my weariness than rested by the rest; and so she\nwould never again allow me to undergo the exertion, and went on very\npatiently and cheerfully, while I led her by the hand. We had gone\nrather less than a quarter of a league when the sound of a little bell\nfell on our ears, a clear proof that there were flocks hard by, and\nlooking about carefully to see if any were within view, we observed a\nyoung shepherd tranquilly and unsuspiciously trimming a stick with his\nknife at the foot of a cork tree. We called to him, and he, raising his\nhead, sprang nimbly to his feet, for, as we afterwards learned, the\nfirst who presented themselves to his sight were the renegade and\nZoraida, and seeing them in Moorish dress he imagined that all the\nMoors of Barbary were upon him; and plunging with marvellous swiftness\ninto the thicket in front of him, he began to raise a prodigious\noutcry, exclaiming, \"The Moors\u2014the Moors have landed! To arms, to\narms!\" We were all thrown into perplexity by these cries, not knowing\nwhat to do; but reflecting that the shouts of the shepherd would raise\nthe country and that the mounted coast-guard would come at once to see\nwhat was the matter, we agreed that the renegade must strip off his\nTurkish garments and put on a captive's jacket or coat which one of our\nparty gave him at once, though he himself was reduced to his shirt; and\nso commending ourselves to God, we followed the same road which we saw\nthe shepherd take, expecting every moment that the coast-guard would be\ndown upon us. Nor did our expectation deceive us, for two hours had not\npassed when, coming out of the brushwood into the open ground, we\nperceived some fifty mounted men swiftly approaching us at a\nhand-gallop. As soon as we saw them we stood still, waiting for them;\nbut as they came close and, instead of the Moors they were in quest of,\nsaw a set of poor Christians, they were taken aback, and one of them\nasked if it could be we who were the cause of the shepherd having\nraised the call to arms. I said \"Yes,\" and as I was about to explain to\nhim what had occurred, and whence we came and who we were, one of the\nChristians of our party recognised the horseman who had put the\nquestion to us, and before I could say anything more he exclaimed:\n\"Thanks be to God, sirs, for bringing us to such good quarters; for, if\nI do not deceive myself, the ground we stand on is that of Velez Malaga\nunless, indeed, all my years of captivity have made me unable to\nrecollect that you, se\u00f1or, who ask who we are, are Pedro de Bustamante,\nmy uncle.\"\nThe Christian captive had hardly uttered these words, when the horseman\nthrew himself off his horse, and ran to embrace the young man, crying:\n\"Nephew of my soul and life! I recognise thee now; and long have I\nmourned thee as dead, I, and my sister, thy mother, and all thy kin\nthat are still alive, and whom God has been pleased to preserve that\nthey may enjoy the happiness of seeing thee. We knew long since that\nthou wert in Algiers, and from the appearance of thy garments and those\nof all this company, I conclude that ye have had a miraculous\nrestoration to liberty.\"\n\"It is true,\" replied the young man, \"and by-and-by we will tell you\nall.\"\nAs soon as the horsemen understood that we were Christian captives,\nthey dismounted from their horses, and each offered his to carry us to\nthe city of Velez Malaga, which was a league and a half distant. Some\nof them went to bring the boat to the city, we having told them where\nwe had left it; others took us up behind them, and Zoraida was placed\non the horse of the young man's uncle. The whole town came out to meet\nus, for they had by this time heard of our arrival from one who had\ngone on in advance. They were not astonished to see liberated captives\nor captive Moors, for people on that coast are well used to see both\none and the other; but they were astonished at the beauty of Zoraida,\nwhich was just then heightened, as well by the exertion of travelling\nas by joy at finding herself on Christian soil, and relieved of all\nfear of being lost; for this had brought such a glow upon her face,\nthat unless my affection for her were deceiving me, I would venture to\nsay that there was not a more beautiful creature in the world\u2014at least,\nthat I had ever seen. We went straight to the church to return thanks\nto God for the mercies we had received, and when Zoraida entered it she\nsaid there were faces there like Lela Marien's. We told her they were\nher images; and as well as he could the renegade explained to her what\nthey meant, that she might adore them as if each of them were the very\nsame Lela Marien that had spoken to her; and she, having great\nintelligence and a quick and clear instinct, understood at once all he\nsaid to her about them. Thence they took us away and distributed us all\nin different houses in the town; but as for the renegade, Zoraida, and\nmyself, the Christian who came with us brought us to the house of his\nparents, who had a fair share of the gifts of fortune, and treated us\nwith as much kindness as they did their own son.\nWe remained six days in Velez, at the end of which the renegade, having\ninformed himself of all that was requisite for him to do, set out for\nthe city of Granada to restore himself to the sacred bosom of the\nChurch through the medium of the Holy Inquisition. The other released\ncaptives took their departures, each the way that seemed best to him,\nand Zoraida and I were left alone, with nothing more than the crowns\nwhich the courtesy of the Frenchman had bestowed upon Zoraida, out of\nwhich I bought the beast on which she rides; and, I for the present\nattending her as her father and squire and not as her husband, we are\nnow going to ascertain if my father is living, or if any of my brothers\nhas had better fortune than mine has been; though, as Heaven has made",

He led by\nthe hand a young girl in a travelling dress, apparently about sixteen\nyears of age, and of such a high-bred air, so beautiful and so\ngraceful, that all were filled with admiration when she made her\nappearance, and but for having seen Dorothea, Luscinda, and Zoraida,\nwho were there in the inn, they would have fancied that a beauty like\nthat of this maiden's would have been hard to find. Don Quixote was\npresent at the entrance of the Judge with the young lady, and as soon\nas he saw him he said, \"Your worship may with confidence enter and take\nyour ease in this castle; for though the accommodation be scanty and\npoor, there are no quarters so cramped or inconvenient that they cannot\nmake room for arms and letters; above all if arms and letters have\nbeauty for a guide and leader, as letters represented by your worship\nhave in this fair maiden, to whom not only ought castles to throw\nthemselves open and yield themselves up, but rocks should rend\nthemselves asunder and mountains divide and bow themselves down to give\nher a reception. Enter, your worship, I say, into this paradise, for\nhere you will find stars and suns to accompany the heaven your worship\nbrings with you, here you will find arms in their supreme excellence,\nand beauty in its highest perfection.\"\nThe Judge was struck with amazement at the language of Don Quixote,\nwhom he scrutinized very carefully, no less astonished by his figure\nthan by his talk; and before he could find words to answer him he had a\nfresh surprise, when he saw opposite to him Luscinda, Dorothea, and\nZoraida, who, having heard of the new guests and of the beauty of the\nyoung lady, had come to see her and welcome her; Don Fernando,\nCardenio, and the curate, however, greeted him in a more intelligible\nand polished style. In short, the Judge made his entrance in a state of\nbewilderment, as well with what he saw as what he heard, and the fair\nladies of the inn gave the fair damsel a cordial welcome. On the whole\nhe could perceive that all who were there were people of quality; but\nwith the figure, countenance, and bearing of Don Quixote he was at his\nwits' end; and all civilities having been exchanged, and the\naccommodation of the inn inquired into, it was settled, as it had been\nbefore settled, that all the women should retire to the garret that has\nbeen already mentioned, and that the men should remain outside as if to\nguard them; the Judge, therefore, was very well pleased to allow his\ndaughter, for such the damsel was, to go with the ladies, which she did\nvery willingly; and with part of the host's narrow bed and half of what\nthe Judge had brought with him, they made a more comfortable\narrangement for the night than they had expected.",

I lost mine at the Goletta,\nand after a variety of adventures we found ourselves comrades at\nConstantinople. Thence he went to Algiers, where he met with one of the\nmost extraordinary adventures that ever befell anyone in the world.\"\nHere the curate went on to relate briefly his brother's adventure with\nZoraida; to all which the Judge gave such an attentive hearing that he\nnever before had been so much of a hearer. The curate, however, only\nwent so far as to describe how the Frenchmen plundered those who were\nin the boat, and the poverty and distress in which his comrade and the\nfair Moor were left, of whom he said he had not been able to learn what\nbecame of them, or whether they had reached Spain, or been carried to\nFrance by the Frenchmen.",

That brave captain that you speak\nof is my eldest brother, who, being of a bolder and loftier mind than\nmy other brother or myself, chose the honourable and worthy calling of\narms, which was one of the three careers our father proposed to us, as\nyour comrade mentioned in that fable you thought he was telling you. I\nfollowed that of letters, in which God and my own exertions have raised\nme to the position in which you see me. My second brother is in Peru,\nso wealthy that with what he has sent to my father and to me he has\nfully repaid the portion he took with him, and has even furnished my\nfather's hands with the means of gratifying his natural generosity,\nwhile I too have been enabled to pursue my studies in a more becoming\nand creditable fashion, and so to attain my present standing. My father\nis still alive, though dying with anxiety to hear of his eldest son,\nand he prays God unceasingly that death may not close his eyes until he\nhas looked upon those of his son; but with regard to him what surprises\nme is, that having so much common sense as he had, he should have\nneglected to give any intelligence about himself, either in his\ntroubles and sufferings, or in his prosperity, for if his father or any\nof us had known of his condition he need not have waited for that\nmiracle of the reed to obtain his ransom; but what now disquiets me is\nthe uncertainty whether those Frenchmen may have restored him to\nliberty, or murdered him to hide the robbery. All this will make me\ncontinue my journey, not with the satisfaction in which I began it, but\nin the deepest melancholy and sadness. Oh dear brother! that I only\nknew where thou art now, and I would hasten to seek thee out and\ndeliver thee from thy sufferings, though it were to cost me suffering\nmyself! Oh that I could bring news to our old father that thou art\nalive, even wert thou in the deepest dungeon of Barbary; for his wealth\nand my brother's and mine would rescue thee thence! Oh beautiful and\ngenerous Zoraida, that I could repay thy goodness to a brother! That I\ncould be present at the new birth of thy soul, and at thy bridal that\nwould give us all such happiness!\"\nAll this and more the Judge uttered with such deep emotion at the news\nhe had received of his brother that all who heard him shared in it,\nshowing their sympathy with his sorrow. The curate, seeing, then, how\nwell he had succeeded in carrying out his purpose and the captain's\nwishes, had no desire to keep them unhappy any longer, so he rose from\nthe table and going into the room where Zoraida was he took her by the\nhand, Luscinda, Dorothea, and the Judge's daughter following her. The\ncaptain was waiting to see what the curate would do, when the latter,\ntaking him with the other hand, advanced with both of them to where the\nJudge and the other gentlemen were and said, \"Let your tears cease to\nflow, Se\u00f1or Judge, and the wish of your heart be gratified as fully as\nyou could desire, for you have before you your worthy brother and your\ngood sister-in-law. He whom you see here is the Captain Viedma, and\nthis is the fair Moor who has been so good to him. The Frenchmen I told\nyou of have reduced them to the state of poverty you see that you may\nshow the generosity of your kind heart.\"\nThe captain ran to embrace his brother, who placed both hands on his\nbreast so as to have a good look at him, holding him a little way off\nbut as soon as he had fully recognised him he clasped him in his arms\nso closely, shedding such tears of heartfelt joy, that most of those\npresent could not but join in them. The words the brothers exchanged,\nthe emotion they showed can scarcely be imagined, I fancy, much less\nput down in writing. They told each other in a few words the events of\ntheir lives; they showed the true affection of brothers in all its\nstrength; then the judge embraced Zoraida, putting all he possessed at\nher disposal; then he made his daughter embrace her, and the fair\nChristian and the lovely Moor drew fresh tears from every eye.

On this Clara, afraid that Luscinda might overhear\nher, winding her arms tightly round Dorothea put her mouth so close to\nher ear that she could speak without fear of being heard by anyone\nelse, and said:\n\"This singer, dear se\u00f1ora, is the son of a gentleman of Aragon, lord of\ntwo villages, who lives opposite my father's house at Madrid; and\nthough my father had curtains to the windows of his house in winter,\nand lattice-work in summer, in some way\u2014I know not how\u2014this gentleman,\nwho was pursuing his studies, saw me, whether in church or elsewhere, I\ncannot tell, and, in fact, fell in love with me, and gave me to know it\nfrom the windows of his house, with so many signs and tears that I was\nforced to believe him, and even to love him, without knowing what it\nwas he wanted of me. One of the signs he used to make me was to link\none hand in the other, to show me he wished to marry me; and though I\nshould have been glad if that could be, being alone and motherless I\nknew not whom to open my mind to, and so I left it as it was, showing\nhim no favour, except when my father, and his too, were from home, to\nraise the curtain or the lattice a little and let him see me plainly,\nat which he would show such delight that he seemed as if he were going\nmad. Meanwhile the time for my father's departure arrived, which he\nbecame aware of, but not from me, for I had never been able to tell him\nof it. He fell sick, of grief I believe, and so the day we were going\naway I could not see him to take farewell of him, were it only with the\neyes. But after we had been two days on the road, on entering the\nposada of a village a day's journey from this, I saw him at the inn\ndoor in the dress of a muleteer, and so well disguised, that if I did\nnot carry his image graven on my heart it would have been impossible\nfor me to recognise him. But I knew him, and I was surprised, and glad;\nhe watched me, unsuspected by my father, from whom he always hides\nhimself when he crosses my path on the road, or in the posadas where we\nhalt; and, as I know what he is, and reflect that for love of me he\nmakes this journey on foot in all this hardship, I am ready to die of\nsorrow; and where he sets foot there I set my eyes. I know not with\nwhat object he has come; or how he could have got away from his father,\nwho loves him beyond measure, having no other heir, and because he\ndeserves it, as you will perceive when you see him. And moreover, I can\ntell you, all that he sings is out of his own head; for I have heard\nthem say he is a great scholar and poet; and what is more, every time I\nsee him or hear him sing I tremble all over, and am terrified lest my\nfather should recognise him and come to know of our loves. I have never\nspoken a word to him in my life; and for all that I love him so that I\ncould not live without him. This, dear se\u00f1ora, is all I have to tell\nyou about the musician whose voice has delighted you so much; and from\nit alone you might easily perceive he is no muleteer, but a lord of\nhearts and towns, as I told you already.\"",

The only persons not asleep were the landlady's daughter and her\nservant Maritornes, who, knowing the weak point of Don Quixote's\nhumour, and that he was outside the inn mounting guard in armour and on\nhorseback, resolved, the pair of them, to play some trick upon him, or\nat any rate to amuse themselves for a while by listening to his\nnonsense. As it so happened there was not a window in the whole inn\nthat looked outwards except a hole in the wall of a straw-loft through\nwhich they used to throw out the straw. At this hole the two\ndemi-damsels posted themselves, and observed Don Quixote on his horse,\nleaning on his pike and from time to time sending forth such deep and\ndoleful sighs, that he seemed to pluck up his soul by the roots with\neach of them; and they could hear him, too, saying in a soft, tender,\nloving tone, \"Oh my lady Dulcinea del Toboso, perfection of all beauty,\nsummit and crown of discretion, treasure house of grace, depositary of\nvirtue, and finally, ideal of all that is good, honourable, and\ndelectable in this world! What is thy grace doing now? Art thou,\nperchance, mindful of thy enslaved knight who of his own free will hath\nexposed himself to so great perils, and all to serve thee? Give me\ntidings of her, oh luminary of the three faces! Perhaps at this moment,\nenvious of hers, thou art regarding her, either as she paces to and fro\nsome gallery of her sumptuous palaces, or leans over some balcony,\nmeditating how, whilst preserving her purity and greatness, she may\nmitigate the tortures this wretched heart of mine endures for her sake,\nwhat glory should recompense my sufferings, what repose my toil, and\nlastly what death my life, and what reward my services? And thou, oh\nsun, that art now doubtless harnessing thy steeds in haste to rise\nbetimes and come forth to see my lady; when thou seest her I entreat of\nthee to salute her on my behalf: but have a care, when thou shalt see\nher and salute her, that thou kiss not her face; for I shall be more\njealous of thee than thou wert of that light-footed ingrate that made\nthee sweat and run so on the plains of Thessaly, or on the banks of the\nPeneus (for I do not exactly recollect where it was thou didst run on\nthat occasion) in thy jealousy and love.\"\nDon Quixote had got so far in his pathetic speech when the landlady's\ndaughter began to signal to him, saying, \"Se\u00f1or, come over here,\nplease.\"\nAt these signals and voice Don Quixote turned his head and saw by the\nlight of the moon, which then was in its full splendour, that someone\nwas calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be\na window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such\nas he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately\nsuggested itself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion,\nthe fair damsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by\nlove for him, was once more endeavouring to win his affections; and\nwith this idea, not to show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he\nturned Rocinante's head and approached the hole, and as he perceived\nthe two wenches he said:\n\"I pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your\nthoughts of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a\nreturn can be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle\nbirth, for which you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom\nlove renders incapable of submission to any other than her whom, the\nfirst moment his eyes beheld her, he made absolute mistress of his\nsoul. Forgive me, noble lady, and retire to your apartment, and do not,\nby any further declaration of your passion, compel me to show myself\nmore ungrateful; and if, of the love you bear me, you should find that\nthere is anything else in my power wherein I can gratify you, provided\nit be not love itself, demand it of me; for I swear to you by that\nsweet absent enemy of mine to grant it this instant, though it be that\nyou require of me a lock of Medusa's hair, which was all snakes, or\neven the very beams of the sun shut up in a vial.\"\n\"My mistress wants nothing of that sort, sir knight,\" said Maritornes\nat this.\n\"What then, discreet dame, is it that your mistress wants?\" replied Don\nQuixote.\n\"Only one of your fair hands,\" said Maritornes, \"to enable her to vent\nover it the great passion, passion which has brought her to this\nloophole, so much to the risk of her honour; for if the lord her father\nhad heard her, the least slice he would cut off her would be her ear.\"\n\"I should like to see that tried,\" said Don Quixote; \"but he had better\nbeware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end\nthat ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender\nlimbs of a love-stricken daughter.\"\nMaritornes felt sure that Don Quixote would present the hand she had\nasked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole\nand went into the stable, where she took the halter of Sancho Panza's\nass, and in all haste returned to the hole, just as Don Quixote had\nplanted himself standing on Rocinante's saddle in order to reach the\ngrated window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving\nher his hand, he said, \"Lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of\nthe evil-doers of the earth; take, I say, this hand which no other hand\nof woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of\nmy entire body. I present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that\nyou may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the\nmuscles, the breadth and capacity of the veins, whence you may infer\nwhat must be the strength of the arm that has such a hand.\"\n\"That we shall see presently,\" said Maritornes, and making a running\nknot on the halter, she passed it over his wrist and coming down from\nthe hole tied the other end very firmly to the bolt of the door of the\nstraw-loft.\nDon Quixote, feeling the roughness of the rope on his wrist, exclaimed,\n\"Your grace seems to be grating rather than caressing my hand; treat it\nnot so harshly, for it is not to blame for the offence my resolution\nhas given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a\npart; remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so\ncruelly.\"\nBut there was nobody now to listen to these words of Don Quixote's, for\nas soon as Maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to\ndie with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was",

They called out and knocked loudly at the gate of the inn,\nwhich was still shut; on seeing which, Don Quixote, even there where he\nwas, did not forget to act as sentinel, and said in a loud and\nimperious tone, \"Knights, or squires, or whatever ye be, ye have no\nright to knock at the gates of this castle; for it is plain enough that\nthey who are within are either asleep, or else are not in the habit of\nthrowing open the fortress until the sun's rays are spread over the\nwhole surface of the earth. Withdraw to a distance, and wait till it is\nbroad daylight, and then we shall see whether it will be proper or not\nto open to you.\"\n\"What the devil fortress or castle is this,\" said one, \"to make us\nstand on such ceremony? If you are the innkeeper bid them open to us;\nwe are travellers who only want to feed our horses and go on, for we\nare in haste.\"\n\"Do you think, gentlemen, that I look like an innkeeper?\" said Don\nQuixote.\n\"I don't know what you look like,\" replied the other; \"but I know that\nyou are talking nonsense when you call this inn a castle.\"\n\"A castle it is,\" returned Don Quixote, \"nay, more, one of the best in\nthis whole province, and it has within it people who have had the\nsceptre in the hand and the crown on the head.\"\n\"It would be better if it were the other way,\" said the traveller, \"the\nsceptre on the head and the crown in the hand; but if so, maybe there\nis within some company of players, with whom it is a common thing to\nhave those crowns and sceptres you speak of; for in such a small inn as\nthis, and where such silence is kept, I do not believe any people\nentitled to crowns and sceptres can have taken up their quarters.\"\n\"You know but little of the world,\" returned Don Quixote, \"since you\nare ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry.\"\nBut the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with\nDon Quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that\nthe host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got\nup to ask who knocked. It happened at this moment that one of the\nhorses of the four who were seeking admittance went to smell Rocinante,\nwho melancholy, dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless,\nsupporting his sorely stretched master; and as he was, after all,\nflesh, though he looked as if he were made of wood, he could not help\ngiving way and in return smelling the one who had come to offer him\nattentions. But he had hardly moved at all when Don Quixote lost his\nfooting; and slipping off the saddle, he would have come to the ground,\nbut for being suspended by the arm, which caused him such agony that he\nbelieved either his wrist would be cut through or his arm torn off; and\nhe hung so near the ground that he could just touch it with his feet,\nwhich was all the worse for him; for, finding how little was wanted to\nenable him to plant his feet firmly, he struggled and stretched himself\nas much as he could to gain a footing; just like those undergoing the\ntorture of the strappado, when they are fixed at \"touch and no touch,\"\nwho aggravate their own sufferings by their violent efforts to stretch\nthemselves, deceived by the hope which makes them fancy that with a\nvery little more they will reach the ground.",

Maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same\noutcry, suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone\nseeing her, untied the halter by which Don Quixote was suspended, and\ndown he came to the ground in the sight of the landlord and the\ntravellers, who approaching asked him what was the matter with him that\nhe shouted so. He without replying a word took the rope off his wrist,\nand rising to his feet leaped upon Rocinante, braced his buckler on his\narm, put his lance in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the\nplain came back at a half-gallop exclaiming:\n\"Whoever shall say that I have been enchanted with just cause, provided\nmy lady the Princess Micomicona grants me permission to do so, I give\nhim the lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat.\"\nThe newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of Don Quixote;\nbut the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and\nnot to mind him as he was out of his senses. They then asked the\nlandlord if by any chance a youth of about fifteen years of age had\ncome to that inn, one dressed like a muleteer, and of such and such an\nappearance, describing that of Do\u00f1a Clara's lover. The landlord replied\nthat there were so many people in the inn he had not noticed the person\nthey were inquiring for; but one of them observing the coach in which\nthe Judge had come, said, \"He is here no doubt, for this is the coach\nhe is following: let one of us stay at the gate, and the rest go in to\nlook for him; or indeed it would be as well if one of us went round the\ninn, lest he should escape over the wall of the yard.\" \"So be it,\" said\nanother; and while two of them went in, one remained at the gate and\nthe other made the circuit of the inn; observing all which, the\nlandlord was unable to conjecture for what reason they were taking all\nthese precautions, though he understood they were looking for the youth\nwhose description they had given him.",

Don Quixote, when he\nsaw that not one of the four travellers took any notice of him or\nreplied to his challenge, was furious and ready to die with indignation\nand wrath; and if he could have found in the ordinances of chivalry\nthat it was lawful for a knight-errant to undertake or engage in\nanother enterprise, when he had plighted his word and faith not to\ninvolve himself in any until he had made an end of the one to which he\nwas pledged, he would have attacked the whole of them, and would have\nmade them return an answer in spite of themselves. But considering that\nit would not become him, nor be right, to begin any new emprise until\nhe had established Micomicona in her kingdom, he was constrained to\nhold his peace and wait quietly to see what would be the upshot of the\nproceedings of those same travellers; one of whom found the youth they\nwere seeking lying asleep by the side of a muleteer, without a thought\nof anyone coming in search of him, much less finding him.\nThe man laid hold of him by the arm, saying, \"It becomes you well\nindeed, Se\u00f1or Don Luis, to be in the dress you wear, and well the bed\nin which I find you agrees with the luxury in which your mother reared\nyou.\"\nThe youth rubbed his sleepy eyes and stared for a while at him who held\nhim, but presently recognised him as one of his father's servants, at\nwhich he was so taken aback that for some time he could not find or\nutter a word; while the servant went on to say, \"There is nothing for\nit now, Se\u00f1or Don Luis, but to submit quietly and return home, unless\nit is your wish that my lord, your father, should take his departure\nfor the other world, for nothing else can be the consequence of the\ngrief he is in at your absence.\"\n\"But how did my father know that I had gone this road and in this\ndress?\" said Don Luis.\n\"It was a student to whom you confided your intentions,\" answered the\nservant, \"that disclosed them, touched with pity at the distress he saw\nyour father suffer on missing you; he therefore despatched four of his\nservants in quest of you, and here we all are at your service, better\npleased than you can imagine that we shall return so soon and be able\nto restore you to those eyes that so yearn for you.\"\n\"That shall be as I please, or as heaven orders,\" returned Don Luis.\n\"What can you please or heaven order,\" said the other, \"except to agree\nto go back? Anything else is impossible.\"\nAll this conversation between the two was overheard by the muleteer at\nwhose side Don Luis lay, and rising, he went to report what had taken\nplace to Don Fernando, Cardenio, and the others, who had by this time\ndressed themselves; and told them how the man had addressed the youth\nas \"Don,\" and what words had passed, and how he wanted him to return to\nhis father, which the youth was unwilling to do. With this, and what\nthey already knew of the rare voice that heaven had bestowed upon him,\nthey all felt very anxious to know more particularly who he was, and\neven to help him if it was attempted to employ force against him; so\nthey hastened to where he was still talking and arguing with his",

The landlady and her daughter could see no one\nmore free to give aid than Don Quixote, and to him the daughter said,\n\"Sir knight, by the virtue God has given you, help my poor father, for\ntwo wicked men are beating him to a mummy.\"\nTo which Don Quixote very deliberately and phlegmatically replied,\n\"Fair damsel, at the present moment your request is inopportune, for I\nam debarred from involving myself in any adventure until I have brought\nto a happy conclusion one to which my word has pledged me; but that\nwhich I can do for you is what I will now mention: run and tell your\nfather to stand his ground as well as he can in this battle, and on no\naccount to allow himself to be vanquished, while I go and request\npermission of the Princess Micomicona to enable me to succour him in\nhis distress; and if she grants it, rest assured I will relieve him\nfrom it.\"\n\"Sinner that I am,\" exclaimed Maritornes, who stood by; \"before you\nhave got your permission my master will be in the other world.\"\n\"Give me leave, se\u00f1ora, to obtain the permission I speak of,\" returned\nDon Quixote; \"and if I get it, it will matter very little if he is in\nthe other world; for I will rescue him thence in spite of all the same\nworld can do; or at any rate I will give you such a revenge over those\nwho shall have sent him there that you will be more than moderately\nsatisfied;\" and without saying anything more he went and knelt before\nDorothea, requesting her Highness in knightly and errant phrase to be\npleased to grant him permission to aid and succour the castellan of\nthat castle, who now stood in grievous jeopardy. The princess granted\nit graciously, and he at once, bracing his buckler on his arm and\ndrawing his sword, hastened to the inn-gate, where the two guests were\nstill handling the landlord roughly; but as soon as he reached the spot\nhe stopped short and stood still, though Maritornes and the landlady\nasked him why he hesitated to help their master and husband.\n\"I hesitate,\" said Don Quixote, \"because it is not lawful for me to\ndraw sword against persons of squirely condition; but call my squire\nSancho to me; for this defence and vengeance are his affair and\nbusiness.\"\nThus matters stood at the inn-gate, where there was a very lively\nexchange of fisticuffs and punches, to the sore damage of the landlord\nand to the wrath of Maritornes, the landlady, and her daughter, who\nwere furious when they saw the pusillanimity of Don Quixote, and the\nhard treatment their master, husband and father was undergoing. But let\nus leave him there; for he will surely find someone to help him, and if\nnot, let him suffer and hold his tongue who attempts more than his\nstrength allows him to do; and let us go back fifty paces to see what",

            "text": "Don Luis said in reply to the Judge whom we left questioning him\nprivately as to his reasons for coming on foot and so meanly dressed.\nTo which the youth, pressing his hand in a way that showed his heart\nwas troubled by some great sorrow, and shedding a flood of tears, made\nanswer:\n\"Se\u00f1or, I have no more to tell you than that from the moment when,\nthrough heaven's will and our being near neighbours, I first saw Do\u00f1a\nClara, your daughter and my lady, from that instant I made her the\nmistress of my will, and if yours, my true lord and father, offers no\nimpediment, this very day she shall become my wife. For her I left my\nfather's house, and for her I assumed this disguise, to follow her\nwhithersoever she may go, as the arrow seeks its mark or the sailor the\npole-star. She knows nothing more of my passion than what she may have\nlearned from having sometimes seen from a distance that my eyes were\nfilled with tears. You know already, se\u00f1or, the wealth and noble birth\nof my parents, and that I am their sole heir; if this be a sufficient\ninducement for you to venture to make me completely happy, accept me at\nonce as your son; for if my father, influenced by other objects of his\nown, should disapprove of this happiness I have sought for myself, time\nhas more power to alter and change things, than human will.\"\nWith this the love-smitten youth was silent, while the Judge, after\nhearing him, was astonished, perplexed, and surprised, as well at the\nmanner and intelligence with which Don Luis had confessed the secret of\nhis heart, as at the position in which he found himself, not knowing\nwhat course to take in a matter so sudden and unexpected. All the\nanswer, therefore, he gave him was to bid him to make his mind easy for\nthe present, and arrange with his servants not to take him back that\nday, so that there might be time to consider what was best for all\nparties. Don Luis kissed his hands by force, nay, bathed them with his\ntears, in a way that would have touched a heart of marble, not to say\nthat of the Judge, who, as a shrewd man, had already perceived how\nadvantageous the marriage would be to his daughter; though, were it\npossible, he would have preferred that it should be brought about with\nthe consent of the father of Don Luis, who he knew looked for a title\nfor his son.\nThe guests had by this time made peace with the landlord, for, by\npersuasion and Don Quixote's fair words more than by threats, they had\npaid him what he demanded, and the servants of Don Luis were waiting\nfor the end of the conversation with the Judge and their master's\ndecision, when the devil, who never sleeps, contrived that the barber,\nfrom whom Don Quixote had taken Mambrino's helmet, and Sancho Panza the\ntrappings of his ass in exchange for those of his own, should at this\ninstant enter the inn; which said barber, as he led his ass to the\nstable, observed Sancho Panza engaged in repairing something or other\nbelonging to the pack-saddle; and the moment he saw it he knew it, and\nmade bold to attack Sancho, exclaiming, \"Ho, sir thief, I have caught\nyou! hand over my basin and my pack-saddle, and all my trappings that\nyou robbed me of.\"\nSancho, finding himself so unexpectedly assailed, and hearing the abuse\npoured upon him, seized the pack-saddle with one hand, and with the\nother gave the barber a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood. The\nbarber, however, was not so ready to relinquish the prize he had made\nin the pack-saddle; on the contrary, he raised such an outcry that\neveryone in the inn came running to know what the noise and quarrel\nmeant. \"Here, in the name of the king and justice!\" he cried, \"this\nthief and highwayman wants to kill me for trying to recover my\nproperty.\"\n\"You lie,\" said Sancho, \"I am no highwayman; it was in fair war my\nmaster Don Quixote won these spoils.\"\nDon Quixote was standing by at the time, highly pleased to see his\nsquire's stoutness, both offensive and defensive, and from that time\nforth he reckoned him a man of mettle, and in his heart resolved to dub\nhim a knight on the first opportunity that presented itself, feeling\nsure that the order of chivalry would be fittingly bestowed upon him.\nIn the course of the altercation, among other things the barber said,\n\"Gentlemen, this pack-saddle is mine as surely as I owe God a death,\nand I know it as well as if I had given birth to it, and here is my ass\nin the stable who will not let me lie; only try it, and if it does not\nfit him like a glove, call me a rascal; and what is more, the same day\nI was robbed of this, they robbed me likewise of a new brass basin,\nnever yet handselled, that would fetch a crown any day.\"\nAt this Don Quixote could not keep himself from answering; and\ninterposing between the two, and separating them, he placed the\npack-saddle on the ground, to lie there in sight until the truth was\nestablished, and said, \"Your worships may perceive clearly and plainly\nthe error under which this worthy squire lies when he calls a basin\nwhich was, is, and shall be the helmet of Mambrino which I won from him\nin fair war, and made myself master of by legitimate and lawful\npossession. With the pack-saddle I do not concern myself; but I may\ntell you on that head that my squire Sancho asked my permission to\nstrip off the caparison of this vanquished poltroon's steed, and with\nit adorn his own; I allowed him, and he took it; and as to its having\nbeen changed from a caparison into a pack-saddle, I can give no\nexplanation except the usual one, that such transformations will take\nplace in adventures of chivalry. To confirm all which, run, Sancho my\nson, and fetch hither the helmet which this good fellow calls a basin.\"\n\"Egad, master,\" said Sancho, \"if we have no other proof of our case\nthan what your worship puts forward, Mambrino's helmet is just as much\na basin as this good fellow's caparison is a pack-saddle.\"\n\"Do as I bid thee,\" said Don Quixote; \"it cannot be that everything in\nthis castle goes by enchantment.\"\nSancho hastened to where the basin was, and brought it back with him,",

Why, this is a thing that would astonish a whole\nuniversity, however wise it might be! That will do; if this basin is a\nhelmet, why, then the pack-saddle must be a horse's caparison, as this\ngentleman has said.\"\n\"To me it looks like a pack-saddle,\" said Don Quixote; \"but I have\nalready said that with that question I do not concern myself.\"\n\"As to whether it be pack-saddle or caparison,\" said the curate, \"it is\nonly for Se\u00f1or Don Quixote to say; for in these matters of chivalry all\nthese gentlemen and I bow to his authority.\"\n\"By God, gentlemen,\" said Don Quixote, \"so many strange things have\nhappened to me in this castle on the two occasions on which I have\nsojourned in it, that I will not venture to assert anything positively\nin reply to any question touching anything it contains; for it is my\nbelief that everything that goes on within it goes by enchantment. The\nfirst time, an enchanted Moor that there is in it gave me sore trouble,\nnor did Sancho fare well among certain followers of his; and last night\nI was kept hanging by this arm for nearly two hours, without knowing\nhow or why I came by such a mishap. So that now, for me to come forward\nto give an opinion in such a puzzling matter, would be to risk a rash\ndecision. As regards the assertion that this is a basin and not a\nhelmet I have already given an answer; but as to the question whether\nthis is a pack-saddle or a caparison I will not venture to give a\npositive opinion, but will leave it to your worships' better judgment.\nPerhaps as you are not dubbed knights like myself, the enchantments of\nthis place have nothing to do with you, and your faculties are\nunfettered, and you can see things in this castle as they really and\ntruly are, and not as they appear to me.\"\n\"There can be no question,\" said Don Fernando on this, \"but that Se\u00f1or\nDon Quixote has spoken very wisely, and that with us rests the decision\nof this matter; and that we may have surer ground to go on, I will take\nthe votes of the gentlemen in secret, and declare the result clearly\nand fully.\"\nTo those who were in on the secret of Don Quixote's humour all this\nafforded great amusement; but to those who knew nothing about it, it\nseemed the greatest nonsense in the world, in particular to the four\nservants of Don Luis, as well as to Don Luis himself, and to three\nother travellers who had by chance come to the inn, and had the\nappearance of officers of the Holy Brotherhood, as indeed they were;\nbut the one who above all was at his wits' end was the barber whose\nbasin, there before his very eyes, had been turned into Mambrino's\nhelmet, and whose pack-saddle he had no doubt whatever was about to\nbecome a rich caparison for a horse. All laughed to see Don Fernando\ngoing from one to another collecting the votes, and whispering to them\nto give him their private opinion whether the treasure over which there\nhad been so much fighting was a pack-saddle or a caparison; but after\nhe had taken the votes of those who knew Don Quixote, he said aloud,\n\"The fact is, my good fellow, that I am tired collecting such a number\nof opinions, for I find that there is not one of whom I ask what I\ndesire to know, who does not tell me that it is absurd to say that this\nis the pack-saddle of an ass, and not the caparison of a horse, nay, of\na thoroughbred horse; so you must submit, for, in spite of you and your\nass, this is a caparison and no pack-saddle, and you have stated and\nproved your case very badly.\"\n\"May I never share heaven,\" said the poor barber, \"if your worships are\nnot all mistaken; and may my soul appear before God as that appears to\nme a pack-saddle and not a caparison; but, 'laws go,'\u2014I say no more;\nand indeed I am not drunk, for I am fasting, except it be from sin.\"\nThe simple talk of the barber did not afford less amusement than the\nabsurdities of Don Quixote, who now observed:\n\"There is no more to be done now than for each to take what belongs to\nhim, and to whom God has given it, may St. Peter add his blessing.\"\nBut said one of the four servants, \"Unless, indeed, this is a\ndeliberate joke, I cannot bring myself to believe that men so\nintelligent as those present are, or seem to be, can venture to declare\nand assert that this is not a basin, and that not a pack-saddle; but as\nI perceive that they do assert and declare it, I can only come to the\nconclusion that there is some mystery in this persistence in what is so\nopposed to the evidence of experience and truth itself; for I swear\nby\"\u2014and here he rapped out a round oath\u2014\"all the people in the world\nwill not make me believe that this is not a barber's basin and that a\njackass's pack-saddle.\"\n\"It might easily be a she-ass's,\" observed the curate.\n\"It is all the same,\" said the servant; \"that is not the point; but\nwhether it is or is not a pack-saddle, as your worships say.\"\nOn hearing this one of the newly arrived officers of the Brotherhood,\nwho had been listening to the dispute and controversy, unable to\nrestrain his anger and impatience, exclaimed, \"It is a pack-saddle as\nsure as my father is my father, and whoever has said or will say\nanything else must be drunk.\"\n\"You lie like a rascally clown,\" returned Don Quixote; and lifting his\npike, which he had never let out of his hand, he delivered such a blow\nat his head that, had not the officer dodged it, it would have\nstretched him at full length. The pike was shivered in pieces against\nthe ground, and the rest of the officers, seeing their comrade\nassaulted, raised a shout, calling for help for the Holy Brotherhood.\nThe landlord, who was of the fraternity, ran at once to fetch his staff\nof office and his sword, and ranged himself on the side of his\ncomrades; the servants of Don Luis clustered round him, lest he should\nescape from them in the confusion; the barber, seeing the house turned\nupside down, once more laid hold of his pack-saddle and Sancho did the\nsame; Don Quixote drew his sword and charged the officers; Don Luis\ncried out to his servants to leave him alone and go and help Don\nQuixote, and Cardenio and Don Fernando, who were supporting him; the\ncurate was shouting at the top of his voice, the landlady was\nscreaming, her daughter was wailing, Maritornes was weeping, Dorothea\nwas aghast, Luscinda terror-stricken, and Do\u00f1a Clara in a faint. The\nbarber cudgelled Sancho, and Sancho pommelled the barber; Don Luis gave\none of his servants, who ventured to catch him by the arm to keep him\nfrom escaping, a cuff that bathed his teeth in blood; the Judge took\nhis part; Don Fernando had got one of the officers down and was\nbelabouring him heartily; the landlord raised his voice again calling\nfor help for the Holy Brotherhood; so that the whole inn was nothing\nbut cries, shouts, shrieks, confusion, terror, dismay, mishaps,\nsword-cuts, fisticuffs, cudgellings, kicks, and bloodshed; and in the\nmidst of all this chaos, complication, and general entanglement, Don\nQuixote took it into his head that he had been plunged into the thick\nof the discord of Agramante's camp; and, in a voice that shook the inn\nlike thunder, he cried out:\n\"Hold all, let all sheathe their swords, let all be calm and attend to\nme as they value their lives!\"\nAll paused at his mighty voice, and he went on to say, \"Did I not tell\nyou, sirs, that this castle was enchanted, and that a legion or so of\ndevils dwelt in it? In proof whereof I call upon you to behold with\nyour own eyes how the discord of Agramante's camp has come hither, and\nbeen transferred into the midst of us. See how they fight, there for\nthe sword, here for the horse, on that side for the eagle, on this for\nthe helmet; we are all fighting, and all at cross purposes. Come then,\nyou, Se\u00f1or Judge, and you, se\u00f1or curate; let the one represent King\nAgramante and the other King Sobrino, and make peace among us; for by\nGod Almighty it is a sorry business that so many persons of quality as\nwe are should slay one another for such trifling cause.\" The officers,\nwho did not understand Don Quixote's mode of speaking, and found\nthemselves roughly handled by Don Fernando, Cardenio, and their\ncompanions, were not to be appeased; the barber was, however, for both\nhis beard and his pack-saddle were the worse for the struggle; Sancho\nlike a good servant obeyed the slightest word of his master; while the\nfour servants of Don Luis kept quiet when they saw how little they\ngained by not being so. The landlord alone insisted upon it that they\nmust punish the insolence of this madman, who at every turn raised a\ndisturbance in the inn; but at length the uproar was stilled for the\npresent; the pack-saddle remained a caparison till the day of judgment,\nand the basin a helmet and the inn a castle in Don Quixote's\nimagination.",

It was agreed at length that\nDon Fernando should tell the servants of Don Luis who he was, and that\nit was his desire that Don Luis should accompany him to Andalusia,\nwhere he would receive from the marquis his brother the welcome his\nquality entitled him to; for, otherwise, it was easy to see from the\ndetermination of Don Luis that he would not return to his father at\npresent, though they tore him to pieces. On learning the rank of Don\nFernando and the resolution of Don Luis the four then settled it\nbetween themselves that three of them should return to tell his father\nhow matters stood, and that the other should remain to wait upon Don\nLuis, and not leave him until they came back for him, or his father's\norders were known. Thus by the authority of Agramante and the wisdom of\nKing Sobrino all this complication of disputes was arranged; but the\nenemy of concord and hater of peace, feeling himself slighted and made\na fool of, and seeing how little he had gained after having involved\nthem all in such an elaborate entanglement, resolved to try his hand\nonce more by stirring up fresh quarrels and disturbances.\nIt came about in this wise: the officers were pacified on learning the\nrank of those with whom they had been engaged, and withdrew from the\ncontest, considering that whatever the result might be they were likely\nto get the worst of the battle; but one of them, the one who had been\nthrashed and kicked by Don Fernando, recollected that among some\nwarrants he carried for the arrest of certain delinquents, he had one\nagainst Don Quixote, whom the Holy Brotherhood had ordered to be\narrested for setting the galley slaves free, as Sancho had, with very\ngood reason, apprehended. Suspecting how it was, then, he wished to\nsatisfy himself as to whether Don Quixote's features corresponded; and\ntaking a parchment out of his bosom he lit upon what he was in search\nof, and setting himself to read it deliberately, for he was not a quick\nreader, as he made out each word he fixed his eyes on Don Quixote, and\nwent on comparing the description in the warrant with his face, and\ndiscovered that beyond all doubt he was the person described in it. As\nsoon as he had satisfied himself, folding up the parchment, he took the\nwarrant in his left hand and with his right seized Don Quixote by the\ncollar so tightly that he did not allow him to breathe, and shouted\naloud, \"Help for the Holy Brotherhood! and that you may see I demand it\nin earnest, read this warrant which says this highwayman is to be\narrested.\"\nThe curate took the warrant and saw that what the officer said was\ntrue, and that it agreed with Don Quixote's appearance, who, on his\npart, when he found himself roughly handled by this rascally clown,\nworked up to the highest pitch of wrath, and all his joints cracking\nwith rage, with both hands seized the officer by the throat with all\nhis might, so that had he not been helped by his comrades he would have\nyielded up his life ere Don Quixote released his hold. The landlord,\nwho had perforce to support his brother officers, ran at once to aid\nthem. The landlady, when she saw her husband engaged in a fresh\nquarrel, lifted up her voice afresh, and its note was immediately\ncaught up by Maritornes and her daughter, calling upon heaven and all\npresent for help; and Sancho, seeing what was going on, exclaimed, \"By\nthe Lord, it is quite true what my master says about the enchantments\nof this castle, for it is impossible to live an hour in peace in it!\"\nDon Fernando parted the officer and Don Quixote, and to their mutual\ncontentment made them relax the grip by which they held, the one the\ncoat collar, the other the throat of his adversary; for all this,\nhowever, the officers did not cease to demand their prisoner and call\non them to help, and deliver him over bound into their power, as was\nrequired for the service of the King and of the Holy Brotherhood, on\nwhose behalf they again demanded aid and assistance to effect the\ncapture of this robber and footpad of the highways.\nDon Quixote smiled when he heard these words, and said very calmly,",

Infamous\nbeings, who by your vile grovelling intellects deserve that heaven\nshould not make known to you the virtue that lies in knight-errantry,\nor show you the sin and ignorance in which ye lie when ye refuse to\nrespect the shadow, not to say the presence, of any knight-errant!

In the end they, as officers of justice, settled the\nquestion by arbitration in such a manner that both sides were, if not\nperfectly contented, at least to some extent satisfied; for they\nchanged the pack-saddles, but not the girths or head-stalls; and as to\nMambrino's helmet, the curate, under the rose and without Don Quixote's\nknowing it, paid eight reals for the basin, and the barber executed a\nfull receipt and engagement to make no further demand then or\nthenceforth for evermore, amen. These two disputes, which were the most\nimportant and gravest, being settled, it only remained for the servants\nof Don Luis to consent that three of them should return while one was\nleft to accompany him whither Don Fernando desired to take him; and\ngood luck and better fortune, having already begun to solve\ndifficulties and remove obstructions in favour of the lovers and\nwarriors of the inn, were pleased to persevere and bring everything to\na happy issue; for the servants agreed to do as Don Luis wished; which\ngave Do\u00f1a Clara such happiness that no one could have looked into her\nface just then without seeing the joy of her heart. Zoraida, though she\ndid not fully comprehend all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing\nwhy, as she watched and studied the various countenances, but\nparticularly her Spaniard's, whom she followed with her eyes and clung\nto with her soul. The gift and compensation which the curate gave the\nbarber had not escaped the landlord's notice, and he demanded Don\nQuixote's reckoning, together with the amount of the damage to his\nwine-skins, and the loss of his wine, swearing that neither Rocinante\nnor Sancho's ass should leave the inn until he had been paid to the\nvery last farthing. The curate settled all amicably, and Don Fernando\npaid; though the Judge had also very readily offered to pay the score;\nand all became so peaceful and quiet that the inn no longer reminded\none of the discord of Agramante's camp, as Don Quixote said, but of the\npeace and tranquillity of the days of Octavianus: for all which it was\nthe universal opinion that their thanks were due to the great zeal and\neloquence of the curate, and to the unexampled generosity of Don\nFernando.\nFinding himself now clear and quit of all quarrels, his squire's as\nwell as his own, Don Quixote considered that it would be advisable to\ncontinue the journey he had begun, and bring to a close that great\nadventure for which he had been called and chosen; and with this high\nresolve he went and knelt before Dorothea, who, however, would not\nallow him to utter a word until he had risen; so to obey her he rose,\nand said, \"It is a common proverb, fair lady, that 'diligence is the\nmother of good fortune,' and experience has often shown in important\naffairs that the earnestness of the negotiator brings the doubtful case\nto a successful termination; but in nothing does this truth show itself\nmore plainly than in war, where quickness and activity forestall the\ndevices of the enemy, and win the victory before the foe has time to\ndefend himself. All this I say, exalted and esteemed lady, because it\nseems to me that for us to remain any longer in this castle now is\nuseless, and may be injurious to us in a way that we shall find out\nsome day; for who knows but that your enemy the giant may have learned\nby means of secret and diligent spies that I am going to destroy him,\nand if the opportunity be given him he may seize it to fortify himself\nin some impregnable castle or stronghold, against which all my efforts\nand the might of my indefatigable arm may avail but little? Therefore,\nlady, let us, as I say, forestall his schemes by our activity, and let\nus depart at once in quest of fair fortune; for your highness is only\nkept from enjoying it as fully as you could desire by my delay in\nencountering your adversary.\"\nDon Quixote held his peace and said no more, calmly awaiting the reply\nof the beauteous princess, who, with commanding dignity and in a style\nadapted to Don Quixote's own, replied to him in these words, \"I give\nyou thanks, sir knight, for the eagerness you, like a good knight to\nwhom it is a natural obligation to succour the orphan and the needy,\ndisplay to afford me aid in my sore trouble; and heaven grant that your\nwishes and mine may be realised, so that you may see that there are\nwomen in this world capable of gratitude; as to my departure, let it be\nforthwith, for I have no will but yours; dispose of me entirely in\naccordance with your good pleasure; for she who has once entrusted to\nyou the defence of her person, and placed in your hands the recovery of\nher dominions, must not think of offering opposition to that which your\nwisdom may ordain.\"\n\"On, then, in God's name,\" said Don Quixote; \"for, when a lady humbles\nherself to me, I will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and\nplacing her on the throne of her ancestors. Let us depart at once, for\nthe common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my\neagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell\nseen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle Rocinante, Sancho, and\nget ready thy ass and the queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the\ncastellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant.\"\nSancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, \"Ah!\nmaster, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears\nof, begging all good bodies' pardon.\"\n\"What mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the\nworld, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?\" said Don Quixote.\n\"If your worship is angry,\" replied Sancho, \"I will hold my tongue and\nleave unsaid what as a good squire I am bound to say, and what a good\nservant should tell his master.\"\n\"Say what thou wilt,\" returned Don Quixote, \"provided thy words be not\nmeant to work upon my fears; for thou, if thou fearest, art behaving\nlike thyself; but I like myself, in not fearing.\"\n\"It is nothing of the sort, as I am a sinner before God,\" said Sancho,\n\"but that I take it to be sure and certain that this lady, who calls\nherself queen of the great kingdom of Micomicon, is no more so than my\nmother; for, if she was what she says, she would not go rubbing noses\nwith one that is here every instant and behind every door.\"\nDorothea turned red at Sancho's words, for the truth was that her\nhusband Don Fernando had now and then, when the others were not\nlooking, gathered from her lips some of the reward his love had earned,\nand Sancho seeing this had considered that such freedom was more like a\ncourtesan than a queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable\nor not caring to answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued,\n\"This I say, se\u00f1or, because, if after we have travelled roads and\nhighways, and passed bad nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying\nhimself in this inn is to reap the fruit of our labours, there is no\nneed for me to be in a hurry to saddle Rocinante, put the pad on the\nass, or get ready the palfrey; for it will be better for us to stay\nquiet, and let every jade mind her spinning, and let us go to dinner.\"\nGood God, what was the indignation of Don Quixote when he heard the\naudacious words of his squire! So great was it, that in a voice\ninarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed\nliving fire, he exclaimed, \"Rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and\nignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and slanderer!\nHast thou dared to utter such words in my presence and in that of these\nillustrious ladies? Hast thou dared to harbour such gross and shameless\nthoughts in thy muddled imagination? Begone from my presence, thou born\nmonster, storehouse of lies, hoard of untruths, garner of knaveries,\ninventor of scandals, publisher of absurdities, enemy of the respect\ndue to royal personages! Begone, show thyself no more before me under\npain of my wrath;\" and so saying he knitted his brows, puffed out his\ncheeks, gazed around him, and stamped on the ground violently with his\nright foot, showing in every way the rage that was pent up in his\nheart; and at his words and furious gestures Sancho was so scared and\nterrified that he would have been glad if the earth had opened that\ninstant and swallowed him, and his only thought was to turn round and\nmake his escape from the angry presence of his master.\nBut the ready-witted Dorothea, who by this time so well understood Don\nQuixote's humour, said, to mollify his wrath, \"Be not irritated at the\nabsurdities your good squire has uttered, Sir Knight of the Rueful\nCountenance, for perhaps he did not utter them without cause, and from\nhis good sense and Christian conscience it is not likely that he would\nbear false witness against anyone. We may therefore believe, without\nany hesitation, that since, as you say, sir knight, everything in this\ncastle goes and is brought about by means of enchantment, Sancho, I\nsay, may possibly have seen, through this diabolical medium, what he\nsays he saw so much to the detriment of my modesty.\"\n\"I swear by God Omnipotent,\" exclaimed Don Quixote at this, \"your\nhighness has hit the point; and that some vile illusion must have come\nbefore this sinner of a Sancho, that made him see what it would have\nbeen impossible to see by any other means than enchantments; for I know\nwell enough, from the poor fellow's goodness and harmlessness, that he\nis incapable of bearing false witness against anybody.\"\n\"True, no doubt,\" said Don Fernando, \"for which reason, Se\u00f1or Don\nQuixote, you ought to forgive him and restore him to the bosom of your\nfavour, _sicut erat in principio_, before illusions of this sort had\ntaken away his senses.\"\nDon Quixote said he was ready to pardon him, and the curate went for\nSancho, who came in very humbly, and falling on his knees begged for\nthe hand of his master, who having presented it to him and allowed him\nto kiss it, gave him his blessing and said, \"Now, Sancho my son, thou\nwilt be convinced of the truth of what I have many a time told thee,\nthat everything in this castle is done by means of enchantment.\"\n\"So it is, I believe,\" said Sancho, \"except the affair of the blanket,\nwhich came to pass in reality by ordinary means.\"\n\"Believe it not,\" said Don Quixote, \"for had it been so, I would have\navenged thee that instant, or even now; but neither then nor now could\nI, nor have I seen anyone upon whom to avenge thy wrong.\"\nThey were all eager to know what the affair of the blanket was, and the\nlandlord gave them a minute account of Sancho's flights, at which they\nlaughed not a little, and at which Sancho would have been no less out\nof countenance had not his master once more assured him it was all\nenchantment. For all that his simplicity never reached so high a pitch\nthat he could persuade himself it was not the plain and simple truth,\nwithout any deception whatever about it, that he had been blanketed by\nbeings of flesh and blood, and not by visionary and imaginary phantoms,",

They constructed a kind of cage with wooden bars, large enough\nto hold Don Quixote comfortably; and then Don Fernando and his\ncompanions, the servants of Don Luis, and the officers of the\nBrotherhood, together with the landlord, by the directions and advice\nof the curate, covered their faces and disguised themselves, some in\none way, some in another, so as to appear to Don Quixote quite\ndifferent from the persons he had seen in the castle. This done, in\nprofound silence they entered the room where he was asleep, taking his\nrest after the past frays, and advancing to where he was sleeping\ntranquilly, not dreaming of anything of the kind happening, they seized\nhim firmly and bound him fast hand and foot, so that, when he awoke\nstartled, he was unable to move, and could only marvel and wonder at\nthe strange figures he saw before him; upon which he at once gave way\nto the idea which his crazed fancy invariably conjured up before him,\nand took it into his head that all these shapes were phantoms of the\nenchanted castle, and that he himself was unquestionably enchanted as\nhe could neither move nor help himself; precisely what the curate, the\nconcoctor of the scheme, expected would happen. Of all that were there\nSancho was the only one who was at once in his senses and in his own\nproper character, and he, though he was within very little of sharing\nhis master's infirmity, did not fail to perceive who all these\ndisguised figures were; but he did not dare to open his lips until he\nsaw what came of this assault and capture of his master; nor did the\nlatter utter a word, waiting to the upshot of his mishap; which was\nthat bringing in the cage, they shut him up in it and nailed the bars\nso firmly that they could not be easily burst open.\nc46b.jpg (342K)\nFull Size\nThey then took him on their shoulders, and as they passed out of the\nroom an awful voice\u2014as much so as the barber, not he of the pack-saddle\nbut the other, was able to make it\u2014was heard to say, \"O Knight of the\nRueful Countenance, let not this captivity in which thou art placed\nafflict thee, for this must needs be, for the more speedy\naccomplishment of the adventure in which thy great heart has engaged\nthee; the which shall be accomplished when the raging Manchegan lion\nand the white Tobosan dove shall be linked together, having first\nhumbled their haughty necks to the gentle yoke of matrimony. And from\nthis marvellous union shall come forth to the light of the world brave\nwhelps that shall rival the ravening claws of their valiant father; and\nthis shall come to pass ere the pursuer of the flying nymph shall in\nhis swift natural course have twice visited the starry signs. And thou,\nO most noble and obedient squire that ever bore sword at side, beard on\nface, or nose to smell with, be not dismayed or grieved to see the\nflower of knight-errantry carried away thus before thy very eyes; for\nsoon, if it so please the Framer of the universe, thou shalt see\nthyself exalted to such a height that thou shalt not know thyself, and\nthe promises which thy good master has made thee shall not prove false;\nand I assure thee, on the authority of the sage Mentironiana, that thy\nwages shall be paid thee, as thou shalt see in due season. Follow then\nthe footsteps of the valiant enchanted knight, for it is expedient that\nthou shouldst go to the destination assigned to both of you; and as it\nis not permitted to me to say more, God be with thee; for I return to\nthat place I wot of;\" and as he brought the prophecy to a close he\nraised his voice to a high pitch, and then lowered it to such a soft\ntone, that even those who knew it was all a joke were almost inclined\nto take what they heard seriously.\nDon Quixote was comforted by the prophecy he heard, for he at once\ncomprehended its meaning perfectly, and perceived it was promised to\nhim that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with\nhis beloved Dulcinea del Toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed\nthe whelps, his sons, to the eternal glory of La Mancha; and being\nthoroughly and firmly persuaded of this, he lifted up his voice, and\nwith a deep sigh exclaimed, \"Oh thou, whoever thou art, who hast\nforetold me so much good, I implore of thee that on my part thou\nentreat that sage enchanter who takes charge of my interests, that he\nleave me not to perish in this captivity in which they are now carrying\nme away, ere I see fulfilled promises so joyful and incomparable as\nthose which have been now made me; for, let this but come to pass, and\nI shall glory in the pains of my prison, find comfort in these chains\nwherewith they bind me, and regard this bed whereon they stretch me,\nnot as a hard battle-field, but as a soft and happy nuptial couch; and\ntouching the consolation of Sancho Panza, my squire, I rely upon his\ngoodness and rectitude that he will not desert me in good or evil\nfortune; for if, by his ill luck or mine, it may not happen to be in my\npower to give him the island I have promised, or any equivalent for it,\nat least his wages shall not be lost; for in my will, which is already\nmade, I have declared the sum that shall be paid to him, measured, not\nby his many faithful services, but by the means at my disposal.\"\nSancho bowed his head very respectfully and kissed both his hands, for,\nbeing tied together, he could not kiss one; and then the apparitions\nlifted the cage upon their shoulders and fixed it upon the ox-cart.",

            "text": "At this point Sancho Panza, who had drawn near to hear the\nconversation, said, in order to make everything plain, \"Well, sirs, you\nmay like or dislike what I am going to say, but the fact of the matter\nis, my master, Don Quixote, is just as much enchanted as my mother. He\nis in his full senses, he eats and he drinks, and he has his calls like\nother men and as he had yesterday, before they caged him. And if that's\nthe case, what do they mean by wanting me to believe that he is\nenchanted? For I have heard many a one say that enchanted people\nneither eat, nor sleep, nor talk; and my master, if you don't stop him,\nwill talk more than thirty lawyers.\" Then turning to the curate he\nexclaimed, \"Ah, se\u00f1or curate, se\u00f1or curate! do you think I don't know\nyou? Do you think I don't guess and see the drift of these new\nenchantments? Well then, I can tell you I know you, for all your face\nis covered, and I can tell you I am up to you, however you may hide\nyour tricks. After all, where envy reigns virtue cannot live, and where\nthere is niggardliness there can be no liberality. Ill betide the\ndevil! if it had not been for your worship my master would be married\nto the Princess Micomicona this minute, and I should be a count at\nleast; for no less was to be expected, as well from the goodness of my\nmaster, him of the Rueful Countenance, as from the greatness of my\nservices. But I see now how true it is what they say in these parts,\nthat the wheel of fortune turns faster than a mill-wheel, and that\nthose who were up yesterday are down to-day. I am sorry for my wife and\nchildren, for when they might fairly and reasonably expect to see their\nfather return to them a governor or viceroy of some island or kingdom,\nthey will see him come back a horse-boy. I have said all this, se\u00f1or\ncurate, only to urge your paternity to lay to your conscience your\nill-treatment of my master; and have a care that God does not call you\nto account in another life for making a prisoner of him in this way,\nand charge against you all the succours and good deeds that my lord Don\nQuixote leaves undone while he is shut up.\n\"Trim those lamps there!\" exclaimed the barber at this; \"so you are of\nthe same fraternity as your master, too, Sancho? By God, I begin to see\nthat you will have to keep him company in the cage, and be enchanted\nlike him for having caught some of his humour and chivalry. It was an\nevil hour when you let yourself be got with child by his promises, and\nthat island you long so much for found its way into your head.\"\n\"I am not with child by anyone,\" returned Sancho, \"nor am I a man to\nlet myself be got with child, if it was by the King himself. Though I\nam poor I am an old Christian, and I owe nothing to nobody, and if I\nlong for an island, other people long for worse. Each of us is the son\nof his own works; and being a man I may come to be pope, not to say\ngovernor of an island, especially as my master may win so many that he\nwill not know whom to give them to. Mind how you talk, master barber;\nfor shaving is not everything, and there is some difference between\nPeter and Peter. I say this because we all know one another, and it\nwill not do to throw false dice with me; and as to the enchantment of\nmy master, God knows the truth; leave it as it is; it only makes it\nworse to stir it.\"\nThe barber did not care to answer Sancho lest by his plain speaking he\nshould disclose what the curate and he himself were trying so hard to",

            "text": "he said, \"To tell the truth, se\u00f1or curate, I for my part consider what\nthey call books of chivalry to be mischievous to the State; and though,\nled by idle and false taste, I have read the beginnings of almost all\nthat have been printed, I never could manage to read any one of them\nfrom beginning to end; for it seems to me they are all more or less the\nsame thing; and one has nothing more in it than another; this no more\nthan that. And in my opinion this sort of writing and composition is of\nthe same species as the fables they call the Milesian, nonsensical\ntales that aim solely at giving amusement and not instruction, exactly\nthe opposite of the apologue fables which amuse and instruct at the\nsame time. And though it may be the chief object of such books to\namuse, I do not know how they can succeed, when they are so full of\nsuch monstrous nonsense. For the enjoyment the mind feels must come\nfrom the beauty and harmony which it perceives or contemplates in the\nthings that the eye or the imagination brings before it; and nothing\nthat has any ugliness or disproportion about it can give any pleasure.\nWhat beauty, then, or what proportion of the parts to the whole, or of\nthe whole to the parts, can there be in a book or fable where a lad of\nsixteen cuts down a giant as tall as a tower and makes two halves of\nhim as if he was an almond cake? And when they want to give us a\npicture of a battle, after having told us that there are a million of\ncombatants on the side of the enemy, let the hero of the book be\nopposed to them, and we have perforce to believe, whether we like it or\nnot, that the said knight wins the victory by the single might of his\nstrong arm. And then, what shall we say of the facility with which a\nborn queen or empress will give herself over into the arms of some\nunknown wandering knight? What mind, that is not wholly barbarous and\nuncultured, can find pleasure in reading of how a great tower full of\nknights sails away across the sea like a ship with a fair wind, and\nwill be to-night in Lombardy and to-morrow morning in the land of\nPrester John of the Indies, or some other that Ptolemy never described\nnor Marco Polo saw? And if, in answer to this, I am told that the\nauthors of books of the kind write them as fiction, and therefore are\nnot bound to regard niceties of truth, I would reply that fiction is\nall the better the more it looks like truth, and gives the more\npleasure the more probability and possibility there is about it. Plots\nin fiction should be wedded to the understanding of the reader, and be\nconstructed in such a way that, reconciling impossibilities, smoothing\nover difficulties, keeping the mind on the alert, they may surprise,\ninterest, divert, and entertain, so that wonder and delight joined may\nkeep pace one with the other; all which he will fail to effect who\nshuns verisimilitude and truth to nature, wherein lies the perfection\nof writing. I have never yet seen any book of chivalry that puts\ntogether a connected plot complete in all its numbers, so that the\nmiddle agrees with the beginning, and the end with the beginning and\nmiddle; on the contrary, they construct them with such a multitude of\nmembers that it seems as though they meant to produce a chimera or\nmonster rather than a well-proportioned figure. And besides all this\nthey are harsh in their style, incredible in their achievements,\nlicentious in their amours, uncouth in their courtly speeches, prolix\nin their battles, silly in their arguments, absurd in their travels,\nand, in short, wanting in everything like intelligent art; for which\nreason they deserve to be banished from the Christian commonwealth as a\nworthless breed.\"",

            "text": "\"It is as you say, se\u00f1or canon,\" said the curate; \"and for that reason\nthose who have hitherto written books of the sort deserve all the more\ncensure for writing without paying any attention to good taste or the\nrules of art, by which they might guide themselves and become as famous\nin prose as the two princes of Greek and Latin poetry are in verse.\"\n\"I myself, at any rate,\" said the canon, \"was once tempted to write a\nbook of chivalry in which all the points I have mentioned were to be\nobserved; and if I must own the truth I have more than a hundred sheets\nwritten; and to try if it came up to my own opinion of it, I showed\nthem to persons who were fond of this kind of reading, to learned and\nintelligent men as well as to ignorant people who cared for nothing but\nthe pleasure of listening to nonsense, and from all I obtained\nflattering approval; nevertheless I proceeded no farther with it, as\nwell because it seemed to me an occupation inconsistent with my\nprofession, as because I perceived that the fools are more numerous\nthan the wise; and, though it is better to be praised by the wise few\nthan applauded by the foolish many, I have no mind to submit myself to\nthe stupid judgment of the silly public, to whom the reading of such\nbooks falls for the most part.\n\"But what most of all made me hold my hand and even abandon all idea of\nfinishing it was an argument I put to myself taken from the plays that\nare acted now-a-days, which was in this wise: if those that are now in\nvogue, as well those that are pure invention as those founded on\nhistory, are, all or most of them, downright nonsense and things that\nhave neither head nor tail, and yet the public listens to them with\ndelight, and regards and cries them up as perfection when they are so\nfar from it; and if the authors who write them, and the players who act\nthem, say that this is what they must be, for the public wants this and\nwill have nothing else; and that those that go by rule and work out a\nplot according to the laws of art will only find some half-dozen\nintelligent people to understand them, while all the rest remain blind\nto the merit of their composition; and that for themselves it is better\nto get bread from the many than praise from the few; then my book will\nfare the same way, after I have burnt off my eyebrows in trying to\nobserve the principles I have spoken of, and I shall be 'the tailor of\nthe corner.' And though I have sometimes endeavoured to convince actors\nthat they are mistaken in this notion they have adopted, and that they\nwould attract more people, and get more credit, by producing plays in\naccordance with the rules of art, than by absurd ones, they are so\nthoroughly wedded to their own opinion that no argument or evidence can\nwean them from it.\n\"I remember saying one day to one of these obstinate fellows, 'Tell me,\ndo you not recollect that a few years ago, there were three tragedies\nacted in Spain, written by a famous poet of these kingdoms, which were\nsuch that they filled all who heard them with admiration, delight, and\ninterest, the ignorant as well as the wise, the masses as well as the\nhigher orders, and brought in more money to the performers, these three\nalone, than thirty of the best that have been since produced?'\n\"'No doubt,' replied the actor in question, 'you mean the \"Isabella,\"\nthe \"Phyllis,\" and the \"Alexandra.\"'\n\"'Those are the ones I mean,' said I; 'and see if they did not observe\nthe principles of art, and if, by observing them, they failed to show\ntheir superiority and please all the world; so that the fault does not\nlie with the public that insists upon nonsense, but with those who\ndon't know how to produce something else. \"The Ingratitude Revenged\"\nwas not nonsense, nor was there any in \"The Numantia,\" nor any to be\nfound in \"The Merchant Lover,\" nor yet in \"The Friendly Fair Foe,\" nor\nin some others that have been written by certain gifted poets, to their\nown fame and renown, and to the profit of those that brought them out;'\nsome further remarks I added to these, with which, I think, I left him\nrather dumbfoundered, but not so satisfied or convinced that I could\ndisabuse him of his error.\"",

            "text": "\"You have touched upon a subject, se\u00f1or canon,\" observed the curate\nhere, \"that has awakened an old enmity I have against the plays in\nvogue at the present day, quite as strong as that which I bear to the\nbooks of chivalry; for while the drama, according to Tully, should be\nthe mirror of human life, the model of manners, and the image of the\ntruth, those which are presented now-a-days are mirrors of nonsense,\nmodels of folly, and images of lewdness. For what greater nonsense can\nthere be in connection with what we are now discussing than for an\ninfant to appear in swaddling clothes in the first scene of the first\nact, and in the second a grown-up bearded man? Or what greater\nabsurdity can there be than putting before us an old man as a\nswashbuckler, a young man as a poltroon, a lackey using fine language,\na page giving sage advice, a king plying as a porter, a princess who is\na kitchen-maid? And then what shall I say of their attention to the\ntime in which the action they represent may or can take place, save\nthat I have seen a play where the first act began in Europe, the second\nin Asia, the third finished in Africa, and no doubt, had it been in\nfour acts, the fourth would have ended in America, and so it would have\nbeen laid in all four quarters of the globe? And if truth to life is\nthe main thing the drama should keep in view, how is it possible for\nany average understanding to be satisfied when the action is supposed\nto pass in the time of King Pepin or Charlemagne, and the principal\npersonage in it they represent to be the Emperor Heraclius who entered\nJerusalem with the cross and won the Holy Sepulchre, like Godfrey of\nBouillon, there being years innumerable between the one and the other?\nor, if the play is based on fiction and historical facts are\nintroduced, or bits of what occurred to different people and at\ndifferent times mixed up with it, all, not only without any semblance\nof probability, but with obvious errors that from every point of view\nare inexcusable? And the worst of it is, there are ignorant people who\nsay that this is perfection, and that anything beyond this is affected\nrefinement. And then if we turn to sacred dramas\u2014what miracles they\ninvent in them! What apocryphal, ill-devised incidents, attributing to\none saint the miracles of another! And even in secular plays they\nventure to introduce miracles without any reason or object except that\nthey think some such miracle, or transformation as they call it, will\ncome in well to astonish stupid people and draw them to the play. All\nthis tends to the prejudice of the truth and the corruption of history,\nnay more, to the reproach of the wits of Spain; for foreigners who\nscrupulously observe the laws of the drama look upon us as barbarous\nand ignorant, when they see the absurdity and nonsense of the plays we\nproduce. Nor will it be a sufficient excuse to say that the chief\nobject well-ordered governments have in view when they permit plays to\nbe performed in public is to entertain the people with some harmless\namusement occasionally, and keep it from those evil humours which\nidleness is apt to engender; and that, as this may be attained by any\nsort of play, good or bad, there is no need to lay down laws, or bind\nthose who write or act them to make them as they ought to be made,\nsince, as I say, the object sought for may be secured by any sort. To\nthis I would reply that the same end would be, beyond all comparison,\nbetter attained by means of good plays than by those that are not so;\nfor after listening to an artistic and properly constructed play, the\nhearer will come away enlivened by the jests, instructed by the serious\nparts, full of admiration at the incidents, his wits sharpened by the\narguments, warned by the tricks, all the wiser for the examples,\ninflamed against vice, and in love with virtue; for in all these ways a\ngood play will stimulate the mind of the hearer be he ever so boorish\nor dull; and of all impossibilities the greatest is that a play endowed\nwith all these qualities will not entertain, satisfy, and please much\nmore than one wanting in them, like the greater number of those which\nare commonly acted now-a-days. Nor are the poets who write them to be\nblamed for this; for some there are among them who are perfectly well\naware of their faults, and know what they ought to do; but as plays\nhave become a salable commodity, they say, and with truth, that the\nactors will not buy them unless they are after this fashion; and so the\npoet tries to adapt himself to the requirements of the actor who is to\npay him for his work. And that this is the truth may be seen by the\ncountless plays that a most fertile wit of these kingdoms has written,\nwith so much brilliancy, so much grace and gaiety, such polished\nversification, such choice language, such profound reflections, and in\na word, so rich in eloquence and elevation of style, that he has filled\nthe world with his fame; and yet, in consequence of his desire to suit\nthe taste of the actors, they have not all, as some of them have, come\nas near perfection as they ought. Others write plays with such\nheedlessness that, after they have been acted, the actors have to fly\nand abscond, afraid of being punished, as they often have been, for\nhaving acted something offensive to some king or other, or insulting to\nsome noble family. All which evils, and many more that I say nothing\nof, would be removed if there were some intelligent and sensible person\nat the capital to examine all plays before they were acted, not only\nthose produced in the capital itself, but all that were intended to be\nacted in Spain; without whose approval, seal, and signature, no local\nmagistracy should allow any play to be acted. In that case actors would\ntake care to send their plays to the capital, and could act them in\nsafety, and those who write them would be more careful and take more\npains with their work, standing in awe of having to submit it to the\nstrict examination of one who understood the matter; and so good plays\nwould be produced and the objects they aim at happily attained; as well\nthe amusement of the people, as the credit of the wits of Spain, the\ninterest and safety of the actors, and the saving of trouble in\ninflicting punishment on them. And if the same or some other person\nwere authorised to examine the newly written books of chivalry, no\ndoubt some would appear with all the perfections you have described,\nenriching our language with the gracious and precious treasure of\neloquence, and driving the old books into obscurity before the light of\nthe new ones that would come out for the harmless entertainment, not\nmerely of the idle but of the very busiest; for the bow cannot be\nalways bent, nor can weak human nature exist without some lawful\namusement.\"",

But as it is so, I will prove plainly to you that you are\nnot enchanted. Now tell me, so may God deliver you from this\naffliction, and so may you find yourself when you least expect it in\nthe arms of my lady Dulcinea\u2014\"\n\"Leave off conjuring me,\" said Don Quixote, \"and ask what thou wouldst\nknow; I have already told thee I will answer with all possible\nprecision.\"\n\"That is what I want,\" said Sancho; \"and what I would know, and have\nyou tell me, without adding or leaving out anything, but telling the\nwhole truth as one expects it to be told, and as it is told, by all who\nprofess arms, as your worship professes them, under the title of\nknights-errant\u2014\"\n\"I tell thee I will not lie in any particular,\" said Don Quixote;\n\"finish thy question; for in truth thou weariest me with all these\nasseverations, requirements, and precautions, Sancho.\"\n\"Well, I rely on the goodness and truth of my master,\" said Sancho;\n\"and so, because it bears upon what we are talking about, I would ask,\nspeaking with all reverence, whether since your worship has been shut\nup and, as you think, enchanted in this cage, you have felt any desire\nor inclination to go anywhere, as the saying is?\"\n\"I do not understand 'going anywhere,'\" said Don Quixote; \"explain\nthyself more clearly, Sancho, if thou wouldst have me give an answer to\nthe point.\"\n\"Is it possible,\" said Sancho, \"that your worship does not understand\n'going anywhere'? Why, the schoolboys know that from the time they were\nbabes. Well then, you must know I mean have you had any desire to do\nwhat cannot be avoided?\"\n\"Ah! now I understand thee, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"yes, often, and\neven this minute; get me out of this strait, or all will not go right.\"\nc48e.jpg (32K)",

And so, moved by compassion,\nhe said to him, as they all sat on the green grass awaiting the arrival\nof the provisions:\n\"Is it possible, gentle sir, that the nauseous and idle reading of\nbooks of chivalry can have had such an effect on your worship as to\nupset your reason so that you fancy yourself enchanted, and the like,\nall as far from the truth as falsehood itself is? How can there be any\nhuman understanding that can persuade itself there ever was all that\ninfinity of Amadises in the world, or all that multitude of famous\nknights, all those emperors of Trebizond, all those Felixmartes of\nHircania, all those palfreys, and damsels-errant, and serpents, and\nmonsters, and giants, and marvellous adventures, and enchantments of\nevery kind, and battles, and prodigious encounters, splendid costumes,\nlove-sick princesses, squires made counts, droll dwarfs, love letters,\nbillings and cooings, swashbuckler women, and, in a word, all that\nnonsense the books of chivalry contain? For myself, I can only say that\nwhen I read them, so long as I do not stop to think that they are all\nlies and frivolity, they give me a certain amount of pleasure; but when\nI come to consider what they are, I fling the very best of them at the\nwall, and would fling it into the fire if there were one at hand, as\nrichly deserving such punishment as cheats and impostors out of the\nrange of ordinary toleration, and as founders of new sects and modes of\nlife, and teachers that lead the ignorant public to believe and accept\nas truth all the folly they contain. And such is their audacity, they\neven dare to unsettle the wits of gentlemen of birth and intelligence,\nas is shown plainly by the way they have served your worship, when they\nhave brought you to such a pass that you have to be shut up in a cage\nand carried on an ox-cart as one would carry a lion or a tiger from\nplace to place to make money by showing it. Come, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote,\nhave some compassion for yourself, return to the bosom of common sense,\nand make use of the liberal share of it that heaven has been pleased to\nbestow upon you, employing your abundant gifts of mind in some other\nreading that may serve to benefit your conscience and add to your\nhonour. And if, still led away by your natural bent, you desire to read\nbooks of achievements and of chivalry, read the Book of Judges in the\nHoly Scriptures, for there you will find grand reality, and deeds as\ntrue as they are heroic. Lusitania had a Viriatus, Rome a C\u00e6sar,\nCarthage a Hannibal, Greece an Alexander, Castile a Count Fernan\nGonzalez, Valencia a Cid, Andalusia a Gonzalo Fernandez, Estremadura a\nDiego Garc\u00eda de Paredes, Jerez a Garci Perez de Vargas, Toledo a\nGarcilaso, Seville a Don Manuel de Leon, to read of whose valiant deeds\nwill entertain and instruct the loftiest minds and fill them with\ndelight and wonder. Here, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote, will be reading worthy of\nyour sound understanding; from which you will rise learned in history,\nin love with virtue, strengthened in goodness, improved in manners,\nbrave without rashness, prudent without cowardice; and all to the\nhonour of God, your own advantage and the glory of La Mancha, whence, I\nam informed, your worship derives your birth.\"",

For to try to persuade anybody that Amadis, and all\nthe other knights-adventurers with whom the books are filled, never\nexisted, would be like trying to persuade him that the sun does not\nyield light, or ice cold, or earth nourishment. What wit in the world\ncan persuade another that the story of the Princess Floripes and Guy of\nBurgundy is not true, or that of Fierabras and the bridge of Mantible,\nwhich happened in the time of Charlemagne? For by all that is good it\nis as true as that it is daylight now; and if it be a lie, it must be a\nlie too that there was a Hector, or Achilles, or Trojan war, or Twelve\nPeers of France, or Arthur of England, who still lives changed into a\nraven, and is unceasingly looked for in his kingdom. One might just as\nwell try to make out that the history of Guarino Mezquino, or of the\nquest of the Holy Grail, is false, or that the loves of Tristram and\nthe Queen Yseult are apocryphal, as well as those of Guinevere and\nLancelot, when there are persons who can almost remember having seen\nthe Dame Quinta\u00f1ona, who was the best cupbearer in Great Britain. And\nso true is this, that I recollect a grandmother of mine on the father's\nside, whenever she saw any dame in a venerable hood, used to say to me,\n'Grandson, that one is like Dame Quinta\u00f1ona,' from which I conclude\nthat she must have known her, or at least had managed to see some\nportrait of her. Then who can deny that the story of Pierres and the\nfair Magalona is true, when even to this day may be seen in the king's\narmoury the pin with which the valiant Pierres guided the wooden horse\nhe rode through the air, and it is a trifle bigger than the pole of a\ncart? And alongside of the pin is Babieca's saddle, and at Roncesvalles\nthere is Roland's horn, as large as a large beam; whence we may infer\nthat there were Twelve Peers, and a Pierres, and a Cid, and other\nknights like them, of the sort people commonly call adventurers. Or\nperhaps I shall be told, too, that there was no such knight-errant as\nthe valiant Lusitanian Juan de Merlo, who went to Burgundy and in the\ncity of Arras fought with the famous lord of Charny, Mosen Pierres by\nname, and afterwards in the city of Basle with Mosen Enrique de\nRemesten, coming out of both encounters covered with fame and honour;\nor adventures and challenges achieved and delivered, also in Burgundy,\nby the valiant Spaniards Pedro Barba and Gutierre Quixada (of whose\nfamily I come in the direct male line), when they vanquished the sons\nof the Count of San Polo. I shall be told, too, that Don Fernando de\nGuevara did not go in quest of adventures to Germany, where he engaged\nin combat with Micer George, a knight of the house of the Duke of\nAustria. I shall be told that the jousts of Suero de Qui\u00f1ones, him of\nthe 'Paso,' and the emprise of Mosen Luis de Falces against the\nCastilian knight, Don Gonzalo de Guzman, were mere mockeries; as well\nas many other achievements of Christian knights of these and foreign\nrealms, which are so authentic and true, that, I repeat, he who denies\nthem must be totally wanting in reason and good sense.\"",

For the truth of the matter is they were\nknights chosen by the kings of France, and called 'Peers' because they\nwere all equal in worth, rank and prowess (at least if they were not\nthey ought to have been), and it was a kind of religious order like\nthose of Santiago and Calatrava in the present day, in which it is\nassumed that those who take it are valiant knights of distinction and\ngood birth; and just as we say now a Knight of St. John, or of\nAlc\u00e1ntara, they used to say then a Knight of the Twelve Peers, because\ntwelve equals were chosen for that military order.

And above all when\nthey carry such an appearance of truth with them; for they tell us the\nfather, mother, country, kindred, age, place, and the achievements,\nstep by step, and day by day, performed by such a knight or knights!\nHush, sir; utter not such blasphemy; trust me I am advising you now to\nact as a sensible man should; only read them, and you will see the\npleasure you will derive from them. For, come, tell me, can there be\nanything more delightful than to see, as it were, here now displayed\nbefore us a vast lake of bubbling pitch with a host of snakes and\nserpents and lizards, and ferocious and terrible creatures of all sorts\nswimming about in it, while from the middle of the lake there comes a\nplaintive voice saying: 'Knight, whosoever thou art who beholdest this\ndread lake, if thou wouldst win the prize that lies hidden beneath\nthese dusky waves, prove the valour of thy stout heart and cast thyself\ninto the midst of its dark burning waters, else thou shalt not be\nworthy to see the mighty wonders contained in the seven castles of the\nseven Fays that lie beneath this black expanse;' and then the knight,\nalmost ere the awful voice has ceased, without stopping to consider,\nwithout pausing to reflect upon the danger to which he is exposing\nhimself, without even relieving himself of the weight of his massive\narmour, commending himself to God and to his lady, plunges into the\nmidst of the boiling lake, and when he little looks for it, or knows\nwhat his fate is to be, he finds himself among flowery meadows, with\nwhich the Elysian fields are not to be compared.\nc50b.jpg (344K)\nFull Size\n\"The sky seems more transparent there, and the sun shines with a\nstrange brilliancy, and a delightful grove of green leafy trees\npresents itself to the eyes and charms the sight with its verdure,\nwhile the ear is soothed by the sweet untutored melody of the countless\nbirds of gay plumage that flit to and fro among the interlacing\nbranches. Here he sees a brook whose limpid waters, like liquid\ncrystal, ripple over fine sands and white pebbles that look like sifted\ngold and purest pearls. There he perceives a cunningly wrought fountain\nof many-coloured jasper and polished marble; here another of rustic\nfashion where the little mussel-shells and the spiral white and yellow\nmansions of the snail disposed in studious disorder, mingled with\nfragments of glittering crystal and mock emeralds, make up a work of\nvaried aspect, where art, imitating nature, seems to have outdone it.\nc50c.jpg (334K)\nFull Size\n\"Suddenly there is presented to his sight a strong castle or gorgeous\npalace with walls of massy gold, turrets of diamond and gates of\njacinth; in short, so marvellous is its structure that though the\nmaterials of which it is built are nothing less than diamonds,\ncarbuncles, rubies, pearls, gold, and emeralds, the workmanship is\nstill more rare. And after having seen all this, what can be more\ncharming than to see how a bevy of damsels comes forth from the gate of\nthe castle in gay and gorgeous attire, such that, were I to set myself\nnow to depict it as the histories describe it to us, I should never\nhave done; and then how she who seems to be the first among them all\ntakes the bold knight who plunged into the boiling lake by the hand,\nand without addressing a word to him leads him into the rich palace or\ncastle, and strips him as naked as when his mother bore him, and bathes\nhim in lukewarm water, and anoints him all over with sweet-smelling\nunguents, and clothes him in a shirt of the softest sendal, all scented\nand perfumed, while another damsel comes and throws over his shoulders\na mantle which is said to be worth at the very least a city, and even\nmore? How charming it is, then, when they tell us how, after all this,\nthey lead him to another chamber where he finds the tables set out in\nsuch style that he is filled with amazement and wonder; to see how they\npour out water for his hands distilled from amber and sweet-scented\nflowers; how they seat him on an ivory chair; to see how the damsels\nwait on him all in profound silence; how they bring him such a variety\nof dainties so temptingly prepared that the appetite is at a loss which\nto select; to hear the music that resounds while he is at table, by\nwhom or whence produced he knows not. And then when the repast is over\nand the tables removed, for the knight to recline in the chair, picking\nhis teeth perhaps as usual, and a damsel, much lovelier than any of the\nothers, to enter unexpectedly by the chamber door, and herself by his\nside, and begin to tell him what the castle is, and how she is held\nenchanted there, and other things that amaze the knight and astonish\nthe readers who are perusing his history.\nc50d.jpg (433K)\nFull Size\n\"But I will not expatiate any further upon this, as it may be gathered\nfrom it that whatever part of whatever history of a knight-errant one\nreads, it will fill the reader, whoever he be, with delight and wonder;\nand take my advice, sir, and, as I said before, read these books and\nyou will see how they will banish any melancholy you may feel and raise\nyour spirits should they be depressed. For myself I can say that since\nI have been a knight-errant I have become valiant, polite, generous,\nwell-bred, magnanimous, courteous, dauntless, gentle, patient, and have\nlearned to bear hardships, imprisonments, and enchantments; and though\nit be such a short time since I have seen myself shut up in a cage like\na madman, I hope by the might of my arm, if heaven aid me and fortune\nthwart me not, to see myself king of some kingdom where I may be able\nto show the gratitude and generosity that dwell in my heart; for by my\nfaith, se\u00f1or, the poor man is incapacitated from showing the virtue of\ngenerosity to anyone, though he may possess it in the highest degree;\nand gratitude that consists of disposition only is a dead thing, just\nas faith without works is dead. For this reason I should be glad were\nfortune soon to offer me some opportunity of making myself an emperor,\nso as to show my heart in doing good to my friends, particularly to\nthis poor Sancho Panza, my squire, who is the best fellow in the world;\nand I would gladly give him a county I have promised him this ever so\nlong, only that I am afraid he has not the capacity to govern his\nrealm.\"",

That's what\nI'll do, and not stand haggling over trifles, but wash my hands at once\nof the whole business, and enjoy my rents like a duke, and let things\ngo their own way.\"\n\"That, brother Sancho,\" said the canon, \"only holds good as far as the\nenjoyment of the revenue goes; but the lord of the seigniory must\nattend to the administration of justice, and here capacity and sound\njudgment come in, and above all a firm determination to find out the\ntruth; for if this be wanting in the beginning, the middle and the end\nwill always go wrong; and God as commonly aids the honest intentions of\nthe simple as he frustrates the evil designs of the crafty.\"\n\"I don't understand those philosophies,\" returned Sancho Panza; \"all I\nknow is I would I had the county as soon as I shall know how to govern\nit; for I have as much soul as another, and as much body as anyone, and\nI shall be as much king of my realm as any other of his; and being so I\nshould do as I liked, and doing as I liked I should please myself, and\npleasing myself I should be content, and when one is content he has\nnothing more to desire, and when one has nothing more to desire there\nis an end of it; so let the county come, and God be with you, and let\nus see one another, as one blind man said to the other.\"\n\"That is not bad philosophy thou art talking, Sancho,\" said the canon;\n\"but for all that there is a good deal to be said on this matter of\ncounties.\"\nTo which Don Quixote returned, \"I know not what more there is to be\nsaid; I only guide myself by the example set me by the great Amadis of\nGaul, when he made his squire count of the Insula Firme; and so,\nwithout any scruples of conscience, I can make a count of Sancho Panza,\nfor he is one of the best squires that ever knight-errant had.\"\nThe canon was astonished at the methodical nonsense (if nonsense be\ncapable of method) that Don Quixote uttered, at the way in which he had\ndescribed the adventure of the knight of the lake, at the impression\nthat the deliberate lies of the books he read had made upon him, and\nlastly he marvelled at the simplicity of Sancho, who desired so eagerly\nto obtain the county his master had promised him.",

As\nthey were eating they suddenly heard a loud noise and the sound of a\nbell that seemed to come from among some brambles and thick bushes that\nwere close by, and the same instant they observed a beautiful goat,\nspotted all over black, white, and brown, spring out of the thicket\nwith a goatherd after it, calling to it and uttering the usual cries to\nmake it stop or turn back to the fold. The fugitive goat, scared and\nfrightened, ran towards the company as if seeking their protection and\nthen stood still, and the goatherd coming up seized it by the horns and\nbegan to talk to it as if it were possessed of reason and\nunderstanding: \"Ah wanderer, wanderer, Spotty, Spotty; how have you\ngone limping all this time? What wolves have frightened you, my\ndaughter? Won't you tell me what is the matter, my beauty? But what\nelse can it be except that you are a she, and cannot keep quiet? A\nplague on your humours and the humours of those you take after! Come\nback, come back, my darling; and if you will not be so happy, at any\nrate you will be safe in the fold or with your companions; for if you\nwho ought to keep and lead them, go wandering astray, what will become\nof them?\"\nThe goatherd's talk amused all who heard it, but especially the canon,\nwho said to him, \"As you live, brother, take it easy, and be not in\nsuch a hurry to drive this goat back to the fold; for, being a female,\nas you say, she will follow her natural instinct in spite of all you\ncan do to prevent it. Take this morsel and drink a sup, and that will\nsoothe your irritation, and in the meantime the goat will rest\nherself,\" and so saying, he handed him the loins of a cold rabbit on a\nfork.\nThe goatherd took it with thanks, and drank and calmed himself, and\nthen said, \"I should be sorry if your worships were to take me for a\nsimpleton for having spoken so seriously as I did to this animal; but\nthe truth is there is a certain mystery in the words I used. I am a\nclown, but not so much of one but that I know how to behave to men and\nto beasts.\"\n\"That I can well believe,\" said the curate, \"for I know already by\nexperience that the woods breed men of learning, and shepherds' huts\nharbour philosophers.\"\n\"At all events, se\u00f1or,\" returned the goatherd, \"they shelter men of\nexperience; and that you may see the truth of this and grasp it, though\nI may seem to put myself forward without being asked, I will, if it\nwill not tire you, gentlemen, and you will give me your attention for a\nlittle, tell you a true story which will confirm this gentleman's word\n(and he pointed to the curate) as well as my own.\"\nTo this Don Quixote replied, \"Seeing that this affair has a certain\ncolour of chivalry about it, I for my part, brother, will hear you most\ngladly, and so will all these gentlemen, from the high intelligence\nthey possess and their love of curious novelties that interest, charm,\nand entertain the mind, as I feel quite sure your story will do. So\nbegin, friend, for we are all prepared to listen.\"\n\"I draw my stakes,\" said Sancho, \"and will retreat with this pasty to\nthe brook there, where I mean to victual myself for three days; for I\nhave heard my lord, Don Quixote, say that a knight-errant's squire\nshould eat until he can hold no more, whenever he has the chance,\nbecause it often happens them to get by accident into a wood so thick\nthat they cannot find a way out of it for six days; and if the man is\nnot well filled or his alforjas well stored, there he may stay, as very\noften he does, turned into a dried mummy.\"\n\"Thou art in the right of it, Sancho,\" said Don Quixote; \"go where thou\nwilt and eat all thou canst, for I have had enough, and only want to\ngive my mind its refreshment, as I shall by listening to this good\nfellow's story.\"\n\"It is what we shall all do,\" said the canon; and then begged the\ngoatherd to begin the promised tale.\nThe goatherd gave the goat which he held by the horns a couple of slaps\non the back, saying, \"Lie down here beside me, Spotty, for we have time\nenough to return to our fold.\" The goat seemed to understand him, for\nas her master seated himself, she stretched herself quietly beside him\nand looked up in his face to show him she was all attention to what he\nwas going to say, and then in these words he began his story.",

But what made him\nstill more fortunate, as he said himself, was having a daughter of such\nexceeding beauty, rare intelligence, gracefulness, and virtue, that\neveryone who knew her and beheld her marvelled at the extraordinary\ngifts with which heaven and nature had endowed her. As a child she was\nbeautiful, she continued to grow in beauty, and at the age of sixteen\nshe was most lovely. The fame of her beauty began to spread abroad\nthrough all the villages around\u2014but why do I say the villages around,\nmerely, when it spread to distant cities, and even made its way into\nthe halls of royalty and reached the ears of people of every class, who\ncame from all sides to see her as if to see something rare and curious,\nor some wonder-working image?\nHer father watched over her and she watched over herself; for there are\nno locks, or guards, or bolts that can protect a young girl better than\nher own modesty. The wealth of the father and the beauty of the\ndaughter led many neighbours as well as strangers to seek her for a\nwife; but he, as one might well be who had the disposal of so rich a\njewel, was perplexed and unable to make up his mind to which of her\ncountless suitors he should entrust her. I was one among the many who\nfelt a desire so natural, and, as her father knew who I was, and I was\nof the same town, of pure blood, in the bloom of life, and very rich in\npossessions, I had great hopes of success. There was another of the\nsame place and qualifications who also sought her, and this made her\nfather's choice hang in the balance, for he felt that on either of us\nhis daughter would be well bestowed; so to escape from this state of\nperplexity he resolved to refer the matter to Leandra (for that is the\nname of the rich damsel who has reduced me to misery), reflecting that\nas we were both equal it would be best to leave it to his dear daughter\nto choose according to her inclination\u2014a course that is worthy of\nimitation by all fathers who wish to settle their children in life. I\ndo not mean that they ought to leave them to make a choice of what is\ncontemptible and bad, but that they should place before them what is\ngood and then allow them to make a good choice as they please. I do not\nknow which Leandra chose; I only know her father put us both off with\nthe tender age of his daughter and vague words that neither bound him\nnor dismissed us. My rival is called Anselmo and I myself Eugenio\u2014that\nyou may know the names of the personages that figure in this tragedy,\nthe end of which is still in suspense, though it is plain to see it\nmust be disastrous.",

A\ncaptain who chanced to pass that way with his company had carried him\noff from our village when he was a boy of about twelve years, and now\ntwelve years later the young man came back in a soldier's uniform,\narrayed in a thousand colours, and all over glass trinkets and fine\nsteel chains. To-day he would appear in one gay dress, to-morrow in\nanother; but all flimsy and gaudy, of little substance and less worth.\nThe peasant folk, who are naturally malicious, and when they have\nnothing to do can be malice itself, remarked all this, and took note of\nhis finery and jewellery, piece by piece, and discovered that he had\nthree suits of different colours, with garters and stockings to match;\nbut he made so many arrangements and combinations out of them, that if\nthey had not counted them, anyone would have sworn that he had made a\ndisplay of more than ten suits of clothes and twenty plumes. Do not\nlook upon all this that I am telling you about the clothes as uncalled\nfor or spun out, for they have a great deal to do with the story. He\nused to seat himself on a bench under the great poplar in our plaza,\nand there he would keep us all hanging open-mouthed on the stories he\ntold us of his exploits. There was no country on the face of the globe\nhe had not seen, nor battle he had not been engaged in; he had killed\nmore Moors than there are in Morocco and Tunis, and fought more single\ncombats, according to his own account, than Garcilaso, Diego Garc\u00eda de\nParedes and a thousand others he named, and out of all he had come\nvictorious without losing a drop of blood. On the other hand he showed\nmarks of wounds, which, though they could not be made out, he said were\ngunshot wounds received in divers encounters and actions. Lastly, with\nmonstrous impudence he used to say \"you\" to his equals and even those\nwho knew what he was, and declare that his arm was his father and his\ndeeds his pedigree, and that being a soldier he was as good as the king\nhimself. And to add to these swaggering ways he was a trifle of a\nmusician, and played the guitar with such a flourish that some said he\nmade it speak; nor did his accomplishments end here, for he was\nsomething of a poet too, and on every trifle that happened in the town\nhe made a ballad a league long.",

Our melancholy grew greater, our patience grew\nless; we cursed the soldier's finery and railed at the carelessness of\nLeandra's father. At last Anselmo and I agreed to leave the village and\ncome to this valley; and, he feeding a great flock of sheep of his own,\nand I a large herd of goats of mine, we pass our life among the trees,\ngiving vent to our sorrows, together singing the fair Leandra's\npraises, or upbraiding her, or else sighing alone, and to heaven\npouring forth our complaints in solitude. Following our example, many\nmore of Leandra's lovers have come to these rude mountains and adopted\nour mode of life, and they are so numerous that one would fancy the\nplace had been turned into the pastoral Arcadia, so full is it of\nshepherds and sheep-folds; nor is there a spot in it where the name of\nthe fair Leandra is not heard. Here one curses her and calls her\ncapricious, fickle, and immodest, there another condemns her as frail\nand frivolous; this pardons and absolves her, that spurns and reviles\nher; one extols her beauty, another assails her character, and in short\nall abuse her, and all adore her, and to such a pitch has this general\ninfatuation gone that there are some who complain of her scorn without\never having exchanged a word with her, and even some that bewail and\nmourn the raging fever of jealousy, for which she never gave anyone\ncause, for, as I have already said, her misconduct was known before her\npassion. There is no nook among the rocks, no brookside, no shade\nbeneath the trees that is not haunted by some shepherd telling his woes\nto the breezes; wherever there is an echo it repeats the name of\nLeandra; the mountains ring with \"Leandra,\" \"Leandra\" murmur the\nbrooks, and Leandra keeps us all bewildered and bewitched, hoping\nwithout hope and fearing without knowing what we fear. Of all this\nsilly set the one that shows the least and also the most sense is my\nrival Anselmo, for having so many other things to complain of, he only\ncomplains of separation, and to the accompaniment of a rebeck, which he\nplays admirably, he sings his complaints in verses that show his\ningenuity. I follow another, easier, and to my mind wiser course, and\nthat is to rail at the frivolity of women, at their inconstancy, their\ndouble dealing, their broken promises, their unkept pledges, and in\nshort the want of reflection they show in fixing their affections and\ninclinations. This, sirs, was the reason of words and expressions I\nmade use of to this goat when I came up just now; for as she is a\nfemale I have a contempt for her, though she is the best in all my\nfold. This is the story I promised to tell you, and if I have been\ntedious in telling it, I will not be slow to serve you; my hut is close",

They all offered their services to\nEugenio but he who showed himself most liberal in this way was Don\nQuixote, who said to him, \"Most assuredly, brother goatherd, if I found\nmyself in a position to attempt any adventure, I would, this very\ninstant, set out on your behalf, and would rescue Leandra from that\nconvent (where no doubt she is kept against her will), in spite of the\nabbess and all who might try to prevent me, and would place her in your\nhands to deal with her according to your will and pleasure, observing,\nhowever, the laws of chivalry which lay down that no violence of any\nkind is to be offered to any damsel. But I trust in God our Lord that\nthe might of one malignant enchanter may not prove so great but that\nthe power of another better disposed may prove superior to it, and then\nI promise you my support and assistance, as I am bound to do by my\nprofession, which is none other than to give aid to the weak and\nneedy.\"\nThe goatherd eyed him, and noticing Don Quixote's sorry appearance and\nlooks, he was filled with wonder, and asked the barber, who was next\nhim, \"Se\u00f1or, who is this man who makes such a figure and talks in such\na strain?\"\n\"Who should it be,\" said the barber, \"but the famous Don Quixote of La\nMancha, the undoer of injustice, the righter of wrongs, the protector\nof damsels, the terror of giants, and the winner of battles?\"\n\"That,\" said the goatherd, \"sounds like what one reads in the books of\nthe knights-errant, who did all that you say this man does; though it\nis my belief that either you are joking, or else this gentleman has\nempty lodgings in his head.\"\n\"You are a great scoundrel,\" said Don Quixote, \"and it is you who are\nempty and a fool. I am fuller than ever was the whoreson bitch that\nbore you;\" and passing from words to deeds, he caught up a loaf that\nwas near him and sent it full in the goatherd's face, with such force\nthat he flattened his nose; but the goatherd, who did not understand\njokes, and found himself roughly handled in such good earnest, paying\nno respect to carpet, tablecloth, or diners, sprang upon Don Quixote,\nand seizing him by the throat with both hands would no doubt have\nthrottled him, had not Sancho Panza that instant come to the rescue,\nand grasping him by the shoulders flung him down on the table, smashing\nplates, breaking glasses, and upsetting and scattering everything on\nit. Don Quixote, finding himself free, strove to get on top of the\ngoatherd, who, with his face covered with blood, and soundly kicked by\nSancho, was on all fours feeling about for one of the table-knives to\ntake a bloody revenge with. The canon and the curate, however,\nprevented him, but the barber so contrived it that he got Don Quixote\nunder him, and rained down upon him such a shower of fisticuffs that\nthe poor knight's face streamed with blood as freely as his own. The\ncanon and the curate were bursting with laughter, the officers were\ncapering with delight, and both the one and the other hissed them on as\nthey do dogs that are worrying one another in a fight. Sancho alone was\nfrantic, for he could not free himself from the grasp of one of the\ncanon's servants, who kept him from going to his master's assistance.\nc52b.jpg (348K)\nFull Size\nAt last, while they were all, with the exception of the two bruisers\nwho were mauling each other, in high glee and enjoyment, they heard a\ntrumpet sound a note so doleful that it made them all look in the\ndirection whence the sound seemed to come. But the one that was most\nexcited by hearing it was Don Quixote, who though sorely against his\nwill he was under the goatherd, and something more than pretty well\npummelled, said to him, \"Brother devil (for it is impossible but that\nthou must be one since thou hast had might and strength enough to\novercome mine), I ask thee to agree to a truce for but one hour for the\nsolemn note of yonder trumpet that falls on our ears seems to me to\nsummon me to some new adventure.\" The goatherd, who was by this time\ntired of pummelling and being pummelled, released him at once, and Don\nQuixote rising to his feet and turning his eyes to the quarter where\nthe sound had been heard, suddenly saw coming down the slope of a hill\nseveral men clad in white like penitents.\nThe fact was that the clouds had that year withheld their moisture from\nthe earth, and in all the villages of the district they were organising\nprocessions, rogations, and penances, imploring God to open the hands\nof his mercy and send the rain; and to this end the people of a village\nthat was hard by were going in procession to a holy hermitage there was\non one side of that valley. Don Quixote when he saw the strange garb of\nthe penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took\nit into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to\nhim alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more\nconfirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black\nthey had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and\ndiscourteous thieves were carrying off by force. As soon as this\noccurred to him he ran with all speed to Rocinante who was grazing at\nlarge, and taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he\nhad him bridled in an instant, and calling to Sancho for his sword he\nmounted Rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice\nexclaimed to those who stood by, \"Now, noble company, ye shall see how\nimportant it is that there should be knights in the world professing\nthe order of knight-errantry; now, I say, ye shall see, by the\ndeliverance of that worthy lady who is borne captive there, whether\nknights-errant deserve to be held in estimation,\" and so saying he\nbrought his legs to bear on Rocinante\u2014for he had no spurs\u2014and at a full\ncanter (for in all this veracious history we never read of Rocinante\nfairly galloping) set off to encounter the penitents, though the\ncurate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent him. But it was out of\ntheir power, nor did he even stop for the shouts of Sancho calling\nafter him, \"Where are you going, Se\u00f1or Don Quixote? What devils have\npossessed you to set you on against our Catholic faith? Plague take me!\nmind, that is a procession of penitents, and the lady they are carrying\non that stand there is the blessed image of the immaculate Virgin. Take\ncare what you are doing, se\u00f1or, for this time it may be safely said you\ndon't know what you are about.\" Sancho laboured in vain, for his master\nwas so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted figures and\nreleasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and even had\nhe heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered him. He\ncame up with the procession and reined in Rocinante, who was already\nanxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse, excited\nvoice he exclaimed, \"You who hide your faces, perhaps because you are\nnot good subjects, pay attention and listen to what I am about to say\nto you.\" The first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and\none of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the Litany, struck by\nthe strange figure of Don Quixote, the leanness of Rocinante, and the\nother ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply to him,\n\"Brother, if you have anything to say to us say it quickly, for these\nbrethren are whipping themselves, and we cannot stop, nor is it\nreasonable we should stop to hear anything, unless indeed it is short\nenough to be said in two words.\"\n\"I will say it in one,\" replied Don Quixote, \"and it is this; that at\nonce, this very instant, ye release that fair lady whose tears and sad\naspect show plainly that ye are carrying her off against her will, and\nthat ye have committed some scandalous outrage against her; and I, who\nwas born into the world to redress all such like wrongs, will not\npermit you to advance another step until you have restored to her the\nliberty she pines for and deserves.\"\nFrom these words all the hearers concluded that he must be a madman,\nand began to laugh heartily, and their laughter acted like gunpowder on\nDon Quixote's fury, for drawing his sword without another word he made\na rush at the stand. One of those who supported it, leaving the burden\nto his comrades, advanced to meet him, flourishing a forked stick that\nhe had for propping up the stand when resting, and with this he caught\na mighty cut Don Quixote made at him that severed it in two; but with\nthe portion that remained in his hand he dealt such a thwack on the\nshoulder of Don Quixote's sword arm (which the buckler could not\nprotect against the clownish assault) that poor Don Quixote came to the\nground in a sad plight.\nSancho Panza, who was coming on close behind puffing and blowing,\nseeing him fall, cried out to his assailant not to strike him again,\nfor he was a poor enchanted knight, who had never harmed anyone all the\ndays of his life; but what checked the clown was, not Sancho's\nshouting, but seeing that Don Quixote did not stir hand or foot; and\nso, fancying he had killed him, he hastily hitched up his tunic under\nhis girdle and took to his heels across the country like a deer.\nBy this time all Don Quixote's companions had come up to where he lay;\nbut the processionists seeing them come running, and with them the\nofficers of the Brotherhood with their crossbows, apprehended mischief,\nand clustering round the image, raised their hoods, and grasped their\nscourges, as the priests did their tapers, and awaited the attack,\nresolved to defend themselves and even to take the offensive against\ntheir assailants if they could. Fortune, however, arranged the matter\nbetter than they expected, for all Sancho did was to fling himself on\nhis master's body, raising over him the most doleful and laughable\nlamentation that ever was heard, for he believed he was dead. The\ncurate was known to another curate who walked in the procession, and\ntheir recognition of one another set at rest the apprehensions of both\nparties; the first then told the other in two words who Don Quixote\nwas, and he and the whole troop of penitents went to see if the poor\ngentleman was dead, and heard Sancho Panza saying, with tears in his\neyes, \"Oh flower of chivalry, that with one blow of a stick hast ended\nthe course of thy well-spent life! Oh pride of thy race, honour and\nglory of all La Mancha, nay, of all the world, that for want of thee\nwill be full of evil-doers, no longer in fear of punishment for their\nmisdeeds! Oh thou, generous above all the Alexanders, since for only\neight months of service thou hast given me the best island the sea\ngirds or surrounds! Humble with the proud, haughty with the humble,\nencounterer of dangers, endurer of outrages, enamoured without reason,\nimitator of the good, scourge of the wicked, enemy of the mean, in\nshort, knight-errant, which is all that can be said!\"\nc52c.jpg (325K)\nFull Size\nAt the cries and moans of Sancho, Don Quixote came to himself, and the\nfirst word he said was, \"He who lives separated from you, sweetest\nDulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. Aid me, friend\nSancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for I am not in a condition to\npress the saddle of Rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to\npieces.\"\n\"That I will do with all my heart, se\u00f1or,\" said Sancho; \"and let us\nreturn to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and\nthere we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more\nprofitable and creditable to us.\"\n\"Thou art right, Sancho,\" returned Don Quixote; \"It will be wise to let\nthe malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off.\"\nThe canon, the curate, and the barber told him he would act very wisely\nin doing as he said; and so, highly amused at Sancho Panza's\nsimplicities, they placed Don Quixote in the cart as before. The\nprocession once more formed itself in order and proceeded on its road;\nthe goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the\nBrotherhood declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what\nwas due to them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how Don\nQuixote did, whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from\nit, and then begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all",

            "text": "of six days they reached Don Quixote's village, and entered it about\nthe middle of the day, which it so happened was a Sunday, and the\npeople were all in the plaza, through which Don Quixote's cart passed.\nThey all flocked to see what was in the cart, and when they recognised\ntheir townsman they were filled with amazement, and a boy ran off to\nbring the news to his housekeeper and his niece that their master and\nuncle had come back all lean and yellow and stretched on a truss of hay\non an ox-cart. It was piteous to hear the cries the two good ladies\nraised, how they beat their breasts and poured out fresh maledictions\non those accursed books of chivalry; all which was renewed when they\nsaw Don Quixote coming in at the gate.\nAt the news of Don Quixote's arrival Sancho Panza's wife came running,\nfor she by this time knew that her husband had gone away with him as\nhis squire, and on seeing Sancho, the first thing she asked him was if\nthe ass was well. Sancho replied that he was, better than his master\nwas.\n\"Thanks be to God,\" said she, \"for being so good to me; but now tell\nme, my friend, what have you made by your squirings? What gown have you\nbrought me back? What shoes for your children?\"\n\"I bring nothing of that sort, wife,\" said Sancho; \"though I bring\nother things of more consequence and value.\"\n\"I am very glad of that,\" returned his wife; \"show me these things of\nmore value and consequence, my friend; for I want to see them to cheer\nmy heart that has been so sad and heavy all these ages that you have\nbeen away.\"\n\"I will show them to you at home, wife,\" said Sancho; \"be content for\nthe present; for if it please God that we should again go on our\ntravels in search of adventures, you will soon see me a count, or\ngovernor of an island, and that not one of those everyday ones, but the\nbest that is to be had.\"\n\"Heaven grant it, husband,\" said she, \"for indeed we have need of it.\nBut tell me, what's this about islands, for I don't understand it?\"\n\"Honey is not for the mouth of the ass,\" returned Sancho; \"all in good\ntime thou shalt see, wife\u2014nay, thou wilt be surprised to hear thyself\ncalled 'your ladyship' by all thy vassals.\"\n\"What are you talking about, Sancho, with your ladyships, islands, and\nvassals?\" returned Teresa Panza\u2014for so Sancho's wife was called, though\nthey were not relations, for in La Mancha it is customary for wives to\ntake their husbands' surnames.\n\"Don't be in such a hurry to know all this, Teresa,\" said Sancho; \"it\nis enough that I am telling you the truth, so shut your mouth. But I\nmay tell you this much by the way, that there is nothing in the world\nmore delightful than to be a person of consideration, squire to a\nknight-errant, and a seeker of adventures. To be sure most of those one\nfinds do not end as pleasantly as one could wish, for out of a hundred,\nninety-nine will turn out cross and contrary. I know it by experience,\nfor out of some I came blanketed, and out of others belaboured. Still,\nfor all that, it is a fine thing to be on the look-out for what may\nhappen, crossing mountains, searching woods, climbing rocks, visiting\ncastles, putting up at inns, all at free quarters, and devil take the\nmaravedi to pay.\"\nWhile this conversation passed between Sancho Panza and his wife, Don\nQuixote's housekeeper and niece took him in and undressed him and laid\nhim in his old bed. He eyed them askance, and could not make out where\nhe was. The curate charged his niece to be very careful to make her\nuncle comfortable and to keep a watch over him lest he should make his\nescape from them again, telling her what they had been obliged to do to\nbring him home. On this the pair once more lifted up their voices and\nrenewed their maledictions upon the books of chivalry, and implored\nheaven to plunge the authors of such lies and nonsense into the midst\nof the bottomless pit. They were, in short, kept in anxiety and dread\nlest their uncle and master should give them the slip the moment he\nfound himself somewhat better, and as they feared so it fell out.\nBut the author of this history, though he has devoted research and\nindustry to the discovery of the deeds achieved by Don Quixote in his\nthird sally, has been unable to obtain any information respecting them,\nat any rate derived from authentic documents; tradition has merely\npreserved in the memory of La Mancha the fact that Don Quixote, the\nthird time he sallied forth from his home, betook himself to Saragossa,\nwhere he was present at some famous jousts which came off in that city,\nand that he had adventures there worthy of his valour and high\nintelligence. Of his end and death he could learn no particulars, nor\nwould he have ascertained it or known of it, if good fortune had not\nproduced an old physician for him who had in his possession a leaden\nbox, which, according to his account, had been discovered among the\ncrumbling foundations of an ancient hermitage that was being rebuilt;\nin which box were found certain parchment manuscripts in Gothic\ncharacter, but in Castilian verse, containing many of his achievements,\nand setting forth the beauty of Dulcinea, the form of Rocinante, the\nfidelity of Sancho Panza, and the burial of Don Quixote himself,\ntogether with sundry epitaphs and eulogies on his life and character;\nbut all that could be read and deciphered were those which the\ntrustworthy author of this new and unparalleled history here presents.\nAnd the said author asks of those that shall read it nothing in return\nfor the vast toil which it has cost him in examining and searching the\nManchegan archives in order to bring it to light, save that they give\nhim the same credit that people of sense give to the books of chivalry\nthat pervade the world and are so popular; for with this he will\nconsider himself amply paid and fully satisfied, and will be encouraged\nto seek out and produce other histories, if not as truthful, at least\nequal in invention and not less entertaining. The first words written\non the parchment found in the leaden box were these:\nTHE ACADEMICIANS OF ARGAMASILLA,\nA VILLAGE OF LA MANCHA,\nON THE LIFE AND DEATH OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA,\nHOC SCRIPSERUNT\nMONICONGO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE\nEPITAPH\nThe scatterbrain that gave La Mancha more\nRich spoils than Jason's; who a point so keen\nHad to his wit, and happier far had been\nIf his wit's weathercock a blunter bore;\nThe arm renowned far as Gaeta's shore,\nCathay, and all the lands that lie between;\nThe muse discreet and terrible in mien\nAs ever wrote on brass in days of yore;\nHe who surpassed the Amadises all,\nAnd who as naught the Galaors accounted,\nSupported by his love and gallantry:\nWho made the Belianises sing small,\nAnd sought renown on Rocinante mounted;\nHere, underneath this cold stone, doth he lie.\nPANIAGUADO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nIN LAUDEM DULCINEAE DEL TOBOSO\nSONNET\nShe, whose full features may be here descried,\nHigh-bosomed, with a bearing of disdain,\nIs Dulcinea, she for whom in vain\nThe great Don Quixote of La Mancha sighed.\nFor her, Toboso's queen, from side to side\nHe traversed the grim sierra, the champaign\nOf Aranjuez, and Montiel's famous plain:\nOn Rocinante oft a weary ride.\nMalignant planets, cruel destiny,\nPursued them both, the fair Manchegan dame,\nAnd the unconquered star of chivalry.\nNor youth nor beauty saved her from the claim\nOf death; he paid love's bitter penalty,\nAnd left the marble to preserve his name.\nCAPRICHOSO, A MOST ACUTE ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nIN PRAISE OF ROCINANTE, STEED OF DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA\nSONNET\nOn that proud throne of diamantine sheen,\nWhich the blood-reeking feet of Mars degrade,\nThe mad Manchegan's banner now hath been\nBy him in all its bravery displayed.\nThere hath he hung his arms and trenchant blade\nWherewith, achieving deeds till now unseen,\nHe slays, lays low, cleaves, hews; but art hath made\nA novel style for our new paladin.\nIf Amadis be the proud boast of Gaul,\nIf by his progeny the fame of Greece\nThrough all the regions of the earth be spread,\nGreat Quixote crowned in grim Bellona's hall\nTo-day exalts La Mancha over these,\nAnd above Greece or Gaul she holds her head.\nNor ends his glory here, for his good steed\nDoth Brillador and Bayard far exceed;\nAs mettled steeds compared with Rocinante,\nThe reputation they have won is scanty.\nBURLADOR, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nON SANCHO PANZA\nSONNET\nThe worthy Sancho Panza here you see;\nA great soul once was in that body small,\nNor was there squire upon this earthly ball\nSo plain and simple, or of guile so free.\nWithin an ace of being Count was he,\nAnd would have been but for the spite and gall\nOf this vile age, mean and illiberal,\nThat cannot even let a donkey be.\nFor mounted on an ass (excuse the word),\nBy Rocinante's side this gentle squire\nWas wont his wandering master to attend.\nDelusive hopes that lure the common herd\nWith promises of ease, the heart's desire,\nIn shadows, dreams, and smoke ye always end.\nCACHIDIABLO, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nON THE TOMB OF DON QUIXOTE\nEPITAPH\nThe knight lies here below,\nIll-errant and bruised sore,\nWhom Rocinante bore\nIn his wanderings to and fro.\nBy the side of the knight is laid\nStolid man Sancho too,\nThan whom a squire more true\nWas not in the esquire trade.\nTIQUITOC, ACADEMICIAN OF ARGAMASILLA,\nON THE TOMB OF DULCINEA DEL TOBOSO\nEPITAPH\nHere Dulcinea lies.\nPlump was she and robust:\nNow she is ashes and dust:\nThe end of all flesh that dies.\nA lady of high degree,\nWith the port of a lofty dame,\nAnd the great Don Quixote's flame,\nAnd the pride of her village was she.\nThese were all the verses that could be deciphered; the rest, the\nwriting being worm-eaten, were handed over to one of the Academicians\nto make out their meaning conjecturally.
