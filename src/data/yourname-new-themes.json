Her expression was serious, even grave, as\nif the fate of the universe rested in her hands.\nStill, it was just a dream. It doesn't mean anything.

I look down at my body and see cleavage.\nCleavage.\nThe soft mounds reflect the morning sun, and the pale, smooth skin gleams.\nA deep-blue shadow lies between the two breasts, like a lake.\nMight as well squeeze 'em , I think, without missing a beat.\nMy hands gravitate toward them as naturally as an apple falling to the\nground.\n. ?\n...!\nThe sensation blows my mind. Whoa, I think. What is this? I keep kneading\nearnestly. This is just... Wow... Girls' bodies are amazing...\n\"Sis? What're you doin'?\"\nI glance in the direction of the voice. There's a little girl standing there.\nShe's just opened a sliding door. With my hands still pressed against my chest,\nI give her my honest impression.\n\"I was just thinking these feel way real... Huh?\"\nI look at the kid again. She's about ten, with twin ponytails and sharp eyes,\nand she looks like the sassy type.\n.. 'Sis'?\" I ask the girl, pointing at myself.\nSo that means this is my kid sister? The girl looks thoroughly appalled.\n\"You still asleep or somethin'? It's. Break. Fast. Time! Hurry up!\"\nShe slams the sliding door shut with a sharp thwack. Fierce little girl, I\nthink, hauling myself off the futon. Come to think of it, I am hungry. Suddenly, a\nfull-length mirror in the corner of my vision catches my eye. I walk a few steps\nacross the tatami mats decorating the floor to stand in front of it. Letting my\nloose nightshirt slip off my shoulders and fall to the floor leaves me naked. I\nstare at my full-length reflection in the mirror.\nLong black hair flows down my back, although it's sleep-tousled and\nsticking up in places. A small, round face holds big, curious eyes and lips that\nseem vaguely amused above a slim neck, deep collarbone, and a swelling\nbosom that seems to proclaim, Why yes, thank you, Fm quite healthy! Below\nare faint shadows of ribs, and then the soft curves of the waist.\nI haven't seen one in the flesh yet, but this is definitely a girl's body.\n...A girl?\nI'm...a girl?\nAbruptly, the drowsy fog enveloping my body is gone. My head clears\ninstantly, then plunges into confusion.\nI can't take it, and I scream.",

I can't show weakness by\napologizing! I think, opening the rice cooker and scooping a gleaming white\nhelping into my bowl. Whoops, is that too much? Well, never mind.\n\"Thanks for the food!\"\nI pour a generous dose of sauce over a smooth fried egg, pair it with rice,\nand put it in my mouth. Oh, yum. This just might be paradise... Hmm? I feel\neyes trained on me, somewhere around my temple.\n\"So you're normal today, are you?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nGran is watching me steadily as I chew my food.\n\"She sure was somethin' else yesterday!\" Yotsuha smirks at me. \"Screamin'\nall of a sudden like that.\"\nScreaming? Gran inspects me suspiciously, and Yotsuha grins (mocking me,\nI'm sure).\n\"Huh? What? What do you mean? What?!\"\nSeriously, what's the matter with them? It's creepy.\nDing-dong-ding-do oong.\nSuddenly, the speaker over the door comes alive, deafeningly loud.\n\"Good morning, everyone.\"\nThe voice belongs to my friend Saya's big sister (currently employed by the\nRegional Life Information Section at the town hall). This place, Itomori, is a\ndinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either\nknow each other or at least know someone in common.\n\"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori.\"\nThe slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. \"Here\nare...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori.\" There are speakers\noutside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and\noverlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.\nTwice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast\nplays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the\ndaily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how\nto contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,\ntoday's funerals.\n\"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on\nthe twentieth of next month, the town election management committee\nhas\u2014\"\nClick.\nThe speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's\npulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but\neven so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by\nher chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.\nPicking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts\nspeaking.\n\"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only\nonce every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be\nvisible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the\ncorner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation\nto study it.\"\nThere's a line of text on the screen \u2014Comet Tiamat visible to the naked\neye next month \u2014and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its\nmomentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and\nthe NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like\nwhispered chatter during class.\n\"... Just make up with him already, wouldja?\"\nOut of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.\n\"It's an adult problem,\" I snap at her.\nThat's right\u2014this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the\nwind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.\nSaying bye to Gran in unison, Yotsuha and I head out the door.",

      "text": "The summer copper pheasants are crowing up a storm.\nTraveling down the narrow paved path that runs along the hillside and\ndescending several stone-walled stairways, we emerge from the shadow of the\nmountain into direct sunlight. Below us is a round lake, Itomori Lake. Its calm\nsurface reflects the morning sun, glittering and glaring as though nobody's\nwatching. The deep-green mountains form their ranks under white clouds in a\nblue sky, and a little girl with pigtails and a red school backpack skips along\nfor no reason. Then there's me beside her, the dazzling, bare-legged high\nschool girl. In my head, I try adding a grand string score to the scene as\nbackground music. Ooh, it's just like the opening of a Japanese film... In other\nwords, we live in the boonies\u2014very Japanese and a few decades behind the\ntimes.\n\"Miiitsuhaaa!\"\nAfter Yotsuha and I part ways in front of the elementary school, a voice\ncalls out from behind me. It's Tesshi, pedaling his bike and looking cranky,\nwith Saya seated primly on the bike rack and smiling.\n\"Hurry up and get off,\" Tesshi grumbles.\n\"I'm fine right here. Don't be stingy!\"\n\"C'mon, you're heavy.\"\n\"And you're rude!\"\nThis early in the morning, and they're already teasing each other like a\nmarried couple in a comedy skit.\n\"You two get along so well.\"\n\"We do not!\" they chorus.\nThey deny it so earnestly it's funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack\nswitches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a\ngood ten years\u2014petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and\ntall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look\nlike they're fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly\nsynced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.\n\"Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today.\"\nSaya, who's gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,\ngrinning. My hair's fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied\ntogether in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.\n\"Huh? What about my hair?\"\nHer comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in\nthe shuffle at breakfast. I did it \"properly\" today\u2014does that mean it was weird\nyesterday? As I'm trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking\nconcerned. \"Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn't you?\"\n\"Exorcise?\"\n\"Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!\"\n\".. .Excuse me?\" I frown at the unexpected remark.\nSaya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. \"Would you quit blamin'\neverythin' on the occult already?! Mitsuha's probably just stressed, that's all.\nRight?\"\nStressed?\n\"Huh? Wait, hold it\u2014what's all this about?\"\nWhy is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can't\nremember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it was just a regular day.\n...Hmm?\nWait, was it really? Yesterday, I...\n\"\u2014And most importantly!\"\nA deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.\nOn the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little\ncrowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal\nparking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and\nbolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit\njacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent\u2014Toshiki Miyamizu. He's stumping for\nthe mayoral election.\n\"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the\nvillage restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we\nbe able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I\nintend to refine the community planning I've been involved with and see it\nthrough to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,\ncreating a local society in which everyone\u2014from our children to our senior\ncitizens\u2014can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my\nresolve to make this vision my goal...\"\nIt's such a skillful speech that it's almost overbearing. It leaves me cold\u2014\nthis campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot\nsurrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd\u2014 \"You know it's\ngonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, \" \"It sounds like he s been\nspreadin ' lots of cash around\" \u2014make my mood even darker.\n\"Hey, Miyamizu.\"\n\"...Mornin'.\"\nWonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I'm less than fond of.\nEven in high school, they're part of the flashy \"in-crowd,\" and they snark at us\n\u2014the \"drones\"\u2014over every little thing.\n\"The mayor and the contractor,\" one of them says, shooting a deliberate\nglance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi's dad standing next\nto mine, beaming. He's wearing a jacket from his construction company and an\narmband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.\nThe guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. \"Their kids are all\nbuddy-buddy, too. Did your folks tell you to hang out together?\"\nThis is so stupid. I don't even answer\u2014I walk faster, trying to get out of\nthere. Tesshi's expressionless. Only Saya looks bothered and a bit flustered.\n\"Mitsuha!\"\nSuddenly, a loud voice booms out. Yeep! My breath catches in my throat. I\ndon't believe this. My dad lowered his mic midspeech to shout at me without\nthe aid of electronic amplification. The whole crowd turns to look at me.\n\"Mitsuha, straighten up!\"\nI turn beet red. It's so unfair that I almost start crying. I want to run, but I\ndesperately fight back the urge and stride away instead.\nThe crowd is whispering. \"He's even tough on family.\"\n\"That's the mayor for you.\"\nI hear my classmates snickering. \"Ooh. Harsh.\"\n\"I kinda feel a little sorry for her.\"\nThis could not be worse.\nThe background music that was playing in my head a minute ago has\ndisappeared, and I remember that this town, without a soundtrack, is an\nabsolutely suffocating place.",

I know twilight, of\ncourse, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was\nlittle is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently.

Excuse me? Seriously, what is\ngoing on?!\n\"You don't remember?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"For real?\"\n\"Yes, for real,\" I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's\nlooking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.\n\".. .No, listen.

There's one train every\ntwo hours, buses come through only twice each day, we don't get weather\nreports for our area, and we're still a mosaic on the Google Maps satellite\nphotos.

Tonight, I must perform my awful\nduty, but I hope you can enjoy your youth.\n\"Awww, I wanna do it, too,\" Yotsuha grumbles.\n\"It's too soon for you yet, Yotsuha,\" hushes Gran.\nThe constant click of spherical weights knocking together echoes in a\nworkroom big enough for only about eight tatami mats. \"Listen to the voice of\nthe thread,\" Gran tells her. Even as she speaks, her hands don't pause in their\nwork. \"If you keep windin' threads that way, before long, emotions will start\nrunnin' between you and the thread.\"\n\"Huh? But thread doesn't talk.\"\n\"Our braided cords\u2014,\" Gran continues, ignoring Yotsuha's objection. All\nthree of us are wearing kimonos, and we're finishing up the cords that we'll\nuse in tonight's ceremony.\nBraided cords are made of thin threads plaited together into a single rope.\nIt's a traditional folk art that's been handed down for a very long time. The\nfinished cords are cute and colorful, with all sorts of designs braided into\nthem. That said, the work takes quite a bit of skill, so Gran's making Yotsuha's\nfor her. Yotsuha's spending the time doing assistant work, winding thread\naround the ball-weights.\n\"Our braided cords hold a thousand years of Itomori's history. I tell you,\nthat school of yours really should put priority on teachin' this sort of town\nhistory to you children. Listen, two hundred years ago...\"\nHere we go again, I think with a wry little smile. It's Gran's favorite\nspeech, and I've heard it over and over in this workroom, ever since I was\nsmall.\n\"A fire began in the bathroom of Mayugorou Yamazaki, the straw sandal-\nmaker, and it burned up this whole area, including the shrine and all the old\nrecords.

The meanin' in those shapes is bound\nto resurface someday.\"\nGran's words have a unique rhythm to them, like a traditional ballad, and as\nI braid my cord, I mouth the words along with her, silently reciting them from\nmemory. The meanin ' in those shapes is bound to resurface someday. Here,\nat Miyamizu Shrine \u2014\n\"Here, at Miyamizu Shrine, that's our solemn duty. And yet...\"\nAt that point, Gran lowers her mild eyes, sadly.\n\"And yet, that foolish son of mine...

For a little while now, I've been\nperforming a ceremonial shrine maiden dance, feeling gloomy enough that I\nwish a killer like Jason or Jack the Ripper\u2014anybody really\u2014would just put\nme out of my misery.\nThis time every year, the Miyamizu Shrine holds its harvest festival, and\nYotsuha and I have the misfortune of being the stars of the show. On this day,\nwe wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear\njingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura\nhall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose\nmeaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.\nWe're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,\ntwirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.\nDuring my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and\ngot even more depressed. Those little\u2014 I told them and told them not to come,\nand they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text\nthem tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.\nSure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,\nI'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's\nmore embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The\npart that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.\nOh, for the love of\u2014\nI don't wanna!\nPlagued by these thoughts, I move my body, and then all of a sudden, the\ndance ends. Agh. Here it comes.\nMunch, munch, munch.\nMunch.\nMunch, munch, munch, munch.\nI'm intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to\nthink, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha's doing\nthe exact same thing. We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small\nwooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,\na diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.\nMunch, munch, munch.\nMunch, munch.\nAgh, I swear...\nMunch, munch, munch.\nI'm going to have to do it soon.\nMunch, munch.\nArrrgh.\nMunch.\nGiving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,\nattempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.\nAnd then. Aaagh.\nPuckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The\nmixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I\nfeel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.\nPlease, nobody look at me.\nMouth-brewed sake.\nIt's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with\nsaliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to\nthe gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I\ndon't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first\ncentury... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!\nI mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice\nand put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the\nexact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over\nand over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.\nInside, I'm crying my eyes out.\nAbruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a\nfaint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.\nCurses.\nI want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It's my three flashy\n\"in-crowd\" classmates. They're watching me with smirks on their faces and\ngleefully gossiping about something. There's too much distance between us for\nme to really hear them but I feel as though I'm hearing them loud and clear.\nEeeeee, I could never, ever do that! and That s kinda obscene, and Man, how\ncan she do that in public? Nobody's ever gonna marry her now.\nI make a very, very firm resolution:\nWhen I graduate, I am leaving this town and going far away.",

Gran was\nthe hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.\n\"How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see...

Sixty?\"\n\"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!\"\n\"Huh.\"\n\"Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.\nThey're in the final stage of life.

She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,\nshe's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving\nup, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,\nshining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.\n\"...That's it!\"\nAs we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha\nsuddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a\ncake someone hid from her.\n\"Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay\nyour way to Tokyo?!\"\nFor a moment, I'm speechless.\n\".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that.\"\n\"You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and\ncall it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!\"\nShould I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?\nStill, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she\nreally is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I'll\ngive this sake business idea some serious thought... Wait, can you just sell\nsake on your own like that?\n\"Well? What do you think, Sis?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n.. .And that's all I have to say.\n\".. .Wait, no! It'd be against the liquor laws!\"\nWait, was that the problem? I wonder, and when I come back to myself,\nI've broken into a run.

      "text": "little while now, Fve been trying\u2014and failing\u2014to find an opportunity to speak\nto her. Her long hair has a soft wave to it. From the side, it hides her eyes, and\nI can't read her expression. Still, her lustrous, glossy lips are curved into a\ngentle smile. Her arms and legs are slender, and her waist is very small\u2014and\nyet she's got big boobs. She's just incredibly cool somehow. Passing her, I\ncatch a glimpse of the name tag on that proud bosom. It reads Okudera.\nPerfect!\n\"Miss Okudera?\"\nJust as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the\nhead.\n\"That's senpai to you!\" The guy who poked me sounds like he's joking. He\ngoes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got\nseniority on me. Okay!\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really...\"\n\"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?\"\nAs she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes\ncurve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of\nbeauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel\ncompelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look\ndown.\n\"Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just...\"\n\"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let\nhim have his food for free, but...\"\nShe doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping\ndown another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...\n\"Eek! Okudera-senpai!\"\nAnother waitress cries out.\n\"Your skirt!\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nMiss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now\nthat I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a\nshocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?\"\n\"I think something like that's happened before...\"\n\"Was someone harassing you?\"\n\"Do you remember the guy's face?\"\nSeveral staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.\nEyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the\nwords I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I\nsee little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.\nThis time, I need to rescue her.\nThe thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,\nI've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my\nback (\"Hey! Taki, you little...\"), but I ignore them.\nThe green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at\nleast one more design element. The brown is\u2014 Sure, it'll be a hedgehog. The\ncream is for its nose.\nPinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For\nsome reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing\nroom sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate\nrepair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly\ngood at.\n\"All done!\"\nI hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to\nfinish.\n\"...Huh? This is...\"\nThe dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing\nroom quickly shifts to surprise.\n\"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!\"\nThe tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so\nas I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.\nThe skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought\nbeing a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like\nOkudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but\nwhen she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the\nneighborhood.\n\"You really saved me today. Thank you very much.\"\nI finally managed to say it.\n\"Heh-heh!\" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.\n\"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but\nyou're always so quick to fight.\"\nAs she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I\ngrasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.\n\"I like this version of you better,\" Okudera-senpai says, a bit\nmischievously. \"You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki.\"\nMy heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing. Her smile is absolutely unbeatable. It\nmakes me want to give her everything I have for free. I think it's the most",

      "text": "The yellow train I take to get home is empty.\nBy now, I've realized that Tokyo is filled with all sorts of scents.\nConvenience stores, family restaurants, the people I pass, the edge of the park,\nconstruction sites, the station at night, the inside of the train... Almost every ten\nsteps, the aromas change. I never knew human beings had such pronounced\nsmells when gathered in one place.\nAnd for every lighted window that skims past my vision, there's a person\nliving in this city. My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that\nstretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the\noverwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.\nTaki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand\ntoward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but\nI guess I don't hate it. I'm starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,\nas if he's a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me. But you know\n\"Y'know, this is a really impressive dream, if I do say so myself.\"\nBack at his house, I throw myself onto the bed where I woke up this\nmorning.\nI'll tell Tesshi and Saya about all this tomorrow: Listen to this dream 1\nhad! Isn't that amazin '? Aren't you awed by my fantastic imagination?! It s\nlike I actually went to Tokyo! I bet I'm gonna be a manga artist\u2014or no, wait,\nI'm not so great at art, but I bet writin' novels would be a cakewalk. I'll\nprobably make a ton of money! You wanna be my roommates in Tokyo?\nFantasizing about this and grinning to myself, I roll over onto my back, pick\nup Taki Tachibana's smartphone, and start skimming through it with my\nfingertip. Oh look, he keeps a diary\n[9/7 Ate at KFC with Tsukasa and Co.] [9/6\nMovie in Hibiya] [8/31 Architecture Tour\u2014\nBayside Edition] [8/25 Payday!]\nAs I scroll backward through the headers, I'm impressed in spite of myself.\n\"He's real thorough.\" Then I tap the photo app. Most of the pictures are\nlandscapes. After those, the majority are of him with Tsukasa and Takagi.\nEating ramen together, going to the park together... They sure are close. A beet\nbowl place, a soba shop at the station, a trendy hamburger joint. The road\nhome from school. Sunset through the gaps between the buildings. His friends'\nbacks. Jet contrails in the sky overhead.\n\"Lucky him, livin' in Tokyo...\"\nAs I murmur, a yawn slips out. Starting to get sleepy, I go to the next photo.\n\"Oh, it's Okudera-senpai.\"\nThe picture is of her back as she's cleaning the restaurant window, and it\nfeels like a candid shot. In the next, she's noticed and turned to face the\ncamera, beaming and flashing a peace sign.\n...Maybe he likes Okudera-senpai , I think out of nowhere. It's bound to be\nunrequited, though. She's in college. To her, high school guys are still just kids.\nI sit up on the bed and create an entry in his diary app. Then I start typing in\neverything I experienced today. About how I made a lot of mistakes but\nconnected with Okudera-senpai at the end. About how, on the way home from\nwork, we walked from the restaurant to the station together. I capture all of it in\nthe entry, wanting to report it\u2014or brag about it\u2014to Taki Tachibana. Once I'm\ndone, I yawn again. Then, out of nowhere...\nWho are you?\nFor some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.\nVaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room\nin Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there's something\noddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the\npalm of my hand, I write:\nMitsuha\nYaaaawwn...\nThat's the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,\nthrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored\nshower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to\nfinish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana's going to react when he sees the\nwriting on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.",

Either way, not\ngood. I swallow hard, and the three of them start in on me in menacing tones.\n\"Taki, you scumbag, whaddaya think you're doing, getting a jump on us?\"\n\"You'd better have an excuse, weasel.\" \"You two left together yesterday,\ndidn't you?\"\n\"Huh...

She greets us with a smile, strappy sandals\nclicking pleasantly.\n\"Hello, everyone.\"\n\"Hi!\"\nShe's sort of an idol at this place, and confronted with her stunning\npresence, the four of us reply in unison. For a moment, we almost forget about\nour problem. Then Okudera-senpai turns back and looks right at me.\n\"Let's make it another good day. Okay, Taki?\"\nI can almost hear a heart symbol punctuating that sentence, so sweetly\ndelivered, followed by a wink sent my way before she disappears through the\ndoor. I turn so red, it's like somebody dumped boiling water over my head.\nThis is way too much. I want to go polish all the glasses in the restaurant until\nthey shine, right this minute.\n\".Hey. Taki.\"\nThe guys' voices are so dark it's as though they're resounding from the\ndepths of the Earth, and I come back to myself with a jolt.\n\u2014Not good. As the senior staff cross-examines me, almost wailing, I\nwonder:\nWhat's going on here? Are they pranking me? Is everybody in on it? ...\nNah, couldn't be. What'd I do while I was out of it?\nWhat the heck is \"Mitsuha \"?\nThe birds are energetically twittering away again this morning.

      "text": "\"Graaaaan. Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?\"\nYotsuha whines.\nGran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.\n\"Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either.\"\nMayugorou?\n\".. .Who's that?\" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.\n\"Huh? Youdunno? He's famous.\"\nFamous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.\nThe three Miyamizu women\u2014me, the grandma, and Yotsuha\u2014have been\nhiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're\ntaking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.\nThese people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.\nThe sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.\nThe air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the\npleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in\nthis town now.\nCome to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.\nThe thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this\nmountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong\nwalker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've\nnever lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what\nkind of shape she's in.\n\"Hey, Grandma!\"\nI break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this\nlittle old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really\ngood lunches.\n\"Let me piggyback you. If you want...\"\n\"Oh, may I?\" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto\nmy back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at\nsomebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,\nwarm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs\nnothing.\n\"Grandma, you're way light\u2014 Whoa!\"\nThe moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.\nYotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, \"Come on, Sis!\" Come to think of it,\nMitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the\nworld this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.\n\"Mitsuha, Yotsuha.\"\nI hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.\n\"Are you familiar with musubiT '\n\" MusubiT '\nYotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to\nher stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole\nround lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from\nclimbing with her grandma on her back.\n\"In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of\nspirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's.\"\nGuardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old\nlady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and\nit's oddly persuasive.\n\"Did you know?\" she starts again. \"Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'\npeople is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the\nsame word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the\nbraided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself.\"\nI can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I\nthink.\n\"Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'\nundone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's\nmusubi .\"\nWithout really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up\nagainst rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a\nwhole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,\nbut I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I\nwake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,\nfalling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry\nmountain.\n\"Here, drink up.\"\nWe take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.\nIt's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,\nand I drain two cups in a row. \"C'mon! Me too!\" Yotsuha pesters. This may be\nthe best drink I've ever had.\n\"That's another musubi.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nAs I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.\nShe's sitting at the base of a tree.\n\"Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also\ncalled musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your\nsoul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition\nmeant to connect the god and humans to each other, a custom that the Miyamizu\nfamily has observed for centuries.\"",

Out of nowhere, I feel as if I've forgotten\nsomething.\nI narrow my eyes, searching the western sky, and find what I'm looking for\nright away. Above Venus, which is especially bright, I see the comet's shining\nblue tail. In the depths of my memory, something's trying to surface.\nThat's right. Once before, I...\nThat comet\u2014\n\".. .My, my. Mitsuha.\"\nBefore I know she's there, Grandma's peering up at me\u2014into me. My\nshadow is reflected at the bottom of her deep black eyes.\n\"You're dreamin', aren't you?\"\n!\nAll of a sudden...\nI wake up.\nI've flung the sheet away, and it falls off the bed without a sound. My\nheart's pounding hard enough to raise my ribs (at least I think it is), but I can't\nhear my heartbeat. That's weird\u2014 But just after the thought forms, little by\nlittle, I start hearing my blood pumping. The morning sparrows outside the\nwindow, car engines, the rumble of trains. As if I'm finally remembering\nwhere I am, my ears begin taking in Tokyo.\n\"...Tears?\"\nI touch my cheek and find droplets of water on my fingertips.\nWhy? I don't know. I wipe my eyes with my palm. Even as I do, the twilight\nlandscape from a moment ago and the old lady's words are disappearing, like\nwater soaking into sand.\nTweedle.\nBy my pillow, my phone chirps.\nI'm almost there. I'm looking forward to today, r;\nIt's a Line message from Okudera-senpai.\nAlmost here? What's she talking about? .. .And then I gasp.\n\"Wait, did Mitsuha\u2014? Not again!\" Panicked, I dive into my phone and read\nMitsuha's memo. \"Adate?!\"\nI bolt out of bed and get ready at top speed.\nDate with Okudera-senpai in Roppongi\ntomorrow! She'll be waiting in front of Yotsuya\nStation at 10:30. It's a date I want to go on, but\nif I'm unlucky and it ends up being you, be\ngrateful and enjoy it.\nFortunately, the place where we're meeting is nearby. I sprint flat out and\narrive with ten minutes to spare. As I catch my breath, I check my phone to\nmake sure. Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend\nmorning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.\nI wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter \"Mitsuha,\nyou idiot\" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.\n...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,\nthis is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,\nor an actress, or Miss Japan? Yeah, that's setting the bar fiendishly high.\nMitsuha, you moron. It's not too late yet, so I'm begging you, switch places\nwith me!\n\"Taaaki!\"\n\"Waugh!\"\nA voice startles me from behind, and I give a really lame yell. Hastily, I\nturn around.\n\"Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?\"\n\"No, I wasn't waiting! Uh, I mean, yes, I was! Or, no...\"\nWhat's with that question?! If I tell her I waited, I might make her feel bad,\nand if I tell her I wasn't waiting, I risk making her think I was late. Aaagh,\nwhat's the right answer?\n\"Urn, I, er...\"\nFlustered, I lookup. Okudera-senpai is standing right there, smiling at me.\nMy eyes go wide. She's in black mules, a white flared miniskirt, and a\nblack off-the-shoulder blouse. The monochrome outfit leaves her shoulders and\nlegs dazzlingly exposed, and several gold accessories have been placed\nstrategically, as if placing a careful seal on the charms of her skin. There's a\nlarge mocha-colored ribbon on her small white hat.\nShe looks incredibly sophisticated and incredibly pretty.\n\"...I just got here.\"\n\"Oh, good!\" she laughs, sounding chipper.\n\"Shall we?\"\nShe takes my arm... Ah, for a moment\u2014just a moment\u2014your breast\ntouched my arm. I have a sudden, immediate urge to polish every window in\nthis town.\n\"The conversation keeps dying...\"\nIn the bathroom, I'm hanging my head real, real low. I feel like smashing it\nagainst the mirror.\nThree hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever\nbeen in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope\nthat's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation\nunprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too\npretty.\nI mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.\nThen they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're\nthinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,\nanyway.\nWell, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I\nwant to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.\nConsequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can\ntell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely\nuncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.\nDammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!\nHoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.\n...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.\nAnd so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked\nlinks, just for you!\n\"Whoa, seriously?!\"\nLook at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them\nfor dear life.\nLink 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a\ncommunication disorder\nLink 2: Conversation skills for the person who's never, ever\nbeen the tiniest bit popular!\nLink 3: \\bu won't make 'em sick anymore! A feature on\ntexts they'll love\n.. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.\nWalking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.\nI'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled\nNostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-\nsenpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.\nFurano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is\ndivided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't\nknow the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can\nmake out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's\nsummer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem\noddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you\ngo. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. \"Shibuya\nand Ikebukuro,\" for example, or \"Akasaka and Kichijouji,\" or \"Meguro and\nTachikawa.\"\nEven so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.\nThis one is different from the others.\nWell, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place\u2014the contours\nof the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red\nshrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick\nout your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I\nnever actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations\nwhen I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful\nsense of deja vu about the place. This is\u2014\n\"Taki?\"\nWhen I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a\nsecond, I forgot she existed.\n\"You know, Taki,\" she says with an even smile, \"you seem like a different\nperson today.\"\nShe executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me\nbehind.\nI blew it.\nAll I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole\nthing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even\nconsider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.\nEven though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I\nshould've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've\nspent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.\nFrom the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi\nbuildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.\nMy eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.\nHer hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,\nshe might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat\ntighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I\ngrope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai?\"\nShe doesn't turn.\n\".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere\u2014\"\n\"Why don't we call it a day instead?\" she suggests with the tone of a patient\nteacher.\n\"Okay.\"\nOn the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-\nsenpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun\n\u2014I can't see it clearly.\n\"Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn't you?\"\n\"Huh?!\" She knew?! How?!\n\"And now there's someone else you like, isn't there?\"\n\"Huuuuuuuh?!\" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical\nrain forest. \"N-no, there isn't!\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Th-there isn't! There's absolutely nobody like that!\"\n\"I wonder...\"\nOkudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,\nthere's nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn't. Just for a moment, her long\nhair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost\nimmediately.\n\"Well, never mind.\"\nHer tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Thank you for today. I'll see you at work.\"\nOkudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me\nbehind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no\nwords come out, and while I'm doing that, Okudera-senpai's back descends\nfrom the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.\nI gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of\nsummer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,\nand after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on\na real bridge, over a river.

Are you kidding me?!\"\nI didn't ask her to come with me. How come I'm getting blamed? I look at\nTsukasa, willing him to say something. He does, swallowing a bite of miso\ncutlet.\n\"You are an abysmal tour planner.\"\n\"This isn't a tour!\"\nI lose it for a second. These two think they're on some kind of field trip. I\ncan read their expressions clearly. There's just no help for this child. Why are\nthey acting all superior, anyway?\n\"Well, never mind,\" Okudera-senpai says. Unexpectedly, she smiles,\nthrowing out her chest. \"Don't you worry, Taki. We'll help you look.\"\n\"Eeeee, it's so cuuuute! Taki, look at this, looook!\"\nAt the local station we finally reached after noon, Okudera-senpai gushes\nover the area's laid-back mascot. It's a full-body plush cow costume wearing a\nstation employee cap. The camera on Tsukasa's phone fires off click after click\nin the little terminal.\n\"You guys are in the way.\"\nAs I glare at the local map posted in the station, I'm even more convinced\nthat these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I'll just have to find her\nmyself.\nThe plan goes like this:\nSince I don't know exactly where Mitsuha's town is, we'll take the train to\na spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we'll\nhave to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew. We'll go around showing\nthe drawings to residents, asking if anyone recognizes them, slowly working\nour way north along the local line. There's a railroad crossing in one of the\nscenes I remember, so following the tracks should work.\nIt's a really vague approach, to the point where I can't really call it a\n\"plan\" at all, but I couldn't think of any other way. Besides, there can't be that\nmany towns built around lakes. I'm convinced I'll probably find some kind of\nhint by tonight, though I've got no grounds for thinking that.\nPsyching myself up, I take a confident first step, heading out to talk to the\ndriver of the lone taxi parked outside the station.\n\".. .This isn't gonna work...\"\nI'm slumped at a bus stop, my head drooping.\nAll the confidence I had when we started asking around has completely\ncaved.\nAfter that first taxi driver gave me a blunt \"N-nope, dunno,\" we tried police\nboxes, convenience stores, souvenir shops, guest houses, diners, and everyone\nfrom farmers to grade-school kids, oblivious to how we probably looked, but\nour results were solidly negative. The fact that there was only one local train\nevery two hours made it hard for us to get around, so we thought we'd try\nasking people on the bus. We boarded in high spirits but were the only\npassengers. I didn't even feel like asking the driver at that point, and the last\nstop was way out in the middle of nowhere, with no houses anywhere in sight.\nThe whole time, Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai cheerfully made the most of their\nday trip, playing word games, cards, phone games, variations on rock-paper-\nscissors, and eating snacks. Eventually, they ended up on either side of me on\nthe bus, leaning against my shoulders and dozing peacefully.\nNow, as the two of them guzzle cola in front of the bus stop, I sigh. They\nhear it and react together.\n\"Oh, come on, Taki! You're giving up already?!\"\n\"What about all our hard work?!\"\nI heave another sigh, so deep it almost brings my lungs up with it. Okudera-\nsenpai's wearing oddly gung-ho clothes meant for serious hiking. In contrast,\nTsukasa's in chinos like he's just strolling around the neighborhood. At this\npoint, both outfits really irritate me.\n\"You guys have been zero help.\nThey both look innocent, as if to say, Oh, really?\n\"I'll have a Takayama ramen.\"\n\"One Takayama ramen here.\"\n\"Uh, okay, then I'll have the same, too.\"\n\"You betcha. Three ramen!\" says the middle-aged lady cheerily.\nOn our fruitless way to the next (abnormally distant) station, we found a\nramen shop that was miraculously open and made a beeline inside. When the\nlady wearing a triangular kerchief told us, \"C'mon in,\" her smile seemed a\nbeacon, not unlike the appearance of a long-awaited search party when you're\nlost.\nThe ramen's good, too. Contrary to its name, it's perfectly ordinary ramen\n(I thought it might have Hi da beef on top, but it was regular braised pork), but\nas soon as I eat the noodles and veggies, I can feel my body recharging. After\ndraining the soup bowl dry and drinking two cups of water, I finally take a\nbreather.\n\"Do you think we'll be able to get back to Tokyo today?\" I ask Tsukasa.\n\"Hmm... I don't know. We may be cutting it close. Want me to check?\"\nTsukasa apparently didn't expect this but nevertheless pulls out his phone\nand starts looking up how to get home.\n\"Thanks,\" I tell him.\n\"Taki, you're sure that's all right?\" Okudera-senpai asks.\nShe's across the table from me and hasn't finished eating yet. I'm not\nimmediately sure how to answer, so I look out the window. The sun's just\nbarely caught on the edge of the mountains, shining peacefully over the fields\nalong the prefectural highway.\n\"I can't explain it, but it's starting to feel like I'm on the wrong track,\" I\nmutter, half to myself. It might be better to go back to Tokyo and rework my\nstrategy. It would be one thing if I had photos, but expecting to find the town\nwith sketches like these might have been asking too much. At least, that's how\nit starts to seem when I pick up my sketchbook and gaze at it. It's a completely\nordinary country town, with the sort of houses you see everywhere scattered\naround a round lake. Even though it felt so solid to me when I finished drawing\nit, it looks like an anonymous, mediocre landscape now.\n\"That's old Itomori, ain't it?\"\n\"Huh?\" I turn around and see the lady's apron. She's pouring water into my\nempty cup.\n\"Did you draw that, son? Say, can I have a look?\" She takes the sketchbook\nfrom me. \"This is a real good picture. Hon, c'mere a sec!\"\nThe woman shouts back toward the kitchen. The three of us watch her,\nmouths agape.\nThe ramen shop owner comes out of the kitchen and considers the sketch,\nsmiling a little. \"Oh, yeah. That was Itomori, for sure. Takes me back...\"\n\"My man's from Itomori, you see.\"\nItomori?\nSuddenly, I remember. I start up out of my chair.\n\"Itomori... Yeah, Itomori! Of course, why couldn't I remember that? It's\nItomori! It's near here, isn't it?!\"\nThe couple looks mystified, exchanging perplexed glances. The man opens\nhis mouth.\n\"Kid... You know about Itomori, don't you? That's where\u2014\"\nTsukasa interrupts loudly. \"Itomori?! Taki, don't tell me\u2014\"\n\"What, wait\u2014? You mean, the one where the comet...?!\"\nEven Okudera-senpai speaks up, eyes wide.\n\"Huh.?\"\nI don't understand what's going on and look around at the others. They're\nall watching me dubiously. The shadow of something that's been trying to\nsurface in my mind this whole time rustles stealthily, growing more and more\nominous.\nThe cry of a kite trails through the atmosphere, lonely enough to freeze the\nblood.\nA row of Do Not Enter barricades extends as far as the eye can see,\nthrowing long shadows over the cracked asphalt.\nA sign with vines tangled around it reads, In accordance with the\nDisaster Countermeasures Basic Act, this area is off-limits.

      "text": "Okudera-senpai walks up behind me, her voice trembling. Without waiting\nfor me to respond, Tsukasa answers, sounding desperately cheerful.\n\"It can't be! Like I've been saying, Taki's confused.\"\n\"...This is it.\"\nI tear my eyes away from the ruins below me, scanning my surroundings.\n\"It isn't just the town. I remember this schoolyard, the mountains around us,\nthe high school... I remember all of it perfectly!\"\nI have to shout the words to convince myself. Behind us is the school\nbuilding, black and sooty, with some of its windows broken. We're standing on\nthe grounds of Itomori High School, looking out across the lake.\n\"So you're saying this is the town you were looking for? The one where\nyour friend online lives?\" Tsukasa shouts, that parched smile still clinging to\nhis voice.\n\"That's not even possible! That disaster was three years ago. Hundreds of\npeople died! You remember it, right, Taki?!\"\nAt that, I finally turn toward Tsukasa.\n\"...Died?\"\nI meant to look at his face, but my gaze goes right through him, then through\nthe high school behind him, only to dissipate into the distance. I know I must be\nlooking at something, but there's nothing there.\n\"Three years ago...she died?\"\nAbruptly, I remember.\nThe comet I saw over Tokyo three years earlier. Countless shooting stars\nfalling through the western sky. I thought it was beautiful, like something out of\na dream. I got all excited about it.\nThat's when she died?\nDon't.\nI can't acknowledge that.\nI search for words. For proof.\n\"That can't be true... I mean, look, I've got the journal entries she wrote.\"\nI retrieve my phone out of my pocket. Spurred on by the inane fear that the\nbattery will die forever if I take too long, I flip through it in a panic and pull up\nMitsuha's journal entries. They're really there.\nI rub my eyes, hard. For a moment, the letters seemed to writhe.\n\"Wha...?\"\nFirst one letter, then another.\nThe words Mitsuha wrote begin dissolving into meaningless symbols.\nBefore long, the text flickers like a candle flame, and then it's gone. One by\none, her entries disappear entirely. It's as though an invisible man is holding\ndown delete. As I watch, all her sentences vanish.\n\"Why...?\" I ask very quietly.\nThe kite's cry echoes again, high and distant.\nThree years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet\nwith a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach\nto Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put\nHalley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4\nbillion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly\nseventy-five thousand miles of Earth\u2014closer than the moon. The tail of this\nshining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first\ntime in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it\nwelcomed Comet Tiamat.\nUntil the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's\nnucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in\ndiameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,\nplummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per\nsecond. Tragically, it struck Japan\u2014a residential area called Itomori.\nThe town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision\noccurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which\nmust have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.\nThe meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The\ndestruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge\nhole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,\nmagnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds\nlater, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater\npart of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the\ntown's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in\nhuman history.\nSince the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,\nultimately creating a gourd-shaped body of water, New Itomori Lake.\nDamage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the\nthousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In\nless than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.\nFourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori\nwas gone.\n\u2014These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.\nThree years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet\nTiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.\n.. .But that's weird.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nI lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.\nThat means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.\nThe comet and my swapping with Mitsuha had nothing to do with each\nother.\nIt'd be normal to think that. It's what I want to think.\nHowever, paging through books in this city library near Itomori, I'm\nhopelessly confused. For a while now, in the deepest corner of my mind,\nsomeone's been whispering, This is where you were.\nVanished Itomori\u2014Complete Records\nItomori\u2014The Village That Sank in a Night\nThe Tragedy of Comet Tiamat\nI flip through tome after tome with titles like these. The photos of bygone\ndays in Itomori unmistakably show places I've been. This is the grade school\nYotsuha goes to. Miyamizu Shrine is where their grandma is the chief priestess.\nThis pointlessly big parking lot, the two snack bars right next to each other, the\nconvenience store that looks like a barn, the little railroad crossing on the\nmountain road, and of course Itomori High School... At this point, I recognize\nall of them clearly. Seeing those ruined streets with my own eyes has\nsharpened my memories.\nIt's hard to breathe. My heart is struggling, beating irregularly, and refuses\nto calm down.\nIt feels as though the vivid photos are silently absorbing the air and any\nsense of reality.\nItomori High\u2014Final Sports Festival\nThe photo above the caption shows high schoolers in the middle of a three-\nlegged race. The pair on the end seems familiar. One has straight-cut bangs and\nbraids. The other girl's hair is bound up with an orange cord.\nThe air gets even thinner.\nI feel as though hot blood is oozing down the back of my neck, but when I\nwipe it away with my hand, it's transparent sweat.\nTaki.\"\nI look up. Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai are standing there. They hand me a\nsingle book. Foil letters in a weighty font are stamped on its thick cover:\nItomori Comet Disaster List and Catalog of Victims\nI turn the pages. The victims' names and addresses are given by district. I\nrun my finger down them. I keep turning pages. Finally, my finger stops on\nnames I recognize.\nTeshigawara, Katsuhiko (17)\nNatori, Sayaka (17)\n\"Teshigawara and Saya...\"\nAs I murmur, I hear Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai suck in their breath.\nThen I find the names that prove it all.\nMiyamizu, Hitoha (82)\nMiyamizu, Mitsuha (17)\nMiyamizu, \\btsuha (9)\nThe other two peer over my shoulder at the list.\n\"That's her.? It has to be some kind of mistake! I mean, she's\u2014\"\nOkudera-senpai sounds as if she might burst into tears. \"She's been dead for\nthree years.\"",

      "text": "He's gruff and doesn't say much, but he's a really nice guy , I think, studying\nthe sinewy hands on the steering wheel beside me.\nIt's the man from the ramen shop. He's the one who took us to Itomori High\nSchool yesterday, and to the city library. I called him really early this morning,\nand he still did me a favor and brought the car over. If this hadn't worked, I\nwas planning to hitchhike, but I can't imagine any cars would've given me a\nride to a ruined, abandoned town. I'm seriously lucky I met this guy in Hida.\nFrom the passenger-side window, I have a view down to the edge of New\nItomori Lake. Half-demolished houses and broken asphalt languish in the\nwater. Even a good ways offshore, I can see telephone poles and iron beams\njutting out of the lake. It should be a very disconcerting sight, but I must have\ngotten used to seeing it on TV and in photos, because I start feeling as if the\nplace has always been like this. For that reason, I don't really know how to\nprocess what I'm seeing. Should I get mad, grieve, get scared, or lament my\nown helplessness? The reality of losing an entire town is probably too much\nfor ordinary people to get their heads around. I give up searching for meaning\nin the scene and turn my eyes to the sky. Gray clouds hang over our heads, as if\nthe gods have set an enormous lid there.\nWe travel north along the lake, and when the car can't go any higher, the\nman sets the parking brake.\n\"Looks like rain,\" he mutters, glancing up through the windshield. \"This\nmountain ain't real steep, but don't push your luck. If anythin' happens, you call\nus.\"\n\"Yessir.\"\n\"Also, here\u2014\" He holds out a big lunch box to me. \"Eat this up top.\"\nAutomatically, I accept it with both hands. It's heavy.\n\"Th-thank you very much...\"\n.. .For everything. Seriously. Why would you do so much for me? Oh yeah,\nand the ramen was super good. I can't make any of the words come out the way\nI want them to\u2014all I manage is a tiny \"Thanks. Really.\" The guy smiles\nslightly, takes out a cigarette, and lights up.\n\"I dunno what's goin' on with you,\" he says, exhaling smoke. \"But that\npicture ofltomori you made. That was good.\"\nThere's a lump in my throat. Distant thunder rumbles softly.\nI'm walking up a path to the shrine that's as vague as a deer track.\nSometimes I stop to check the destination I've marked on the map against\nthe GPS on my phone. It's all right\u2014I'm getting closer. The surrounding\nscenery looks sort of familiar, but I've climbed this mountain only once, in a\ndream. I'm not very sure about it. That means, for now, all I can do is follow\nthe map.\nAfter I got out of the car, I bowed low and stayed that way until my ride\nwas completely out of sight. As I did, I thought about Tsukasa and Okudera-\nsenpai, too. In the end, this guy and those two came all the way out here\nbecause they were worried about me. I must've looked really pathetic. I bet\nthey thought I was about to cry the whole time. I was probably so aggressively\ndistracted that, even if they wanted to ditch me, they couldn't.\nI can't keep acting like that forever. I can't keep taking advantage of the\nhelp people offer me, I think firmly, gazing at New Itomori Lake through the\ngaps in the trees.\nSuddenly, a big raindrop hits my face. The leaves around me start to rustle\nand shake. I pull up my hood and break into a run.\nThe rain keeps falling, pouring down with enough force to carve the dirt\naway.\nThe temperature's falling rapidly, absorbed by the rain. I can feel it on my\nskin.\nI eat my lunch in a little cave while waiting for the weather to let up. There\nare three big rice balls the size of my fist and lots of side dishes. The thick-\nsliced braised pork and bean sprouts stir-fried in sesame oil make it look like\nsuch a stereotypical ramen-shop lunch that it's funny. My body shakes with\ncold, but as I eat, I gradually warm up again. Chewing the grains of rice and\nswallowing, I can sense exactly where my throat and stomach are.\nThis is musubi, I think.\n\"Putting anything in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also\ncalled musubi. What you put in your body binds to your soul, you see. \"\nThat day, I decided I'd remember those words even after I woke up. I say it\naloud:\n\"...They twist and tangle, sometimes come undone, and reunite. That's\nmusubi. That's time.\"\nI look at the cord on my wrist.\nIt hasn't worn through yet. The connection is still there.\nBefore I know it, the trees have vanished, and I'm in a mossy, rocky area.",

I've finally reached the peak.\n\"...It's there!\"\nSure enough, beyond me, there's the crater-shaped basin and the giant\nsacred tree.\n\"It's really there! It wasn't a dream!\"\nThe rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears. I\nscrub roughly at my face with my sleeve, then start down the slope into the\ncaldera.\nIn front of me, what was a little stream in my memories is now a decent-\nsize pond. Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that\ndream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several\ndozen yards away on the other side.\nThis is the edge of the next world.\nI remember somebody saying that to me once.\nDoes that make this the Sanzu River?\nI step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot\ninto a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The\nheavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing\nsound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with\nmuddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm\nnot welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,\ninto the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get\nacross somehow.\nThe massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.\nI don't know whether the \"body of the god\" is the tree, the rock, or whether\nthe shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's\na little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go\ndown it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.\nThe silence here is even deeper than it was outside.\nI unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to\nmake sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single\nmovement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems\ncompletely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.\nThis place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.\nThe tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,\ntwo four-inch urns sit side by side.\n\"It's the sake we carried up here.\"\nGently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold\nanymore.\n\"This is her little sister's...\"\nMy hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick\nit up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put\ndown roots.\n\"And this is the one I brought.\"\nI sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on\nit. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It\nmust have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this\ntime into words.\n. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?\"\nI untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.\n\"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died\nthree years ago when the meteorite fell?\"\nI pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the\nlid.\n\"Half of her...\"\nI bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles\nfloating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.\n\" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then\nreuniting...\"\nI raise the lidful of sake to my lips.\n\"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time...\"\nTake me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound\nis so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it\nhits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.\nBut nothing happens.\nFor a little while, I sit very still.\nI'm not used to alcohol, and I feel a little warm. My head feels slightly\nvague and dizzy... But that's all.\nIt's no good. It didn't work.\nI put one knee up, then stand. Abruptly, my feet tangle. My vision spins. I'm\nfalling , I think.\n...That's weird.\nI've fallen over backward, but no matter how much time passes, my back\ndoesn't hit the ground. My field of view rotates, slowly, up to the roof of the\ncave. My phone is still in my left hand. The light illuminates the ceiling.\n\"The comet...!\"\nInvoluntarily, I say it out loud.\nThere's a drawing of an enormous comet up there.\nIt's a very old picture, carved into the rock: a giant traveling star, trailing\nits long tail across the heavens. The red and blue pigments catch the light and\nshimmer. Gradually, the picture begins rising away from the ceiling of the\ncave.\nI stare.\nThe image, the illustrated comet, is falling toward me.\nSlowly, it bears down until it's nearly on top of me. It blazes with the heat\nof its friction against the atmosphere, and the lump of rock fuses into glass,\nshining like a jewel. Even those details are clear to me.\nI fall back, and my head hits the rock at the exact moment the comet strikes",

As if to shove down the anxiety suddenly\namassing inside me, I force a smile and speak cheerfully. \"Hey, Mitsuha. So\nwe don't forget each other after we wake up...\" I take a felt-tip pen from my\npocket. I catch Mitsuha's right hand, then write on her palm \"Let's write down\nour names. Here.\"\nI give the pen to Mitsuha.\nShe breaks into a smile. It's like watching a flower bloom. She takes my\nright hand and sets the tip of the pen against it.\nTunk.\nThere's a tiny, hard noise by my feet. I look down, and there's the pen on\nthe ground.\n\"Huh?\" I raise my head.\nThere's nobody in front of me.\n\"What...?\"\nI turn this way and that.\n\"Mitsuha? Hey, Mitsuha?\"\nI call louder. No response. Unnerved, I pace the area. The shadows are\nsinking into blue-black darkness. Below me are leaden, featureless clouds, and\nin the gloom below them, I can just make out gourd-shaped Itomori Lake.\nMitsuha's gone.\nNight is here.\nI'm back in my own body, three years in the fixture.\nI look at my right hand. There's no braided cord on my wrist now. On my\npalm, there's just one thin, short, half-drawn line. I touch it gently.\n\".. .1 was going to tell you..I mutter quietly to the line. \"No matter where\nin the world you are, I'll find you again. I swear.\"\nUp in the sky, the comet's nowhere to be seen, and a few stars are beginning\nto twinkle.\n\"Your name is Mitsuha.\"\nI close my eyes, making sure of my memories, turning them into something I\ncan count on.\n\"It's okay. I remember!\"\nConfidence deepening, I open my eyes again. There's a white half-moon in\nthe distant horizon.\n\"Mitsuha, Mitsuha... Mitsuha, Misua, Misua. Your name is Misua!\"\nI'm yelling her name at the half-moon.\n\"Your name is...!\"\nAbruptly, the outline of the word I meant to utter blurs.\nI quickly snatch up the pen and write the first letter of her name on my\npalm... Or I try to.\n66\nAfter a single line, my hand stops. The tip of the pen starts to tremble. I\nwant to make it stop shaking and grip it tight. I try stabbing it in like a needle,\nto carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an\ninch. My lips move.\n\"...Who are you?\"\nThe pen falls from my hand.\nThey're vanishing. Your name. Your memories.\n\"Why did I come here?\"\nI want to tether them to me somehow, to scrape the fragments of memory\ntogether, so I say them aloud.\n\"Her... I came to see her! I came to save her! I wanted her to live!\"\nIt's disappearing. Something so precious to me is disappearing.\n\"Who are you? Who are you, who are you, who are you...?\"\nSlipping away. Even the emotions I know I felt are leaving me.\n\"Somebody important, somebody I can't forget, somebody I didn't want to\nforget!\"\nEverything's vanishing, sorrow and love alike. I don't even know why I'm\ncrying now. My emotions are disintegrating, crumbling like a sand castle.\n\"Who are you, who are you, who...?\"\nAfter the sand has completely eroded, just one thing remains. I know it's\nloneliness. In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all\nthat stays with me. I'll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone's forced\nme to take.\nFine, I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is\nloneliness, I'll still live with everything I've got. Even if this emotion is all I\nhave, I'll keep struggling. Even if we're separated, even if we never meet\nagain, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting\nresolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll\nforget even the fact that I've forgotten something.\nAnd so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky\none last time:\n\"What's your name?\"\nThe cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains. Asking its\nquestion of the void over and over, it diminishes, bit by bit.\nFinally, silence descends.",

Well, it's not going so great.\"\n\"Hmm...\" Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She\ninspects me from head to toe with a frown.

We set off,\ngoing against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut\nacross Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that\nthe trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass\nhave on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,\ntoo.\n\"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue.\"\nFeeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to\nOkudera-senpai beside me.\n\"What?\" Her glossy lips pout. \"I can't get in touch with you without a\nreason?\"\n\"No, no, no!\" I wave my hands hastily.\n\"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time.\"\n\"Y-yes. I am.\"\nShe smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. \"I was in the area\nfor work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki.\" She was hired by a major\nclothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. \"Life in the suburbs\nis fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind,\" she tells me, gazing at\nher surroundings like she's a little awestruck. \"Look,\" she says suddenly, and I\nraise my head.\nWe're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant\noutdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage\nof gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster\u2014Eight\nYears Later in big letters.\n\"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?\" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,\nas though she's searching distant memories. \"You were still in high school,\nTaki, so it must've been...\"\n\"Five years ago, maybe?\" I finish the sentence for her.\n\"That long...\" She exhales a little, as if surprised. \"I'm forgetting all sorts\nof things.\"\nShe's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk\nup Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I\ntry remembering that day.\nIt was the summer of my second year in high school\u2014 No, it was just about\nthis time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short\ntrip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way\nto Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.\nRight, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the\nside of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur\nand grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a\nvague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed\na mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to\nTokyo by myself the next day.\nThat's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that\ncomet.\nIn the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human\nhistory, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,\nalmost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the\ncomet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and\nmost of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.\nIt was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all\nsorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical\nphenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the\nmedia's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around\nwildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit\nwith Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or\nquestioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an\nevacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been\nforetold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so\nisolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the\npower across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite\nstrike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the\nprograms to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as\nwith most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of\nItomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.\nStill... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of\nItomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had\nmaterialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had\nvisited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.\nWhat in the world had it been?\nWell, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink\ninto the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I\nwrite the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job\nnext year, not ancient history I don't really remember.\n\"The wind's come up,\" Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair\nrises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,\nreaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a\nmelancholy inside me.\n\"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough,\" Okudera-senpai\nsays when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.",

      "text": "\"You'll find happiness someday, too,\" she'd assured me earlier over an\nespresso, after informing me she was getting married. I couldn't manage a good\nresponse\u2014I just mumbled something congratulatory.\nI'm not particularly unhappy , I think, watching Okudera-senpai's\nsilhouette descend the pedestrian-bridge stairs. That said, I don't really\nunderstand what happiness is yet, either.\nI abruptly inspect my palm. All that's there is an absence.\nJust a little longer..., I think one more time.\nBefore I know it, the season's changed again.\nAn unusually typhoon-filled autumn passed, moving straight into a winter of\nnothing but cold rain. Tonight, too, the rain is whispering down unabated, like\nthe memory of a pleasant chat on some bygone day Christmas lights twinkle\nbeyond windows beaded thickly with water droplets.\nI take a sip from my paper cup of coffee, as if swallowing my scattered\nthoughts, then look down at my notebook again. Even now, in December, it's\npacked with job-hunting appointments.\nVisits with former upperclassmen to discuss their work, information\nsessions, entry deadlines, paper schedules, interview dates. The range is\nchaotic, covering everything from major general contractors to design offices\nto old-town factories, and as I check the notebook against the schedule on my\nphone, even I'm a bit disgusted by it. I start organizing the main points from\ntomorrow onward, writing them into my notebook.\n\"Y'know, I'd like to go to at least one more bridal fair.\"\nMixed with the sound of the rain, the conversations of strangers sound a bit\nlike secrets. The couple behind me has been discussing their wedding for a\nwhile now, and it makes me think of Okudera-senpai. Their voices and bearing\nare completely different, though. There's a bit of an easygoing regional accent\nto their speech, and their conversation seems completely relaxed, as if they're\nchildhood friends. I'm not really listening, but my ears pick up what they're\nsaying.\n\"Again?\" The guy sounds annoyed, but even then, there's no mistaking the\naffection in his tone. \"We've been to a ton of fairs already. They were all\npretty much the same stuff.\"\n\"Well, I was thinkin' a Shinto ceremony might be nice, too.\"\n\"You said your dream was to have it in a chapel.\"\n\"This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I can't make up my mind that easily.\"\n\"But you said you did make up your mind,\" the guy quietly complains, and I\nchuckle.\nThe girl ignores him. \"Hmm.she murmurs, thinking. \"Never mind that.\nTesshi, you gotta shave off those whiskers before the ceremony.\"\nI was about to drink my coffee, but my hand stops dead.\nMy pulse is speeding up, though I don't understand why.\n\"I'll lose a few pounds for you, 'kay?\"\n\"But you're eatin' cake!\"\n\"I'll start for real tomorrow!\"\nSlowly, I look behind me.\nThe two of them have already gotten up from their chairs and are pulling on\ntheir coats. The tall, skinny guy is wearing a stocking cap over his buzzed\nhead. I just catch a glimpse of his profile. The girl is petite, and her bobbed\nhair makes her seem young, almost like a student. The pair turns away and\nleaves the cafe. For some reason, I can't take my eyes off their backs.\n\"Thank you for your visit.\" The cafe employee's voice reaches my ears\nindistinctly, mingled with the rain.\nBy the time I leave the cafe, the rain has turned to snow.\nMaybe it's because of all the moisture up in the atmosphere, but the town is\noddly warm in the falling snow. I feel strangely uneasy, as if I've wandered\ninto the wrong season. It seems to me as if each and every person I pass is\nhiding some important secret, and in spite of myself, I keep turning back to\nlook at them.\nI go straight to the ward library, which is almost ready to close for the\nevening. The sparseness of the handful of readers in the vast, vaulted space\nmakes the air inside feel even chillier than outside. I take a seat and open the\nbook I've retrieved from the stacks. The title is Vanished Itomori\u2014Complete\nRecords. It's a collection of photographs.\nAs if removing an ancient seal, I slowly page through the book.\nGingko trees and an elementary school. The shrine's steep stairs, with their\nview over the lake. A shrine gate with peeling paint. A tiny railroad crossing,\nlike toy building blocks abruptly set down in the fields. A pointlessly\nexpansive parking lot, two snack bars right next to each other, a drab concrete\nhigh school. A prefectural road with old, cracked asphalt. A guardrail that\ntraces a winding hill road. Vinyl greenhouses, reflecting the sky.\nThey're the sort of ordinary sights you see all over Japan, so I recognize all\nof them. I can visualize the temperature of the stone walls and the chill of the\nwind, just as if I'd lived there.\nWhy is this so... ? I wonder as I turn the pages.\nWhy do the unremarkable sights of a town that no longer exists make my\nheart hurt this much?\n+ + +",

He's looking straight at me, and his eyes are\nwide with surprise, like mine. Then I realize what the wish I've carried for so\nlong really is.\nShe's there, just a few feet away. I don't even know her name, but I know\nit's her. Our trains are pulling away from each other. Then another train passes\nbetween us, and I lose sight of her.\nBut I finally know what I'm wishing for.\nI wanted to stay with her, just a little longer.\nI want to be with him, just a little more.\nThe train stops, and I dash through the streets. I'm looking for her. I'm already\npositive she's looking for me, too.\nWe've met before. Or, no, that could be my imagination. It might be just an\nassumption, something like a dream. It might be a delusion, like past lives.\nEven so, I\u2014we\u2014wanted to stay together a little longer. We want to be\ntogether, just a little more.\nAs I run along the sloping road, I wonder, Why am I running? Why am 1\nsearching? I probably know the answer. I don't remember it, but everything in\nmy body knows. I turn at a narrow alley, and the road drops off. Stairs. I walk\nover to them, look down.. .and there he is.\nFighting back the urge to run, I climb the stairs slowly. A wind that smells\nlike flowers lifts my suit jacket and fills it out into a bell. She's standing at the\ntop of the stairs, but I can't look at her directly. I only watch her out of the\ncorner of my eye. She's descending the stairs. The click of her shoes drifts\nsoftly into the spring air. My heart is leaping in my rib cage.\nAs we approach each other, we keep our eyes downcast. He doesn't say\nanything. I can't say anything, either. Then, still without speaking, we pass each\nother. In that moment, I feel a tense, squeezing pain all over, as though\nsomething inside me has taken hold of my heart. This is wrong, I think fiercely.\nWe can't possibly be strangers. It goes against something as basic as the\nmechanics of the universe, or the laws of life. And so...\nAnd so I turn around. She turns, too, with the exact same speed. She's\nstanding on the stairs, the streets of Tokyo behind her, her eyes wide and round.\nI realize her long hair is tied back with a cord the color of the evening sun. My\nwhole body trembles slightly.\nI finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into\ntears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.\nEven as I cry, I smile, too. The spring air carries with it all sorts of\napprehension and anticipation, and I draw a deep breath.\nThen we open our mouths at the same time.\nLike children who've agreed to go on the count of three, we say together:",
