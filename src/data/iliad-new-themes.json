The priest being refused, and insolently\ndismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who\ninflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and\nencourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the\nrefusal of Chryse\u00efs. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,\nenters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;\nhowever, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on\nBrise\u00efs in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his\nforces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she\nsupplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her\nson, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit,\nincenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are\nreconciled by the address of Vulcan.\nThe time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine\nduring the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes,\nand twelve for Jupiter's stay with the \u00c6thiopians, at whose return\nThetis prefers her petition.

match'd with thine,\nAs thy own actions if compared to mine.\nThine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,\nThough mine the sweat and danger of the day.\nSome trivial present to my ships I bear:\nOr barren praises pay the wounds of war.\nBut know, proud monarch, I'm thy slave no more;\nMy fleet shall waft me to Thessalia's shore:\nLeft by Achilles on the Trojan plain,\nWhat spoils, what conquests, shall Atrides gain?\"\nTo this the king: \"Fly, mighty warrior! fly;\nThy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.\nThere want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,\nAnd Jove himself shall guard a monarch's right.\nOf all the kings (the god's distinguish'd care)\nTo power superior none such hatred bear:\nStrife and debate thy restless soul employ,\nAnd wars and horrors are thy savage joy,\nIf thou hast strength, 'twas Heaven that strength bestow'd;\nFor know, vain man! thy valour is from God.\nHaste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away;\nRule thy own realms with arbitrary sway;\nI heed thee not, but prize at equal rate\nThy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.\nGo, threat thy earth-born Myrmidons:\u2014but here[56]\n'Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.\nKnow, if the god the beauteous dame demand,\nMy bark shall waft her to her native land;\nBut then prepare, imperious prince! prepare,\nFierce as thou art, to yield thy captive fair:\nEven in thy tent I'll seize the blooming prize,\nThy loved Brise\u00efs with the radiant eyes.\nHence shalt thou prove my might, and curse the hour\nThou stood'st a rival of imperial power;\nAnd hence, to all our hosts it shall be known,\nThat kings are subject to the gods alone.\"\nAchilles heard, with grief and rage oppress'd,",

'tis given thee to destroy\nThe lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.\nFor now no more the gods with fate contend,\nAt Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.\nDestruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,\nAnd nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.\nThis hear observant, and the gods obey!'\nThe vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.\nNow, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,\nUnite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.\nBut first, with caution, try what yet they dare,\nWorn with nine years of unsuccessful war.\nTo move the troops to measure back the main,\nBe mine; and yours the province to detain.\"\nHe spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,\n(Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd,)\n\"Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,\nNor doubt the vision of the powers divine;\nSent by great Jove to him who rules the host,\nForbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!\nThen let us haste, obey the god's alarms,\nAnd join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms.\"\nThus spoke the sage: the kings without delay\nDissolve the council, and their chief obey:\nThe sceptred rulers lead; the following host,\nPour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.\nAs from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees\nClustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,\nRolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,\nWith deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;\nDusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,\nAnd o'er the vale descends the living cloud.[81]\nSo, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train\nSpreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:\nAlong the region runs a deafening sound;\nBeneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.\nFame flies before the messenger of Jove,\nAnd shining soars, and claps her wings above.\nNine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud[82]\nThe monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.\nSoon as the throngs in order ranged appear,\nAnd fainter murmurs died upon the ear,\nThe king of kings his awful figure raised:\nHigh in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;\nThe golden sceptre, of celestial flame,\nBy Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.\nTo Pelops he the immortal gift resign'd;\nThe immortal gift great Pelops left behind,\nIn Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,\nTo rich Thyestes next the prize descends;\nAnd now the mark of Agamemnon's reign,\nSubjects all Argos, and controls the main.[83]\nOn this bright sceptre now the king reclined,\nAnd artful thus pronounced the speech design'd:\n\"Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader's care,\nHeroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!\nOf partial Jove with justice I complain,\nAnd heavenly oracles believed in vain\nA safe return was promised to our toils,\nRenown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.\nNow shameful flight alone can save the host,\nOur blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.\nSo Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!\nAt whose command whole empires rise or fall:\nHe shakes the feeble props of human trust,\nAnd towns and armies humbles to the dust.\nWhat shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,\nOh, lasting shame in every future age!\nOnce great in arms, the common scorn we grow,\nRepulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.\nSo small their number, that if wars were ceased,\nAnd Greece triumphant held a general feast,\nAll rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine\nMust want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.[84]\nBut other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,\nAnd Troy prevails by armies not her own.\nNow nine long years of mighty Jove are run,\nSince first the labours of this war begun:\nOur cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,\nAnd scarce insure the wretched power to fly.\nHaste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!\nOur weeping wives, our tender children call:\nLove, duty, safety, summon us away,\n'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey.\nOur shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,\nSafe and inglorious, to our native shore.\nFly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,\nAnd dream no more of heaven-defended Troy.\"\nHis deep design unknown, the hosts approve\nAtrides' speech. The mighty numbers move.\nSo roll the billows to the Icarian shore,\nFrom east and south when winds begin to roar,\nBurst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep\nThe whitening surface of the ruffled deep.\nAnd as on corn when western gusts descend,[85]\nBefore the blast the lofty harvests bend:\nThus o'er the field the moving host appears,\nWith nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.\nThe gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet\nBeat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;\nWith long-resounding cries they urge the train\nTo fit the ships, and launch into the main.",

O dire disgrace!\nAnd leave unpunish'd this perfidious race?\nShall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,\nIn peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?\nAnd bravest chiefs, in Helen's quarrel slain,\nLie unrevenged on yon detested plain?\nNo: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,\nOnce more refulgent shine in brazen arms.\nHaste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,\nNor let one sail be hoisted on the main.\"\nPallas obeys, and from Olympus' height\nSwift to the ships precipitates her flight.\nUlysses, first in public cares, she found,\nFor prudent counsel like the gods renown'd:\nOppress'd with generous grief the hero stood,\nNor drew his sable vessels to the flood.\n\"And is it thus, divine Laertes' son,\nThus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),\nThus to their country bear their own disgrace,\nAnd fame eternal leave to Priam's race?\nShall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,\nStill unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!\nHaste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,\nRecall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.\nYour own resistless eloquence employ,\nAnd to the immortals trust the fall of Troy.\"\nThe voice divine confess'd the warlike maid,\nUlysses heard, nor uninspired obey'd:\nThen meeting first Atrides, from his hand\nReceived the imperial sceptre of command.\nThus graced, attention and respect to gain,\nHe runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;\nEach prince of name, or chief in arms approved,\nHe fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.\n\"Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless'd,\nBy brave examples should confirm the rest.\nThe monarch's will not yet reveal'd appears;\nHe tries our courage, but resents our fears.\nThe unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;\nNot thus the king in secret council spoke.\nJove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,\nBeware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings.\"\nBut if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,\nHim with reproof he check'd or tamed with blows.\n\"Be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield;\nUnknown alike in council and in field!\nYe gods, what dastards would our host command!\nSwept to the war, the lumber of a land.\nBe silent, wretch, and think not here allow'd\nThat worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.\nTo one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;\nHis are the laws, and him let all obey.\"[86]\nWith words like these the troops Ulysses ruled,\nThe loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool'd.\nBack to the assembly roll the thronging train,\nDesert the ships, and pour upon the plain.\nMurmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,\nAnd heaves huge surges to the trembling shores;\nThe groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,\nThe rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.\nAt length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,\nAnd a still silence lulls the camp to peace.\nThersites only clamour'd in the throng,\nLoquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue:\nAwed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,\nIn scandal busy, in reproaches bold:\nWith witty malice studious to defame,\nScorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:\u2014\nBut chief he gloried with licentious style\nTo lash the great, and monarchs to revile.\nHis figure such as might his soul proclaim;\nOne eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:\nHis mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,\nThin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head.\nSpleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd,\nAnd much he hated all, but most the best:\nUlysses or Achilles still his theme;\nBut royal scandal his delight supreme,\nLong had he lived the scorn of every Greek,\nVex'd when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.\nSharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,\nThus with injurious taunts attack'd the throne.\n\"Amidst the glories of so bright a reign,\nWhat moves the great Atrides to complain?\n'Tis thine whate'er the warrior's breast inflames,\nThe golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.\nWith all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,\nThy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow.\nThus at full ease in heaps of riches roll'd,\nWhat grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold?\nSay, shall we march with our unconquer'd powers\n(The Greeks and I) to Ilion's hostile towers,\nAnd bring the race of royal bastards here,\nFor Troy to ransom at a price too dear?\nBut safer plunder thy own host supplies;\nSay, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader's prize?\nOr, if thy heart to generous love be led,\nSome captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?\nWhate'er our master craves submit we must,\nPlagued with his pride, or punish'd for his lust.\nOh women of Achaia; men no more!\nHence let us fly, and let him waste his store\nIn loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.\nWe may be wanted on some busy day,\nWhen Hector comes: so great Achilles may:\nFrom him he forced the prize we jointly gave,\nFrom him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:\nAnd durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,\nThis mighty tyrant were no tyrant long.\"\nFierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,[87]\nIn generous vengeance of the king of kings.\nWith indignation sparkling in his eyes,\nHe views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:\n\"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,\nWith wrangling talents form'd for foul debate:\nCurb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,\nAnd singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.\nHave we not known thee, slave! of all our host,\nThe man who acts the least, upbraids the most?\nThink not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring,\nNor let those lips profane the name of king.\nFor our return we trust the heavenly powers;\nBe that their care; to fight like men be ours.\nBut grant the host with wealth the general load,\nExcept detraction, what hast thou bestow'd?\nSuppose some hero should his spoils resign,\nArt thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?\nGods! let me perish on this hateful shore,\nAnd let these eyes behold my son no more;\nIf, on thy next offence, this hand forbear\nTo strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,\nExpel the council where our princes meet,\nAnd send thee scourged and howling through the fleet.\"\nHe said, and cowering as the dastard bends,\nThe weighty sceptre on his back descends.[88]\nOn the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:\nThe tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;\nTrembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,\nFrom his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;\nWhile to his neighbour each express'd his thought:\n\"Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!\nWhat fruits his conduct and his courage yield!\nGreat in the council, glorious in the field.\nGenerous he rises in the crown's defence,\nTo curb the factious tongue of insolence,\nSuch just examples on offenders shown,\nSedition silence, and assert the throne.\"\n'Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,\nWho, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:\nThe blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,\n(In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.\nThe expecting crowds in still attention hung,\nTo hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.\nThen deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,\nHis silence thus the prudent hero broke:\n\"Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race\nWith shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.\nNot such at Argos was their generous vow:\nOnce all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:\nNe'er to return, was then the common cry,\nTill Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.\nBehold them weeping for their native shore;\nWhat could their wives or helpless children more?\nWhat heart but melts to leave the tender train,\nAnd, one short month, endure the wintry main?\nFew leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,\nWhen the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:\nThen well may this long stay provoke their tears,\nThe tedious length of nine revolving years.\nNot for their grief the Grecian host I blame;\nBut vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!\nExpect the time to Troy's destruction given.\nAnd try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.\nWhat pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,[89]\nAnd all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.\nBeside a fountain's sacred brink we raised\nOur verdant altars, and the victims blazed:\n'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,\nThe altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground\nA mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;\nFrom Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.\nStraight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,\nAnd curl'd around in many a winding fold;\nThe topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;\nEight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;\nHerself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,\nStretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;\nWhile hovering near, with miserable moan,\nThe drooping mother wail'd her children gone.\nThe mother last, as round the nest she flew,\nSeized by the beating wing, the monster slew;\nNor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands\nA lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.\nSuch was the will of Jove; and hence we dare\nTrust in his omen, and support the war.\nFor while around we gazed with wondering eyes,\nAnd trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,\nFull of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,[90]\n'Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.\nThis wondrous signal Jove himself displays,\nOf long, long labours, but eternal praise.\nAs many birds as by the snake were slain,\nSo many years the toils of Greece remain;\nBut wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'\nThus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.\nObey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,\nNor let your flight avert the Trojan fate.\"\nHe said: the shores with loud applauses sound,\nThe hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.\nThen Nestor thus\u2014\"These vain debates forbear,\nYe talk like children, not like heroes dare.\nWhere now are all your high resolves at last?\nYour leagues concluded, your engagements past?\nVow'd with libations and with victims then,\nNow vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!\nWhile useless words consume the unactive hours,\nNo wonder Troy so long resists our powers.\nRise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;\nWe march to war, if thou direct the way.\nBut leave the few that dare resist thy laws,\nThe mean deserters of the Grecian cause,\nTo grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,\nAnd view with envy our successful wars.\nOn that great day, when first the martial train,\nBig with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,\nJove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,\nAnd thunder rolling shook the firmament.\nEncouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,\nTill every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,\nTill Helen's woes at full revenged appear,\nAnd Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.\nBefore that day, if any Greek invite\nHis country's troops to base, inglorious flight,\nStand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,\nAnd die the dastard first, who dreads to die.\nBut now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:[91]\nNor what they offer, thou thyself despise.\nAmong those counsels, let not mine be vain;\nIn tribes and nations to divide thy train:\nHis separate troops let every leader call,\nEach strengthen each, and all encourage all.\nWhat chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,\nOr bravely fights, or ill obeys command,\nWhen thus distinct they war, shall soon be known\nAnd what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;\nIf fate resists, or if our arms are slow,\nIf gods above prevent, or men below.\"\nTo him the king: \"How much thy years excel\nIn arts of counsel, and in speaking well!\nO would the gods, in love to Greece, decree\nBut ten such sages as they grant in thee;\nSuch wisdom soon should Priam's force destroy,\nAnd soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!\nBut Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates\nIn fierce contention and in vain debates:\nNow great Achilles from our aid withdraws,\nBy me provoked; a captive maid the cause:\nIf e'er as friends we join, the Trojan wall\nMust shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!\nBut now, ye warriors, take a short repast;\nAnd, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.\nHis sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield,\nAnd every Grecian fix his brazen shield,\nLet all excite the fiery steeds of war,\nAnd all for combat fit the rattling car.\nThis day, this dreadful day, let each contend;\nNo rest, no respite, till the shades descend;\nTill darkness, or till death, shall cover all:\nLet the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;\nTill bathed in sweat be every manly breast,\nWith the huge shield each brawny arm depress'd,\nEach aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,\nAnd each spent courser at the chariot blow.\nWho dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,",

Shall faithless Troy prevail,\nAnd shall our promise to our people fail?\nHow vain the word to Menelaus given\nBy Jove's great daughter and the queen of heaven,\nBeneath his arms that Priam's towers should fall,\nIf warring gods for ever guard the wall!\nMars, red with slaughter, aids our hated foes:\nHaste, let us arm, and force with force oppose!\"\nShe spoke; Minerva burns to meet the war:\nAnd now heaven's empress calls her blazing car.\nAt her command rush forth the steeds divine;\nRich with immortal gold their trappings shine.\nBright Hebe waits; by Hebe, ever young,\nThe whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.\nOn the bright axle turns the bidden wheel\nOf sounding brass; the polished axle steel.\nEight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;\nThe circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,\nSuch as the heavens produce: and round the gold\nTwo brazen rings of work divine were roll'd.\nThe bossy naves of sold silver shone;\nBraces of gold suspend the moving throne:\nThe car, behind, an arching figure bore;\nThe bending concave form'd an arch before.\nSilver the beam, the extended yoke was gold,\nAnd golden reins the immortal coursers hold.\nHerself, impatient, to the ready car,\nThe coursers joins, and breathes revenge and war.\nPallas disrobes; her radiant veil untied,\nWith flowers adorn'd, with art diversified,\n(The laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove,)\nFlows on the pavement of the court of Jove.\nNow heaven's dread arms her mighty limbs invest,\nJove's cuirass blazes on her ample breast;\nDeck'd in sad triumph for the mournful field,\nO'er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield,\nDire, black, tremendous! Round the margin roll'd,\nA fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold:\nHere all the terrors of grim War appear,\nHere rages Force, here tremble Flight and Fear,\nHere storm'd Contention, and here Fury frown'd,\nAnd the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown'd.\nThe massy golden helm she next assumes,\nThat dreadful nods with four o'ershading plumes;\nSo vast, the broad circumference contains\nA hundred armies on a hundred plains.\nThe goddess thus the imperial car ascends;\nShook by her arm the mighty javelin bends,\nPonderous and huge; that when her fury burns,\nProud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.\nSwift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly,\nWhile the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.\nHeaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,[155]\nHeaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours;[156]\nCommission'd in alternate watch they stand,\nThe sun's bright portals and the skies command,\nInvolve in clouds the eternal gates of day,\nOr the dark barrier roll with ease away.\nThe sounding hinges ring, on either side\nThe gloomy volumes, pierced with light, divide.\nThe chariot mounts, where deep in ambient skies,\nConfused, Olympus' hundred heads arise;\nWhere far apart the Thunderer fills his throne,\nO'er all the gods superior and alone.\nThere with her snowy hand the queen restrains\nThe fiery steeds, and thus to Jove complains:\n\"O sire! can no resentment touch thy soul?\nCan Mars rebel, and does no thunder roll?\nWhat lawless rage on yon forbidden plain,\nWhat rash destruction! and what heroes slain!\nVenus, and Ph\u0153bus with the dreadful bow,\nSmile on the slaughter, and enjoy my woe.\nMad, furious power! whose unrelenting mind\nNo god can govern, and no justice bind.\nSay, mighty father! shall we scourge this pride,\nAnd drive from fight the impetuous homicide?\"\nTo whom assenting, thus the Thunderer said:\n\"Go! and the great Minerva be thy aid.\nTo tame the monster-god Minerva knows,\nAnd oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes.\"\nHe said; Saturnia, ardent to obey,\nLash'd her white steeds along the aerial way.\nSwift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,\nBetween the expanded earth and starry poles.\nFar as a shepherd, from some point on high,[157]\nO'er the wide main extends his boundless eye,\nThrough such a space of air, with thundering sound,\nAt every leap the immortal coursers bound\nTroy now they reach'd and touch'd those banks divine,\nWhere silver Simois and Scamander join.\nThere Juno stopp'd, and (her fair steeds unloosed)\nOf air condensed a vapour circumfused:\nFor these, impregnate with celestial dew,\nOn Simois' brink ambrosial herbage grew.\nThence to relieve the fainting Argive throng,\nSmooth as the sailing doves they glide along.\nThe best and bravest of the Grecian band\n(A warlike circle) round Tydides stand.\nSuch was their look as lions bathed in blood,\nOr foaming boars, the terror of the wood.\nHeaven's empress mingles with the mortal crowd,\nAnd shouts, in Stentor's sounding voice, aloud;\nStentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,[158]\nWhose throats surpass'd the force of fifty tongues.\n\"Inglorious Argives! to your race a shame,\nAnd only men in figure and in name!\nOnce from the walls your timorous foes engaged,\nWhile fierce in war divine Achilles raged;\nNow issuing fearless they possess the plain,\nNow win the shores, and scarce the seas remain.\"\nHer speech new fury to their hearts convey'd;\nWhile near Tydides stood the Athenian maid;\nThe king beside his panting steeds she found,\nO'erspent with toil reposing on the ground;\nTo cool his glowing wound he sat apart,\n(The wound inflicted by the Lycian dart.)\nLarge drops of sweat from all his limbs descend,\nBeneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend,\nWhose ample belt, that o'er his shoulder lay,\nHe eased; and wash'd the clotted gore away.\nThe goddess leaning o'er the bending yoke,\nBeside his coursers, thus her silence broke:\n\"Degenerate prince! and not of Tydeus' kind,\nWhose little body lodged a mighty mind;\nForemost he press'd in glorious toils to share,\nAnd scarce refrain'd when I forbade the war.\nAlone, unguarded, once he dared to go,\nAnd feast, incircled by the Theban foe;\nThere braved, and vanquish'd, many a hardy knight;\nSuch nerves I gave him, and such force in fight.\nThou too no less hast been my constant care;\nThy hands I arm'd, and sent thee forth to war:\nBut thee or fear deters, or sloth detains;\nNo drop of all thy father warms thy veins.\"\nThe chief thus answered mild: \"Immortal maid!\nI own thy presence, and confess thy aid.\nNot fear, thou know'st, withholds me from the plains,\nNor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains:\nFrom warring gods thou bad'st me turn my spear,\nAnd Venus only found resistance here.\nHence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,\nLoth I gave way, and warn'd our Argive bands:\nFor Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,\nWith slaughter red, and raging round the field.\"\nThen thus Minerva:\u2014\"Brave Tydides, hear!\nNot Mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.\nFull on the god impel thy foaming horse:\nPallas commands, and Pallas lends thee force.\nRash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,\nAnd every side of wavering combat tries;\nLarge promise makes, and breaks the promise made:\nNow gives the Grecians, now the Trojans aid.\"[159]\nShe said, and to the steeds approaching near,\nDrew from his seat the martial charioteer.\nThe vigorous power the trembling car ascends,\nFierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:\nThe groaning axle bent beneath the load;\nSo great a hero, and so great a god.\nShe snatch'd the reins, she lash'd with all her force,\nAnd full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:\nBut first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread\nBlack Orcus' helmet o'er her radiant head.\n[Illustration: ] DIOMED CASTING HIS SPEAR AT MARS\nJust then gigantic Periphas lay slain,\nThe strongest warrior of the \u00c6tolian train;\nThe god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize\nStretch'd where he fell, and at Tydides flies.\nNow rushing fierce, in equal arms appear\nThe daring Greek, the dreadful god of war!\nFull at the chief, above his courser's head,\nFrom Mars's arm the enormous weapon fled:\nPallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance\nFar from the car the strong immortal lance.\nThen threw the force of Tydeus' warlike son;\nThe javelin hiss'd; the goddess urged it on:\nWhere the broad cincture girt his armour round,\nIt pierced the god: his groin received the wound.\nFrom the rent skin the warrior tugs again\nThe smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:\nLoud as the roar encountering armies yield,\nWhen shouting millions shake the thundering field.\nBoth armies start, and trembling gaze around;\nAnd earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.\nAs vapours blown by Auster's sultry breath,\nPregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,\nBeneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,\nChoke the parch'd earth, and blacken all the skies;\nIn such a cloud the god from combat driven,\nHigh o'er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.\nWild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,\nThere sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,\nShow'd the celestial blood, and with a groan\nThus pour'd his plaints before the immortal throne:\n\"Can Jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,\nAnd brook the furies of this daring day?\nFor mortal men celestial powers engage,\nAnd gods on gods exert eternal rage:\nFrom thee, O father! all these ills we bear,\nAnd thy fell daughter with the shield and spear;\nThou gavest that fury to the realms of light,\nPernicious, wild, regardless of the right.\nAll heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway,\nThy voice we hear, and thy behests obey:\n'Tis hers to offend, and even offending share\nThy breast, thy counsels, thy distinguish'd care:\nSo boundless she, and thou so partial grown,\nWell may we deem the wondrous birth thy own.\nNow frantic Diomed, at her command,\nAgainst the immortals lifts his raging hand:\nThe heavenly Venus first his fury found,\nMe next encountering, me he dared to wound;\nVanquish'd I fled; even I, the god of fight,\nFrom mortal madness scarce was saved by flight.\nElse hadst thou seen me sink on yonder plain,\nHeap'd round, and heaving under loads of slain!\nOr pierced with Grecian darts, for ages lie,\nCondemn'd to pain, though fated not to die.\"\nHim thus upbraiding, with a wrathful look",

doubtful day.\nThe Thracian Acamas his falchion found,\nAnd hew'd the enormous giant to the ground;\nHis thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd\nWhere the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest;\nFix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,\nAnd seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.\nNext Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,\nAxylus, hospitable, rich, and good:\nIn fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)[161]\nHe held his seat! a friend to human race.\nFast by the road, his ever-open door\nObliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.\nTo stern Tydides now he falls a prey,\nNo friend to guard him in the dreadful day!\nBreathless the good man fell, and by his side\nHis faithful servant, old Calesius died.\nBy great Euryalus was Dresus slain,\nAnd next he laid Opheltius on the plain.\nTwo twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,\nFrom a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:\n(Laomedon's white flocks Bucolion fed,\nThat monarch's first-born by a foreign bed;\nIn secret woods he won the naiad's grace,\nAnd two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace:)\nHere dead they lay in all their youthful charms;\nThe ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.\nAstyalus by Polyp\u0153tes fell;\nUlysses' spear Pidytes sent to hell;\nBy Teucer's shaft brave Aretaon bled,\nAnd Nestor's son laid stern Ablerus dead;\nGreat Agamemnon, leader of the brave,\nThe mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,\nWho held in Pedasus his proud abode,[162]\nAnd till'd the banks where silver Satnio flow'd.\nMelanthius by Eurypylus was slain;\nAnd Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.\nUnbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies\nBeneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.\nScared with the din and tumult of the fight,\nHis headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,\nRush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke\nThe shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke;\nWide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,\nFor Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.\nProne on his face he sinks beside the wheel:\nAtrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel;\nThe fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd\nThe victor's knees, and thus his prayer address'd:\n\"O spare my youth, and for the life I owe\nLarge gifts of price my father shall bestow.\nWhen fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,\nThy hollow ships his captive son detain:\nRich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,[163]\nAnd steel well-temper'd, and persuasive gold.\"\nHe said: compassion touch'd the hero's heart\nHe stood, suspended with the lifted dart:\nAs pity pleaded for his vanquish'd prize,\nStern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,\nAnd, furious, thus: \"Oh impotent of mind![164]\nShall these, shall these Atrides' mercy find?\nWell hast thou known proud Troy's perfidious land,\nAnd well her natives merit at thy hand!\nNot one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,\nShall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:\nIlion shall perish whole, and bury all;\nHer babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;[165]\nA dreadful lesson of exampled fate,\nTo warn the nations, and to curb the great!\"\nThe monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address'd,\nTo rigid justice steel'd his brother's breast.\nFierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;\nThe monarch's javelin stretch'd him in the dust,\nThen pressing with his foot his panting heart,\nForth from the slain he tugg'd the reeking dart.\nOld Nestor saw, and roused the warrior's rage;\n\"Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;\nNo son of Mars descend, for servile gains,\nTo touch the booty, while a foe remains.\nBehold yon glittering host, your future spoil!\nFirst gain the conquest, then reward the toil.\"\nAnd now had Greece eternal fame acquired,\nAnd frighted Troy within her walls, retired,\nHad not sage Helenus her state redress'd,\nTaught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.\nWhere Hector stood, with great \u00c6neas join'd,\nThe seer reveal'd the counsels of his mind:\n\"Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay\nThe cares and glories of this doubtful day;\nOn whom your aids, your country's hopes depend;\nWise to consult, and active to defend!\nHere, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,\nTurn back the routed, and forbid the flight,\nEre yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain,\nThe sport and insult of the hostile train.\nWhen your commands have hearten'd every band,\nOurselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand;\nPress'd as we are, and sore of former fight,\nThese straits demand our last remains of might.\nMeanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,\nAnd teach our mother what the gods require:\nDirect the queen to lead the assembled train\nOf Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;[166]\nUnbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,\nWith offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.\nThe largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,\nMost prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\nBefore the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altars led:\nIf so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare,\nAnd far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\nThat mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;\nNot thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,\nSprung though he was from more than mortal bed;\nNot thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,\nIn rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might.\"\nHector obedient heard: and, with a bound,\nLeap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;\nThrough all his host inspiring force he flies,\nAnd bids the thunder of the battle rise.\nWith rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,\nAnd turn the tide of conflict on the foe:\nFierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;\nAll Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;\nSome god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,\nShot down avenging from the vault of stars.\nThen thus aloud: \"Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!\nAnd you whom distant nations send to war!\nBe mindful of the strength your fathers bore;\nBe still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.\nOne hour demands me in the Trojan wall,\nTo bid our altars flame, and victims fall:\nNor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,\nAnd reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.\"\nThis said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;\nThe shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,\nHis neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;\nAnd as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.\nNow paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),[167]\nWhere daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son\nBetween both armies met: the chiefs from far\nObserved each other, and had mark'd for war.\nNear as they drew, Tydides thus began:\n\"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?\nOur eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,\nWhere fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;\nYet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,\nAnd meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.\nUnhappy they, and born of luckless sires,\nWho tempt our fury when Minerva fires!\nBut if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,\nKnow with immortals we no more contend.\nNot long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,\nThat daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.\nBacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,\nWith brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:\nTheir consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,\nWith curling vines and twisted ivy bound;\nWhile Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,\nAnd Thetis' arms received the trembling god.\nNor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;\n(The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)\nDeprived of sight by their avenging doom,\nCheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,\nThen sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,\nA wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!\nI brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth\nSustain thy life, and human be thy birth,\nBold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,\nApproach, and enter the dark gates of death.\"\n\"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,\n(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?\nLike leaves on trees the race of man is found,\nNow green in youth, now withering on the ground;\nAnother race the following spring supplies;\nThey fall successive, and successive rise:\nSo generations in their course decay;\nSo flourish these, when those are pass'd away.\nBut if thou still persist to search my birth,\nThen hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.\n\"A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,\n(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)\n\u00c6olian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,\nIn ancient time the happy wall possess'd,\nThen call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;\nGreat Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,\nWho o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,\nLoved for that valour which preserves mankind.\nThen mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,\nWhose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.\nWith direful jealousy the monarch raged,\nAnd the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.\nFor him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,\nAnd strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:\nIn vain she tempted the relentless youth,\nEndued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.\nFired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,\nAnd begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:\nIncensed he heard, resolving on his fate;\nBut hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:\nTo Lycia the devoted youth he sent,\nWith tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.[168]\nNow bless'd by every power who guards the good,\nThe chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:\nThere Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,\nNine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.\nBut when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,\nThe faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:\nThe fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,\nThe deathful secret to the king reveal'd.\nFirst, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;\nA mingled monster of no mortal kind!\nBehind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;\nA goat's rough body bore a lion's head;\nHer pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;\nHer gaping throat emits infernal fire.\n\"This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,\nAnd trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)\nThen met in arms the Solym\u00e6an crew,[169]\n(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;\nNext the bold Amazons' whole force defied;\nAnd conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.\n\"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,\nAt his return, a treacherous ambush rose,\nWith levell'd spears along the winding shore:\nThere fell they breathless, and return'd no more.\n\"At length the monarch, with repentant grief,\nConfess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;\nHis daughter gave, the stranger to detain,\nWith half the honours of his ample reign:\nThe Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,\nWith woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.\nThere long the chief his happy lot possess'd,\nWith two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;\n(Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love\nCrown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)\nBut when at last, distracted in his mind,\nForsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,\nWide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,\nA long, forlorn, uncomfortable way![170]\nWoes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:\nHis beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;\nHis eldest born by raging Mars was slain,\nIn combat on the Solymaean plain.\nHippolochus survived: from him I came,\nThe honour'd author of my birth and name;\nBy his decree I sought the Trojan town;\nBy his instructions learn to win renown,\nTo stand the first in worth as in command,\nTo add new honours to my native land,\nBefore my eyes my mighty sires to place,\nAnd emulate the glories of our race.\"\nHe spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;\nIn earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,\nThen friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:\n\"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!\nThus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,\nNor stain the sacred friendship of our race.\nKnow, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;\n\u0152neus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:\nOur ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,\nWhere twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.\nThe parting heroes mutual presents left;\nA golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;\n\u0152neus a belt of matchless work bestowed,\nThat rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.\n(This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored\nAmong my treasures, still adorns my board:\nFor Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall\nBeheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)\nMindful of this, in friendship let us join;\nIf heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,\nMy guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.\nEnough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,\nIn the full harvest of yon ample field;\nEnough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;\nBut thou and Diomed be foes no more.\nNow change we arms, and prove to either host\nWe guard the friendship of the line we boast.\"\nThus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,\nTheir hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;\nBrave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,\n(Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)\nFor Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,\nFor which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)\nHe gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,[171]\nA hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.\nMeantime the guardian of the Trojan state,\nGreat Hector, enter'd at the Sc\u00e6an gate.[172]\nBeneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,\nThe Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids\nAround him flock'd, all press'd with pious care\nFor husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.\nHe bids the train in long procession go,\nAnd seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.\nAnd now to Priam's stately courts he came,\nRais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;\nO'er these a range of marble structure runs,\nThe rich pavilions of his fifty sons,\nIn fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,[173]\nOpposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.\nTwelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,\nOf equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.\nHither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen\nOf royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.\n(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face\nSurpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)\nLong in a strict embrace she held her son,\nAnd press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:\n\"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls\nMy son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;\nCom'st thou to supplicate the almighty power\nWith lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?\nStay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,\nIn Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,\nAnd pay due vows to all the gods around.\nThen with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,\nAnd draw new spirits from the generous bowl;\nSpent as thou art with long laborious fight,\nThe brave defender of thy country's right.\"\n\"Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)\nInflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,\nUnnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.\nLet chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice\nTo sprinkle to the gods, its better use.\nBy me that holy office were profaned;\nIll fits it me, with human gore distain'd,\nTo the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,\nOr offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.\nYou, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,\nAnd burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.\nThe largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,\nMost prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\nBefore the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altar led.\nSo may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare;\nAnd far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\nWho mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.\nBe this, O mother, your religious care:\nI go to rouse soft Paris to the war;\nIf yet not lost to all the sense of shame,",

The scene here (except of the\ncelestial machines) lies in the field towards the seashore.\nAurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,\nSprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;\nWhen Jove convened the senate of the skies,\nWhere high Olympus' cloudy tops arise,\nThe sire of gods his awful silence broke;\nThe heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:[189]\n\"Celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,\nHear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;\nThe fix'd decree which not all heaven can move;\nThou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!\nWhat god but enters yon forbidden field,\nWho yields assistance, or but wills to yield,\nBack to the skies with shame he shall be driven,\nGash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;\nOr far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,\nLow in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,\nWith burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,\nAnd lock'd by hell's inexorable doors;\nAs deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,[190]\nAs from that centre to the ethereal world.\nLet him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:\nAnd know, the Almighty is the god of gods.\nLeague all your forces, then, ye powers above,\nJoin all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.\nLet down our golden everlasting chain[191]\nWhose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main\nStrive all, of mortal and immortal birth,\nTo drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth:\nYe strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,\nI heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;\nI fix the chain to great Olympus' height,\nAnd the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!\nFor such I reign, unbounded and above;\nAnd such are men, and gods, compared to Jove.\"",

Success and fame\nAwait on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.\nIn vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,\nWeak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.\nHigh o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,\nAnd pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.\nSoon as before yon hollow ships we stand,\nFight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;\nTill, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,\nAll Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires.\"",

it tore,\nAnd dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.\nHeadlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms\nThe steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.\nHector with grief his charioteer beheld\nAll pale and breathless on the sanguine field:\nThen bids Cebriones direct the rein,\nQuits his bright car, and issues on the plain.\nDreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,\nAnd rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.\nThe youth already strain'd the forceful yew;\nThe shaft already to his shoulder drew;\nThe feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,\nTouch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;\nThere, where the juncture knits the channel bone,\nThe furious chief discharged the craggy stone:\nThe bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,\nAnd his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.\nHe fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,\nAnd screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;\nTill great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore\nThe batter'd archer groaning to the shore.\nTroy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,\nHe arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.\nThe Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,\nOr in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.\nFirst of the foe, great Hector march'd along,\nWith terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.\nAs the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,\nWith beating bosom, and with eager pace,\nHangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,\nGuards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;\nThus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;\nThus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.\nWhen flying they had pass'd the trench profound,\nAnd many a chief lay gasping on the ground;\nBefore the ships a desperate stand they made,\nAnd fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.\nFierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:\nHis eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame\nThat wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:\nDire as the monster, dreadful as the god!\nTheir strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd;\nThen pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid:\n\"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield\nThe avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!\nNow, in this moment of her last despair,\nShall wretched Greece no more confess our care,\nCondemn'd to suffer the full force of fate,\nAnd drain the dregs of heaven's relentless hate?\nGods! shall one raging hand thus level all?\nWhat numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!\nWhat power divine shall Hector's wrath assuage?\nStill swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!\"\nSo spake the imperial regent of the skies;\nTo whom the goddess with the azure eyes:\n\"Long since had Hector stain'd these fields with gore,\nStretch'd by some Argive on his native shore:\nBut he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,\nMocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;\nThe stubborn god, inflexible and hard,\nForgets my service and deserved reward:\nSaved I, for this, his favourite son distress'd,\nBy stern Eurystheus with long labours press'd?\nHe begg'd, with tears he begg'd, in deep dismay;\nI shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.\nOh had my wisdom known this dire event,\nWhen to grim Pluto's gloomy gates he went;\nThe triple dog had never felt his chain,\nNor Styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.\nAverse to me of all his heaven of gods,\nAt Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods;\nTo grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,\nMy hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.\nSome future day, perhaps, he may be moved\nTo call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.\nHaste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;\nMyself will arm, and thunder at thy side.\nThen, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?\n(That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)\nWhen Juno's self, and Pallas shall appear,\nAll dreadful in the crimson walks of war!\nWhat mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,\nExpiring, pale, and terrible no more,\nShall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?\"\nShe ceased, and Juno rein'd the steeds with care:\n(Heaven's awful empress, Saturn's other heir:)\nPallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,\nWith flowers adorn'd, with art immortal crown'd;\nThe radiant robe her sacred fingers wove\nFloats in rich waves, and spreads the court of Jove.\nHer father's arms her mighty limbs invest,\nHis cuirass blazes on her ample breast.\nThe vigorous power the trembling car ascends:\nShook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:\nHuge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns\nProud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.\nSaturnia lends the lash; the coursers fly;\nSmooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.\nHeaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,\nHeaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours.\nCommission'd in alternate watch they stand,\nThe sun's bright portals and the skies command;\nClose, or unfold, the eternal gates of day\nBar heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.\nThe sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.\nProne down the steep of heaven their course they guide.\nBut Jove, incensed, from Ida's top survey'd,\nAnd thus enjoin'd the many-colour'd maid.\n[Illustration: ] JUNO AND MINERVA GOING TO ASSIST THE GREEKS\n\"Thaumantia! mount the winds, and stop their car;\nAgainst the highest who shall wage the war?\nIf furious yet they dare the vain debate,\nThus have I spoke, and what I speak is fate:\nTheir coursers crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,\nTheir car in fragments, scatter'd o'er the sky:\nMy lightning these rebellious shall confound,\nAnd hurl them flaming, headlong, to the ground,\nCondemn'd for ten revolving years to weep\nThe wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.\nSo shall Minerva learn to fear our ire,\nNor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.\nFor Juno, headstrong and imperious still,\nShe claims some title to transgress our will.\"\nSwift as the wind, the various-colour'd maid\nFrom Ida's top her golden wings display'd;\nTo great Olympus' shining gate she flies,\nThere meets the chariot rushing down the skies,\nRestrains their progress from the bright abodes,\nAnd speaks the mandate of the sire of gods.\n\"What frenzy goddesses! what rage can move\nCelestial minds to tempt the wrath of Jove?\nDesist, obedient to his high command:\nThis is his word; and know his word shall stand:\nHis lightning your rebellion shall confound,\nAnd hurl ye headlong, flaming, to the ground;\nYour horses crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,\nYour car in fragments scatter'd o'er the sky;\nYourselves condemn'd ten rolling years to weep\nThe wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.\nSo shall Minerva learn to fear his ire,\nNor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.\nFor Juno, headstrong and imperious still,\nShe claims some title to transgress his will:\nBut thee, what desperate insolence has driven\nTo lift thy lance against the king of heaven?\"\nThen, mounting on the pinions of the wind,\nShe flew; and Juno thus her rage resign'd:\n\"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield\nThe avenging bolt, and shake the saber shield!\nNo more let beings of superior birth\nContend with Jove for this low race of earth;\nTriumphant now, now miserably slain,\nThey breathe or perish as the fates ordain:\nBut Jove's high counsels full effect shall find;\nAnd, ever constant, ever rule mankind.\"\nShe spoke, and backward turn'd her steeds of light,\nAdorn'd with manes of gold, and heavenly bright.\nThe Hours unloosed them, panting as they stood,\nAnd heap'd their mangers with ambrosial food.\nThere tied, they rest in high celestial stalls;\nThe chariot propp'd against the crystal walls,\nThe pensive goddesses, abash'd, controll'd,\nMix with the gods, and fill their seats of gold.",

The heralds bring\nThe cleansing water from the living spring.\nThe youth with wine the sacred goblets crown'd,\nAnd large libations drench'd the sands around.\nThe rite perform'd, the chiefs their thirst allay,\nThen from the royal tent they take their way;\nWise Nestor turns on each his careful eye,\nForbids to offend, instructs them to apply;\nMuch he advised them all, Ulysses most,\nTo deprecate the chief, and save the host.\nThrough the still night they march, and hear the roar\nOf murmuring billows on the sounding shore.\nTo Neptune, ruler of the seas profound,\nWhose liquid arms the mighty globe surround,\nThey pour forth vows, their embassy to bless,\nAnd calm the rage of stern \u00c6acides.\nAnd now, arrived, where on the sandy bay\nThe Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay;\nAmused at ease, the godlike man they found,\nPleased with the solemn harp's harmonious sound.\n(The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came;\nOf polish'd silver was its costly frame.)\nWith this he soothes his angry soul, and sings\nThe immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.\nPatroclus only of the royal train,\nPlaced in his tent, attends the lofty strain:\nFull opposite he sat, and listen'd long,\nIn silence waiting till he ceased the song.\nUnseen the Grecian embassy proceeds\nTo his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.\nAchilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,\nLeap'd from his seat, and laid the harp aside.\nWith like surprise arose Menoetius' son:\nPelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun:\n\"Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.\nOr strong necessity, or urgent fear;\nWelcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;\nTo me more dear than all that bear the name.\"\nWith that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,\nAnd placed in seats with purple carpets spread.\nThen thus\u2014\"Patroclus, crown a larger bowl,\nMix purer wine, and open every soul.\nOf all the warriors yonder host can send,\nThy friend most honours these, and these thy friend.\"\nHe said: Patroclus o'er the blazing fire\nHeaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:\nThe brazen vase Automedon sustains,\nWhich flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.\nAchilles at the genial feast presides,\nThe parts transfixes, and with skill divides.\nMeanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;\nThe tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze:\nThen, when the languid flames at length subside,\nHe strows a bed of glowing embers wide,\nAbove the coals the smoking fragments turns\nAnd sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;\nWith bread the glittering canisters they load,\nWhich round the board Menoetius' son bestow'd;\nHimself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,\nEach portion parts, and orders every rite.\nThe first fat offering to the immortals due,\nAmidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;\nThen each, indulging in the social feast,\nHis thirst and hunger soberly repress'd.\nThat done, to Ph\u0153nix Ajax gave the sign:\nNot unperceived; Ulysses crown'd with wine\nThe foaming bowl, and instant thus began,\nHis speech addressing to the godlike man.\n\"Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!\nNot those more honour'd whom Atrides feasts:\nThough generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,\nThat, Agamemnon's regal tent affords;\nBut greater cares sit heavy on our souls,\nNor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.\nWhat scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!\nThe dead we mourn, and for the living fear;\nGreece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,\nAnd owns no help but from thy saving hands:\nTroy and her aids for ready vengeance call;\nTheir threatening tents already shade our wall:\nHear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,\nAnd point at every ship their vengeful flame!\nFor them the father of the gods declares,\nTheirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.\nSee, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!\nSee! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;\nWhat fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!\nHe waits but for the morn, to sink in flame\nThe ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.\nHeavens! how my country's woes distract my mind,\nLest Fate accomplish all his rage design'd!\nAnd must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay\nIn Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?\nReturn, Achilles: oh return, though late,\nTo save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;\nIf in that heart or grief or courage lies,\nRise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!\nThe day may come, when, all our warriors slain,\nThat heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:\nRegard in time, O prince divinely brave!\nThose wholesome counsels which thy father gave.\nWhen Peleus in his aged arms embraced\nHis parting son, these accents were his last:\n\"'My child! with strength, with glory, and success,\nThy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!\nTrust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage\nTo calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:\nFrom gentler manners let thy glory grow,\nAnd shun contention, the sure source of woe;\nThat young and old may in thy praise combine,\nThe virtues of humanity be thine\u2014'\nThis now-despised advice thy father gave;\nAh! check thy anger;

and if the powers\nGive to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,\nThen shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)\nWith gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.\nBesides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race\nWith copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;\nSuch as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,\nOr yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.\nYet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,\nIf safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,\nThere shalt thou live his son, his honour share,\nAnd with Orestes' self divide his care.\nYet more\u2014three daughters in his court are bred,\nAnd each well worthy of a royal bed:\nLaodice and Iphigenia fair,\nAnd bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:\nHer shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;\nHe asks no presents, no reward for love:\nHimself will give the dower; so vast a store\nAs never father gave a child before.\nSeven ample cities shall confess thy sway,\nThe Enope and Pher\u00e6 thee obey,\nCardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,\nAnd sacred Pedasus, for vines renown'd:\n\u00c6pea fair, the pastures Hira yields,\nAnd rich Antheia with her flowery fields;\nThe whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,\nAlong the verdant margin of the main.\nThere heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;\nBold are the men, and generous is the soil.\nThere shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd,\nAnd rule the tributary realms around.\nSuch are the proffers which this day we bring,\nSuch the repentance of a suppliant king.\nBut if all this, relentless, thou disdain,\nIf honour and if interest plead in vain,\nYet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,\nAnd be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.\nIf no regard thy suffering country claim,\nHear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:\nFor now that chief, whose unresisted ire\nMade nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,\nProud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,\nAnd only triumphs to deserve thy hands.\"\nThen thus the goddess-born: \"Ulysses, hear\nA faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;\nWhat in my secret soul is understood,\nMy tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.\nLet Greece then know, my purpose I retain:\nNor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.\nWho dares think one thing, and another tell,\nMy heart detests him as the gates of hell.\n\"Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,\nWhich nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;\nLong toils, long perils in their cause I bore,\nBut now the unfruitful glories charm no more.\nFight or not fight, a like reward we claim,\nThe wretch and hero find their prize the same.\nAlike regretted in the dust he lies,\nWho yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.\nOf all my dangers, all my glorious pains,\nA life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?\nAs the bold bird her helpless young attends,\nFrom danger guards them, and from want defends;\nIn search of prey she wings the spacious air,\nAnd with the untasted food supplies her care:\nFor thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,\nHer wives, her infants, by my labours saved;\nLong sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,\nAnd sweat laborious days in dust and blood.\nI sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,[207]\nAnd twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:\nThen at Atrides' haughty feet were laid\nThe wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.\nYour mighty monarch these in peace possess'd;\nSome few my soldiers had, himself the rest.\nSome present, too, to every prince was paid;\nAnd every prince enjoys the gift he made:\nI only must refund, of all his train;\nSee what pre-eminence our merits gain!\nMy spoil alone his greedy soul delights:\nMy spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:\nThe woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;\nBut what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?\nWhat to these shores the assembled nations draws,\nWhat calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?\nAre fair endowments and a beauteous face\nBeloved by none but those of Atreus' race?\nThe wife whom choice and passion doth approve,\nSure every wise and worthy man will love.\nNor did my fair one less distinction claim;\nSlave as she was, my soul adored the dame.\nWrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain;\nDeceived for once, I trust not kings again.\nYe have my answer\u2014what remains to do,\nYour king, Ulysses, may consult with you.\nWhat needs he the defence this arm can make?\nHas he not walls no human force can shake?\nHas he not fenced his guarded navy round\nWith piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?\nAnd will not these (the wonders he has done)\nRepel the rage of Priam's single son?\nThere was a time ('twas when for Greece I fought)\nWhen Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought;\nHe kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait\nAchilles' fury at the Sc\u00e6an gate;\nHe tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.\nBut now those ancient enmities are o'er;\nTo-morrow we the favouring gods implore;\nThen shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,\nAnd hear with oars the Hellespont resound.\nThe third day hence shall Pythia greet our sails,[208]\nIf mighty Neptune send propitious gales;\nPythia to her Achilles shall restore\nThe wealth he left for this detested shore:\nThither the spoils of this long war shall pass,\nThe ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:\nMy beauteous captives thither I'll convey,\nAnd all that rests of my unravish'd prey.\nOne only valued gift your tyrant gave,\nAnd that resumed\u2014the fair Lyrnessian slave.\nThen tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,\nAnd learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;\n(For arm'd in impudence, mankind he braves,\nAnd meditates new cheats on all his slaves;\nThough shameless as he is, to face these eyes\nIs what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)\nTell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,\nNor share his council, nor his battle join;\nFor once deceiv'd, was his;

to conquer, these advance;\nAnd mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.\nThe silver Cynthia bade contention rise,\nIn vengeance of neglected sacrifice;\nOn \u0152neus fields she sent a monstrous boar,\nThat levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore:\nThis beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)\nGreat Meleager stretch'd along the plain,\nThen, for his spoils, a new debate arose,\nThe neighbour nations thence commencing foes.\nStrong as they were, the bold Curetes fail'd,\nWhile Meleager's thundering arm prevail'd:\nTill rage at length inflamed his lofty breast\n(For rage invades the wisest and the best).\n\"Cursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,\nAnd in his wife's embrace forgets the fields.\n(She from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair,\nAnd matchless Idas, more than man in war:\nThe god of day adored the mother's charms;\nAgainst the god the father bent his arms:\nThe afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,\nFrom Cleopatra changed their daughter's name,\nAnd call'd Alcyone; a name to show\nThe father's grief, the mourning mother's woe.)\nTo her the chief retired from stern debate,\nBut found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate:\nAlthaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,\nWhose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;\nShe beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath\nOn her own son to wreak her brother's death;\nHell heard her curses from the realms profound,\nAnd the red fiends that walk the nightly round.\nIn vain \u00c6tolia her deliverer waits,\nWar shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.\nShe sent ambassadors, a chosen band,\nPriests of the gods, and elders of the land;\nBesought the chief to save the sinking state:\nTheir prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:\n(Full fifty acres of the richest ground,\nHalf pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd:)\nHis suppliant father, aged \u0152neus, came;\nHis sisters follow'd; even the vengeful dame,\nAlthaea, sues; his friends before him fall:\nHe stands relentless, and rejects them all.\nMeanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies;\nThe walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;\nAt length his wife (a form divine) appears,\nWith piercing cries, and supplicating tears;\nShe paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,\nThe heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,\nThe matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved:\nThe warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.\nThe \u00c6tolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,\nAnd left the chief their broken faith to mourn.\nLearn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,\nNor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;\nAccept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;\nAnd be amongst our guardian gods adored.\"\nThus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:\n\"My second father, and my reverend guide:\nThy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,\nAnd asks no honours from a mortal's hands;\nJove honours me, and favours my designs;\nHis pleasure guides me, and his will confines;\nAnd here I stay (if such his high behest)\nWhile life's warm spirit beats within my breast.\nYet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:\nNo more molest me on Atrides' part:\nIs it for him these tears are taught to flow,\nFor him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?\nA generous friendship no cold medium knows,\nBurns with one love, with one resentment glows;\nOne should our interests and our passions be;\nMy friend must hate the man that injures me.\nDo this, my Ph\u0153nix, 'tis a generous part;\nAnd share my realms, my honours, and my heart.\nLet these return: our voyage, or our stay,\nRest undetermined till the dawning day.\"\nHe ceased; then order'd for the sage's bed\nA warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.\nWith that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,\nAnd thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:\n\"Hence let us go\u2014why waste we time in vain?\nSee what effect our low submissions gain!\nLiked or not liked, his words we must relate,\nThe Greeks expect them, and our heroes wait.\nProud as he is, that iron heart retains\nIts stubborn purpose, and his friends disdains.\nStern and unpitying! if a brother bleed,\nOn just atonement, we remit the deed;\nA sire the slaughter of his son forgives;\nThe price of blood discharged, the murderer lives:\nThe haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,\nAnd gifts can conquer every soul but thine.[213]\nThe gods that unrelenting breast have steel'd,\nAnd cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.\nOne woman-slave was ravish'd from thy arms:\nLo, seven are offer'd, and of equal charms.\nThen hear, Achilles! be of better mind;\nRevere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;\nAnd know the men of all the Grecian host,\nWho honour worth, and prize thy valour most.\"\n\"O soul of battles, and thy people's guide!\n(To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)\nWell hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant's name\nMy rage rekindles, and my soul's on flame:\n'Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:\nDisgraced, dishonour'd, like the vilest slave!\nReturn, then, heroes! and our answer bear,\nThe glorious combat is no more my care;\nNot till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,\nThe blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;\nNot till the flames, by Hector's fury thrown,\nConsume your vessels, and approach my own;\nJust there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,\nThere cease his battle, and there feel our hand.\"\nThis said, each prince a double goblet crown'd,\nAnd cast a large libation on the ground;\nThen to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,\nThe chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.\nMeantime Achilles' slaves prepared a bed,\nWith fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:\nThere, till the sacred morn restored the day,\nIn slumber sweet the reverend Ph\u0153nix lay.\nBut in his inner tent, an ampler space,\nAchilles slept; and in his warm embrace\nFair Diomede of the Lesbian race.\nLast, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,\nWhose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;\nAchilles to his friend consign'd her charms\nWhen Scyros fell before his conquering arms.\nAnd now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,\nPass'd through the hosts, and reach'd the royal tent.\nThen rising all, with goblets in their hands,\nThe peers and leaders of the Achaian bands\nHail'd their return: Atrides first begun:\n\"Say what success? divine Laertes' son!\nAchilles' high resolves declare to all:\nReturns the chief, or must our navy fall?\"\n\"Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)\nFix'd is his wrath, unconquer'd is his pride;\nHe slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,\nAnd, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.\nTo save our army, and our fleets to free,\nIs not his care; but left to Greece and thee.\nYour eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,\nBeneath his oars the whitening billows fly;\nUs too he bids our oars and sails employ,\nNor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;\nFor Jove o'ershades her with his arm divine,\nInspires her war, and bids her glory shine.\nSuch was his word: what further he declared,\nThese sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.\nBut Ph\u0153nix in his tent the chief retains,\nSafe to transport him to his native plains\nWhen morning dawns; if other he decree,\nHis age is sacred, and his choice is free.\"",

my pious hopes succeed)\nThe great Tydides and Ulysses bear,\nReturn'd triumphant with this prize of war.\nYet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)\nThe chiefs outnumber'd by the Trojan train;\nPerhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;\nOr, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more.\"\nScarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,\nAnd spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:\nWith words of friendship and extended hands\nThey greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:\n\"Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,\nThou living glory of the Grecian name!\nSay whence these coursers? by what chance bestow'd,\nThe spoil of foes, or present of a god?\nNot those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,\nThat draw the burning chariot of the day.\nOld as I am, to age I scorn to yield,\nAnd daily mingle in the martial field;\nBut sure till now no coursers struck my sight\nLike these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.\nSome god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,\nBless'd as ye are, and favourites of the skies;\nThe care of him who bids the thunder roar,\nAnd her, whose fury bathes the world with gore.\"\n\"Father! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin'd,)\nThe gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.\nOf Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,\nWhose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;\nSleeping he died, with all his guards around,\nAnd twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.\nThese other spoils from conquer'd Dolon came,\nA wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;\nBy Hector sent our forces to explore,\nHe now lies headless on the sandy shore.\"\nThen o'er the trench the bounding coursers flew;\nThe joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.\nStraight to Tydides' high pavilion borne,\nThe matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:\nThe neighing coursers their new fellows greet,\nAnd the full racks are heap'd with generous wheat.\nBut Dolon's armour, to his ships convey'd,\nHigh on the painted stern Ulysses laid,\nA trophy destin'd to the blue-eyed maid.\nNow from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain\nThey cleanse their bodies in the neighb'ring main:\nThen in the polished bath, refresh'd from toil,\nTheir joints they supple with dissolving oil,\nIn due repast indulge the genial hour,\nAnd first to Pallas the libations pour:\nThey sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,",

shall two warriors only guard their gates,\nRepel an army, and defraud the fates?\"\nThese empty accents mingled with the wind,\nNor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;\nTo godlike Hector and his matchless might\nWas owed the glory of the destined fight.\nLike deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,\nAnd all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;\nThrough the long walls the stony showers were heard,\nThe blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.\nThe spirit of a god my breast inspire,\nTo raise each act to life, and sing with fire!\nWhile Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,\nSecure of death, confiding in despair;\nAnd all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,\nWith unassisting arms deplored the day.\nEven yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain\nThe dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.\nFirst Damasus, by Polyp\u0153tes' steel,\nPierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;\nThe weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!\nThe warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!\nNext Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:\nNor less Leonteus strews the field with death;\nFirst through the belt Hippomachus he gored,\nThen sudden waved his unresisted sword:\nAntiphates, as through the ranks he broke,\nThe falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:\nIamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;\nAnd round him rose a monument of dead.\nMeantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,\nBold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;\nFierce with impatience on the works to fall,\nAnd wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.\nThese on the farther bank now stood and gazed,\nBy Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:\nA signal omen stopp'd the passing host,\nTheir martial fury in their wonder lost.\nJove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;\nA bleeding serpent of enormous size,\nHis talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,\nHe stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:\nMad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,\nIn airy circles wings his painful way,\nFloats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:\nAmidst the host the fallen serpent lies.\nThey, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,\nAnd Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.\nThen first Polydamas the silence broke,\nLong weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:\n\"How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,\nFor words well meant, and sentiments sincere?\nTrue to those counsels which I judge the best,\nI tell the faithful dictates of my breast.\nTo speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,\nIn peace, in war, in council, and in fight;\nAnd all I move, deferring to thy sway,\nBut tends to raise that power which I obey.\nThen hear my words, nor may my words be vain!\nSeek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;\nFor sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,\nAnd thus my mind explains its clear event:\nThe victor eagle, whose sinister flight\nRetards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,\nDismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,\nAllow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;\nThus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,\nThough these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,\nToils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;\nMore woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.\nSo bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;\nFor thus a skilful seer would read the skies.\"\nTo him then Hector with disdain return'd:\n(Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd:)\n\"Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?\nThy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:\nOr if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,\nSure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.\nWhat coward counsels would thy madness move\nAgainst the word, the will reveal'd of Jove?\nThe leading sign, the irrevocable nod,\nAnd happy thunders of the favouring god,\nThese shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind\nBy wandering birds that flit with every wind?\nYe vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,\nOr where the suns arise, or where descend;\nTo right, to left, unheeded take your way,\nWhile I the dictates of high heaven obey.\nWithout a sign his sword the brave man draws,\nAnd asks no omen but his country's cause.\nBut why should'st thou suspect the war's success?\nNone fears it more, as none promotes it less:\nThough all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,\nTrust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.\nTroy and her sons may find a general grave,\nBut thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.\nYet should the fears that wary mind suggests\nSpread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,\nMy javelin can revenge so base a part,\nAnd free the soul that quivers in thy heart.\"\nFurious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,\nCalls on his host; his host obey the call;\nWith ardour follow where their leader flies:\nRedoubling clamours thunder in the skies.\nJove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,\nAnd drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;\nHe fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,\nAnd gives great Hector the predestined day.",

our extended reign,[226]\nWhere Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,\nOur numerous herds that range the fruitful field,\nAnd hills where vines their purple harvest yield,\nOur foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,\nOur feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?\nWhy on those shores are we with joy survey'd,\nAdmired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,\nUnless great acts superior merit prove,\nAnd vindicate the bounteous powers above?\n'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;\nThe first in valour, as the first in place;\nThat when with wondering eyes our martial bands\nBehold our deeds transcending our commands,\nSuch, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,\nWhom those that envy dare not imitate!\nCould all our care elude the gloomy grave,\nWhich claims no less the fearful and the brave,\nFor lust of fame I should not vainly dare\nIn fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.\nBut since, alas! ignoble age must come,\nDisease, and death's inexorable doom,\nThe life, which others pay, let us bestow,\nAnd give to fame what we to nature owe;\nBrave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,\nOr let us glory gain, or glory give!\"\nHe said; his words the listening chief inspire\nWith equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;\nThe troops pursue their leaders with delight,\nRush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.\nMenestheus from on high the storm beheld\nThreatening the fort, and blackening in the field:\nAround the walls he gazed, to view from far\nWhat aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,\nAnd saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,\nOf fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.\nIn vain he calls; the din of helms and shields\nRings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,\nThe brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,\nHeaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground.\nThen thus to Thoos: \"Hence with speed (he said),\nAnd urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;\nTheir strength, united, best may help to bear\nThe bloody labours of the doubtful war:\nHither the Lycian princes bend their course,\nThe best and bravest of the hostile force.\nBut if too fiercely there the foes contend,\nLet Telamon, at least, our towers defend,\nAnd Teucer haste with his unerring bow\nTo share the danger, and repel the foe.\"\nSwift, at the word, the herald speeds along\nThe lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,\nAnd finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,\nOpposed in combat on the dusty shore.\n\"Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!\nYour aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;\nYour strength, united, best may help to bear\nThe bloody labours of the doubtful war:\nThither the Lycian princes bend their course,\nThe best and bravest of the hostile force.\nBut if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,\nAt least, let Telamon those towers defend,\nAnd Teucer haste with his unerring bow\nTo share the danger, and repel the foe.\"\nStraight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,\nAnd thus bespoke his brothers of the war:\n\"Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,\nAnd, brave O\u00efleus, prove your force in fight;\nTo you I trust the fortune of the field,\nTill by this arm the foe shall be repell'd:\nThat done, expect me to complete the day.\nThen with his sevenfold shield he strode away.\"\nWith equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore,\nWhose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.\nHigh on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers,\nLike some black tempest gathering round the towers:\nThe Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,\nPrepared to labour in the unequal fight:\nThe war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise;\nTumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.\nFierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,\nAnd sends the brave Epicles to the shades,\nSarpedon's friend. Across the warrior's way,\nRent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;\nIn modern ages not the strongest swain\nCould heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:\nHe poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,\nIt flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;\nFull on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,\nThe ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.\nAs skilful divers from some airy steep\nHeadlong descend, and shoot into the deep,\nSo falls Epicles; then in groans expires,\nAnd murmuring to the shades the soul retires.\nWhile to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,\nFrom Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;\nThe bearded shaft the destined passage found,\nAnd on his naked arm inflicts a wound.\nThe chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast\nMight stop the progress of his warlike host,\nConceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height\nRetired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.\nDivine Sarpedon with regret beheld\nDisabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;\nHis beating breast with generous ardour glows,\nHe springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.\nAlcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;\nDeep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;\nThen from the yawning wound with fury tore\nThe spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:\nDown sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\nHis brazen armour rings against the ground.\nSwift to the battlement the victor flies,\nTugs with full force, and every nerve applies:\nIt shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;\nThe rolling ruins smoke along the field.\nA mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;\nAnd, like a deluge, rushes in the war.\nAt once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,\nAnd Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;\nFix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,\nAnd through his buckler drove the trembling wood;\nBut Jove was present in the dire debate,\nTo shield his offspring, and avert his fate.\nThe prince gave back, not meditating flight,\nBut urging vengeance, and severer fight;\nThen raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,\nHis fainting squadrons to new fury warms.\n\"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?\nYour former fame and ancient virtue lost!\nThe breach lies open, but your chief in vain\nAttempts alone the guarded pass to gain:\nUnite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:\nThe force of powerful union conquers all.\"\nThis just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;\nThey join, they thicken, and the assault renew:\nUnmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,\nAnd fix'd support the weight of all the war;\nNor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,\nNor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.\nAs on the confines of adjoining grounds,\nTwo stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;\nThey tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,\nOne foot, one inch, of the contended field;\nThus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;\nNor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.\nTheir manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,",

Their whole force he proved,[230]\nResistless when he raged, and, when he stopp'd, unmoved.\nOn him the war is bent, the darts are shed,\nAnd all their falchions wave around his head:\nRepulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires;\nBut with repeated shouts his army fires.\n\"Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way\nThrough yon square body, and that black array:\nStand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,\nStrong as they seem, embattled like a tower;\nFor he that Juno's heavenly bosom warms,\nThe first of gods, this day inspires our arms.\"\nHe said; and roused the soul in every breast:\nUrged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,\nForth march'd Deiphobus; but, marching, held\nBefore his wary steps his ample shield.\nBold Merion aim'd a stroke (nor aim'd it wide);\nThe glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;\nBut pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,\nThe point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.\nThe Trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear,\nOn the raised orb to distance bore the spear.\nThe Greek, retreating, mourn'd his frustrate blow,\nAnd cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;\nThen to the ships with surly speed he went,\nTo seek a surer javelin in his tent.\nMeanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,\nThe tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.\nBy Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,\nThe son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.\nEre yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,\nIn fair Pedaeus' verdant pastures bred,\nThe youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms,\nAnd blest in bright Medesicaste's arms:\n(This nymph, the fruit of Priam's ravish'd joy,\nAllied the warrior to the house of Troy:)\nTo Troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came,\nAnd match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame:\nWith Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne,\nHe lived, beloved and honour'd as his own.\nHim Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:\nHe groans beneath the Telamonian spear.\nAs from some far-seen mountain's airy crown,\nSubdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,\nAnd soils its verdant tresses on the ground;\nSo falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.\nThen Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,\nFrom Hector's hand a shining javelin fled:\nHe saw, and shunn'd the death; the forceful dart\nSung on, and pierced Amphimachus's heart,\nCteatus' son, of Neptune's forceful line;\nVain was his courage, and his race divine!\nProstrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,\nAnd his broad buckler thunders on the ground.\nTo seize his beamy helm the victor flies,\nAnd just had fastened on the dazzling prize,\nWhen Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung;\nFull on the shield's round boss the weapon rung;\nHe felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel,\nSecure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel.\nRepulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain\nThe spoils contested, and bear off the slain.\nBetween the leaders of the Athenian line,\n(Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)\nDeplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;\nImbrius remains the fierce Ajaces' prize.\nAs two grim lions bear across the lawn,\nSnatch'd from devouring hounds, a slaughter'd fawn.\nIn their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,\nAnd sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;\nSo these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead\nStrips his bright arms; O\u00efleus lops his head:\nToss'd like a ball, and whirl'd in air away,\nAt Hector's feet the gory visage lay.\nThe god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,\nAnd pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,\nInspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,\nAnd breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.\nSwift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,\nHe finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,\nHis pensive brow the generous care express'd\nWith which a wounded soldier touch'd his breast,\nWhom in the chance of war a javelin tore,\nAnd his sad comrades from the battle bore;\nHim to the surgeons of the camp he sent:\nThat office paid, he issued from his tent\nFierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,\nIn Thoas' voice, Andr\u00e6mon's valiant son,\nWho ruled where Calydon's white rocks arise,\nAnd Pleuron's chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:\n\"Where's now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,\nOf Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?\"\nTo whom the king: \"On Greece no blame be thrown;\nArms are her trade, and war is all her own.\nHer hardy heroes from the well-fought plains\nNor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:\n'Tis heaven, alas! and Jove's all-powerful doom,\nThat far, far distant from our native home\nWills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!\nOnce foremost in the fight, still prone to lend\nOr arms or counsels, now perform thy best,\nAnd what thou canst not singly, urge the rest.\"\nThus he: and thus the god whose force can make\nThe solid globe's eternal basis shake:\n\"Ah! never may he see his native land,\nBut feed the vultures on this hateful strand,\nWho seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,\nNor dares to combat on this signal day!\nFor this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,\nAnd urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.\nTogether let us battle on the plain;\nTwo, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:\nNot vain the weakest, if their force unite;\nBut ours, the bravest have confess'd in fight.\"\nThis said, he rushes where the combat burns;\nSwift to his tent the Cretan king returns:\nFrom thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,\nAnd clad in arms that lighten'd all the strand,\nFierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,\nLike lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,\nWhich to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,\nOr terrifies the offending world with wars;\nIn streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,\nFrom pole to pole the trail of glory flies:\nThus his bright armour o'er the dazzled throng\nGleam'd dreadful, as the monarch flash'd along.\nHim, near his tent, Meriones attends;\nWhom thus he questions: \"Ever best of friends!\nO say, in every art of battle skill'd,\nWhat holds thy courage from so brave a field?\nOn some important message art thou bound,\nOr bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?\nInglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,\nAnd glows with prospects of th' approaching day.\"\n\"O prince! (Meriones replies) whose care\nLeads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;\nThis speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;\nThe rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield.\"\nTo whom the Cretan: \"Enter, and receive\nThe wonted weapons; those my tent can give;\nSpears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)\nThat shed a lustre round the illumined wall,\nThough I, disdainful of the distant war,\nNor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,\nYet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;\nAnd thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.\nEnter, and see on heaps the helmets roll'd,\nAnd high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold.\"\n\"Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;\nWe too can boast of no ignoble spoils:\nBut those my ship contains; whence distant far,\nI fight conspicuous in the van of war,\nWhat need I more? If any Greek there be\nWho knows not Merion, I appeal to thee.\"\nTo this, Idomeneus: \"The fields of fight\nHave proved thy valour, and unconquer'd might:\nAnd were some ambush for the foes design'd,\nEven there thy courage would not lag behind:\nIn that sharp service, singled from the rest,\nThe fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.\nNo force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;\nHe shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:\nA dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;\nAgainst his bosom beats his quivering heart;\nTerror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;\nWith chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,\nAnd looks a bloodless image of despair!\nNot so the brave\u2014still dauntless, still the same,\nUnchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:\nComposed his thought, determined is his eye,\nAnd fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:\nIf aught disturb the tenour of his breast,\n'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.\n\"In such assays thy blameless worth is known,\nAnd every art of dangerous war thy own.\nBy chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,\nThose wounds were glorious all, and all before;\nSuch as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight\nT'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.\nBut why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,\nStand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?\nGo\u2014from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,\nAnd to their owners send them nobly back.\"\nSwift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear\nAnd, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.",

strong: the fatal tie\nIs stretch'd on both, and close compell'd they die.\nDreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,\nThe bold Idomeneus controls the day.\nFirst by his hand Othryoneus was slain,\nSwell'd with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;\nCall'd by the voice of war to martial fame,\nFrom high Cabesus' distant walls he came;\nCassandra's love he sought, with boasts of power,\nAnd promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.\nThe king consented, by his vaunts abused;\nThe king consented, but the fates refused.\nProud of himself, and of the imagined bride,\nThe field he measured with a larger stride.\nHim as he stalk'd, the Cretan javelin found;\nVain was his breastplate to repel the wound:\nHis dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;\nHis arms resounded as the

methods to advise,\nCome, follow to the fleet thy new allies;\nThere hear what Greece has on her part to say.\"\nHe spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.\nThis Asius view'd, unable to contain,\nBefore his chariot warring on the plain:\n(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,\nImpatient panted on his neck behind:)\nTo vengeance rising with a sudden spring,\nHe hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.\nThe wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,\nFull on his throat discharged the forceful spear:\nBeneath the chin the point was seen to glide,\nAnd glitter'd, extant at the

shore.\nDeprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,\nStands all aghast his trembling charioteer,\nNor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,\nBut falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:\nPierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath\nThe stately car, and labours out his breath.\nThus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)\nRemain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.\nStabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,\nAnd made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.\nThe Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance\nFrom his slope shield the disappointed lance.\nBeneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,\nThick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,\nOn his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,)\nHe lay collected in defensive shade.\nO'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,\nAnd on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.\nEven then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,\nAnd pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast:\nWarm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore\nThe chief, his people's guardian now no more!\n\"Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)\nNor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:\nFor thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,\nThis mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.\"\nHeart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,\nTouch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most.\nGrieved as he was, his pious arms attend,\nAnd his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend:\nTill sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore\nHis honour'd body to the tented shore.\nNor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;\nResolved to perish in his country's cause,\nOr find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom\nTo wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.\nHe sees Alcathous in the front aspire:\nGreat \u00c6syetes was the hero's sire;\nHis spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,\nAnchises' eldest hope, and darling care:\nWho charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart\nWith beauty, sense, and every work of art:\nHe once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy,\nThe fairest she of all the fair of Troy.\nBy Neptune now the hapless hero dies,\nWho covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,\nAnd fetters every limb: yet bent to meet\nHis fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.\nFix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,\nWhile the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.\nBefore the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,\nLong used to ward the death in fighting fields.\nThe riven armour sends a jarring sound;\nHis labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,\nThe long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;\nFast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,\nLife's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.\nThen Idomen, insulting o'er the slain:\n\"Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:\nSee! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;\nThis, my third victim, to the shades I send.\nApproaching now thy boasted might approve,\nAnd try the prowess of the seed of Jove.\nFrom Jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,\nGreat Minos, guardian of his country, came:\nDeucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir;\nHis first-born I, the third from Jupiter:\nO'er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,\nAnd thence my ships transport me through the main:\nLord of a host, o'er all my host I shine,\nA scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line.\"\nThe Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,\nAlone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,\nOr seek auxiliar force; at length decreed\nTo call some hero to partake the deed,\nForthwith \u00c6neas rises to his thought:\nFor him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,\nWhere he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,\nAnd sees superior posts in meaner hands.\nTo him, ambitious of so great an aid,\nThe bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said:\n\"Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,\nIf e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.\nAlcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;\nCome, and the warrior's loved remains defend.\nBeneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,\nOne table fed you, and one roof contain'd.\nThis deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;\nHaste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe.\"\n\u00c6neas heard, and for a space resign'd\nTo tender pity all his manly mind;\nThen rising in his rage, he burns to fight:\nThe Greek awaits him with collected might.\nAs the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,\nArm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,\nWhen the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,\nAttends the tumult, and expects the war;\nO'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;\nFires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,\nHis foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;\nBut most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:\nSo stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,\nAnd met the Trojan with a lowering look.\nAntilochus, Deipyrus, were near,\nThe youthful offspring of the god of war,\nMerion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:\nTo these the warrior sent his voice around.\n\"Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;\nLo, great \u00c6neas rushes to the fight:\nSprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;\nHe fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.\nElse should this hand, this hour decide the strife,\nThe great dispute, of glory, or of life.\"\nHe spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;\nTheir lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade\nAround the chief. \u00c6neas too demands\nTh' assisting forces of his native bands;\nParis, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;\n(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)\nIn order follow all th' embodied train,\nLike Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;\nBefore his fleecy care, erect and bold,\nStalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.\nWith joy the swain surveys them, as he leads\nTo the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:\nSo joys \u00c6neas, as his native band\nMoves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.\nRound dread Alcathous now the battle rose;\nOn every side the steely circle grows;\nNow batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,\nAnd o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.\nAbove the rest, two towering chiefs appear,\nThere great Idomeneus, \u00c6neas here.\nLike gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,\nAnd burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.\nThe Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;\nThe Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:\nSent from an arm so strong, the missive wood\nStuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.\nBut OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;\nThe forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,\nIt ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,\nAnd roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.\nStretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,\nAnd, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.\nThe victor from his breast the weapon tears;\nHis spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.\nThough now unfit an active war to wage,\nHeavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,\nHis listless limbs unable for the course,\nIn standing fight he yet maintains his force;\nTill faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,\nHis tired slow steps he drags from off the field.\nDeiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,\nAnd, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:\nThe javelin err'd, but held its course along,\nAnd pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:\nThe son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,\nAnd gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.\nNor knew the furious father of his fall;\nHigh-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,\nOn golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;\nDetain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.\nNow, where in dust the breathless hero lay,\nFor slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,\nDeiphobus to seize his helmet flies,\nAnd from his temples rends the glittering prize;\nValiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,\nAnd on his loaded arm discharged his spear:\nHe drops the weight, disabled with the pain;\nThe hollow helmet rings against the plain.\nSwift as a vulture leaping on his prey,\nFrom his torn arm the Grecian rent away\nThe reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.\nHis wounded brother good Polites tends;\nAround his waist his pious arms he threw,\nAnd from the rage of battle gently drew:\nHim his swift coursers, on his splendid car,\nRapt from the lessening thunder of the war;\nTo Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,\nAnd sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.\nMeanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,\nHeaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.\nBold Aphareus by great \u00c6neas bled;\nAs toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,\nHe pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd\nBeneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;\nHis shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,\nAnd everlasting slumber seals his eyes.\nAntilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,\nTranspierced his back with a dishonest wound:\nThe hollow vein, that to the neck extends\nAlong the chine, his eager javelin rends:\nSupine he falls, and to his social train\nSpreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.\nThv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,\nFrom his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;\nHis time observed; for closed by foes around,\nOn all sides thick the peals of arms resound.\nHis shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,\nBut he impervious and untouch'd remains.\n(Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage\nThis youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)\nIn arms intrepid, with the first he fought,\nFaced every foe, and every danger sought;\nHis winged lance, resistless as the wind,\nObeys each motion of the master's mind!\nRestless it flies, impatient to be free,\nAnd meditates the distant enemy.\nThe son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,\nAnd struck his target with the brazen spear\nFierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,\nAnd blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:\nIn the broad buckler half the weapon stood,\nSplinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.\nDisarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;\nBut Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,\nDeep in the belly's rim an entrance found,\nWhere sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.\nBending he fell, and doubled to the ground,\nLay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,\nWhile death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,\nHis bulk enormous on the field displays;\nHis heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.\nThe spear the conqueror from his body drew,\nAnd death's dim shadows swarm before his view.\nNext brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:\nKing Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,\nAnd smote his temples with an arm so strong,\nThe helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:\nThere for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;\nFor dark in death the godlike owner lies!\nRaging with grief, great Menelaus burns,\nAnd fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:\nThat shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;\nAnd this stood adverse with the bended bow:\nFull on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,\nBut harmless bounded from the plated steel.\nAs on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,\n(The winds collected at each open door,)\nWhile the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,\nLight leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:\nSo from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,\nRepell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.\nAtrides, watchful of the unwary foe,\nPierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.\nAnd nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand\nTrail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:\nBut good Agenor gently from the wound\nThe spear solicits, and the bandage bound;\nA sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,\nAt once the tent and ligature supplied.\nBehold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,\nSprings through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,\nGreat Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:\nHigh-towering in the front, the warrior came.\nFirst the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;\nThe lance far distant by the winds was blown.\nNor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:\nPisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.\nNot so discouraged, to the future blind,\nVain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;\nDauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord\nLike lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.\nHis left arm high opposed the shining shield:\nHis right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;\n(An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,\nDistinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)\nThis on the helm discharged a noble blow;\nThe plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,\nShorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:\nDeep through his front the weighty falchion fell;\nThe crashing bones before its force gave way;\nIn dust and blood the groaning hero lay:\nForced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,\nThe clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.\nAnd fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,\nTore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:\n\"Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;\nO race perfidious, who delight in war!\nAlready noble deeds ye have perform'd;\nA princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:\nIn such bold feats your impious might approve,\nWithout th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.\nThe violated rites, the ravish'd dame;\nOur heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,\nCrimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,\nAnd whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.\nO thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,\nAbove the thought of man, supremely wise!\nIf from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,\nFrom whence this favour to an impious foe?\nA godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,\nStill breathing rapine, violence, and lust?\nThe best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;\nSleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;\nThe feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,\nEven the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.\nBut Troy for ever reaps a dire delight\nIn thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.\"\nThis said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)\nThe bloody armour, which his train received:\nThen sudden mix'd among the warring crew,\nAnd the bold son of Pyl\u00e6menes slew.\nHarpalion had through Asia travell'd far,\nFollowing his martial father to the war:\nThrough filial love he left his native shore,\nNever, ah, never to behold it more!\nHis unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling\nAgainst the target of the Spartan king;\nThus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,\nAnd turns around his apprehensive eyes.\nHim, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,\nThe shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.\nBeneath the bone the glancing point descends,\nAnd, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:\nSunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,\nAnd in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;\n(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)\nWhile life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.\nHim on his car the Paphlagonian train\nIn slow procession bore from off the plain.\nThe pensive father, father now no more!\nAttends the mournful pomp along the shore;\nAnd unavailing tears profusely shed;\nAnd, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.\nParis from far the moving sight beheld,\nWith pity soften'd and with fury swell'd:\nHis honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,\nAnd loved of all the Paphlagonian race!\nWith his full strength he bent his angry bow,\nAnd wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.\nA chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,\nFor riches much, and more for virtue famed.\nWho held his seat in Corinth's stately town;\nPolydus' son, a seer of old renown.\nOft had the father told his early doom,\nBy arms abroad, or slow disease at home:\nHe climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,\nAnd chose the certain glorious path to death.\nBeneath his ear the pointed arrow went;\nThe soul came issuing at the narrow vent:\nHis limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,\nAnd everlasting darkness shades him round.\nNor knew great Hector how his legions yield,\n(Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)\nWide on the left the force of Greece commands,\nAnd conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands;\nWith such a tide superior virtue sway'd,\nAnd he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.\nBut in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd,\nWhere first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;\nThere, on the margin of the hoary deep,\n(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.\nAnd where low walls confine the beating tides,\nWhose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;\nWhere late in fight both foot and horse engaged,\nAnd all the thunder of the battle raged,)\nThere join'd, the whole B\u0153otian strength remains,\nThe proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,\nLocrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;\nBut join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.\nThe flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;\nBias and great Menestheus at their head:\nMeges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,\nAnd Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:\nThe Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,\nAnd brave Podarces, active in the fight.\nThis drew from Phylacus his noble line;\nIphiclus' son: and that (O\u00efleus) thine:\n(Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace;\nHe dwelt far distant from his native place,\nBy his fierce step-dame from his father's reign\nExpell'd and exiled for her brother slain:)\nThese rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,\nMix'd with B\u0153otians, on the shores of Troy.\nNow side by side, with like unwearied care,\nEach Ajax laboured through the field of war:\nSo when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,\nForce the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,\nJoin'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,\nAnd trace large furrows with the shining share;\nO'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,\nAnd streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.\nA train of heroes followed through the field,\nWho bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;\nWhene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,\nTired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.\nNo following troops his brave associate grace:\nIn close engagement an unpractised race,\nThe Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,\nNor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;\nBut skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,\nOr whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,\nDexterous with these they aim a certain wound,\nOr fell the distant warrior to the ground.\nThus in the van the Telamonian train,\nThrong'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:\nFar in the rear the Locrian archers lie,\nWhose stones and arrows intercept the sky,\nThe mingled tempest on the foes they pour;\nTroy's scattering orders open to the shower.\nNow had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,\nAnd the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired;\nBut sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,\nAddress'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:\n\"Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend\nImpartial audience to a faithful friend;\nTo gods and men thy matchless worth is known,\nAnd every art of glorious war thy own;\nBut in cool thought and counsel to excel,\nHow widely differs this from warring well!\nContent with what the bounteous gods have given,\nSeek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.\nTo some the powers of bloody war belong,\nTo some sweet music and the charm of song;\nTo few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd\nA wise, extensive, all-considering mind;\nTheir guardians these, the nations round confess,\nAnd towns and empires for their safety bless.\nIf Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,\nAttend, O Hector! what I judge the best,\nSee, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,\nAnd war's whole fury burns around thy head.\nBehold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,\nHow many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!\nWhat troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!\nAnd what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!\nHere cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings\nConvoked to council, weigh the sum of things.\nWhether (the gods succeeding our desires)\nTo yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;\nOr quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,\nContented with the conquest of the day.\nI fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,\nPay the large debt of last revolving sun;\nAchilles, great Achilles, yet remains\nOn yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!\"\nThe counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,\nLeap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;\nSwift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.\n\"To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,\nAnd here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;\nWhere yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,\nAnd hasten back to end the doubtful day.\"\nThis said, the towering chief prepares to go,\nShakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,\nAnd seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.\nThrough all his host, inspiring force, he flies,\nAnd bids anew the martial thunder rise.\nTo Panthus' son, at Hector's high command\nHaste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:\nBut round the battlements, and round the plain,\nFor many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain;\nDeiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,\nNor Asius' son, nor Asius' self appear:\nFor these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,\nSome cold in death, some groaning on the ground;\nSome low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;\nHigh on the wall some breathed their souls away.\nFar on the left, amid the throng he found\n(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)\nThe graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,\nOpprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved:\n\"Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,\nAs smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!\nWhere is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?\nThe godlike father, and th' intrepid son?\nThe force of Helenus, dispensing fate;\nAnd great Othryoneus, so fear'd of late?\nBlack fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods,\nImperial Troy from her foundations nods;\nWhelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall,\nAnd one devouring vengeance swallow all.\"\nWhen Paris thus: \"My brother and my friend,\nThy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,",

without thy powerful will;\nLo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!\nYet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:\nThe Greeks' main body to the fleet command;\nBut let the few whom brisker spirits warm,\nStand the first onset, and provoke the storm.\nThus point your arms; and when such foes appear,\nFierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear.\"\nThe warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,\nThickening their ranks, and form a deep array.\nEach Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,\nThe valiant leader of the Cretan band;\nAnd Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,\nApproach the foe, and meet the coming fight.\nBehind, unnumber'd multitudes attend,\nTo flank the navy, and the shores defend.\nFull on the front the pressing Trojans bear,\nAnd Hector first came towering to the war.\nPh\u0153bus himself the rushing battle led;\nA veil of clouds involved his radiant head:\nHigh held before him, Jove's enormous shield\nPortentous shone, and shaded all the field;\nVulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd,\nTo scatter hosts and terrify mankind,\nThe Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise\nFrom different parts, and mingle in the skies.\nDire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,\nAnd arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;\nThese drink the life of generous warriors slain:\nThose guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.\nAs long as Ph\u0153bus bore unmoved the shield,\nSat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;\nBut when aloft he shakes it in the skies,\nShouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,\nDeep horror seizes every Grecian breast,\nTheir force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.\nSo flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,\nNo swain to guard them, and no day to guide,\nWhen two fell lions from the mountain come,\nAnd spread the carnage through the shady gloom.\nImpending Ph\u0153bus pours around them fear,\nAnd Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.\nHeaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,\nFirst great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;\nOne to the bold B\u0153otians ever dear,\nAnd one Menestheus' friend and famed compeer.\nMedon and Iasus, \u00c6neas sped;\nThis sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;\nBut hapless Medon from O\u00efleus came;\nHim Ajax honour'd with a brother's name,\nThough born of lawless love: from home expell'd,\nA banish'd man, in Phylac\u00e8 he dwell'd,\nPress'd by the vengeance of an angry wife;\nTroy ends at last his labours and his life.\nMecystes next Polydamas o'erthrew;\nAnd thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.\nBy Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,\nPierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.\nPolites' arm laid Echius on the plain;\nStretch'd on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.\nThe Greeks dismay'd, confused, disperse or fall,\nSome seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.\nWhile these fly trembling, others pant for breath,\nAnd o'er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.\nOn rush'd bold Hector, gloomy as the night;\nForbids to plunder, animates the fight,\nPoints to the fleet: \"For, by the gods! who flies,[240]\nWho dares but linger, by this hand he dies;\nNo weeping sister his cold eye shall close,\nNo friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.\nWho stops to plunder at this signal hour,\nThe birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour.\"\nFurious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;\nThe coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;\nThe hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;\nThe horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!\nApollo, planted at the trench's bound,\nPush'd at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:\nRoll'd in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;\nA sudden road! a long and ample way.\nO'er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)\nNow steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.\nThe wondering crowds the downward level trod;\nBefore them flamed the shield, and march'd the god.\nThen with his hand he shook the mighty wall;\nAnd lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:\nEasy as when ashore an infant stands,\nAnd draws imagined houses in the sands;\nThe sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,\nSweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away:\nThus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls;\nThe toil of thousands in a moment falls.\nThe Grecians gaze around with wild despair,\nConfused, and weary all the powers with prayer:\nExhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;\nAnd urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.\nExperienced Nestor chief obtests the skies,\nAnd weeps his country with a father's eyes.\n\"O Jove! if ever, on his native shore,\nOne Greek enrich'd thy shrine with offer'd gore;\nIf e'er, in hope our country to behold,\nWe paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;\nIf e'er thou sign'st our wishes with thy nod:\nPerform the promise of a gracious god!\nThis day preserve our navies from the flame,\nAnd save the relics of the Grecian name.\"\nThus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,\nAnd peals of thunder shook the firmament.\nPresumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign,\nAnd catch'd new fury at the voice divine.\nAs, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,\nThe roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,\nAbove the sides of some tall ship ascend,\nIts womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:\nThus loudly roaring, and o'erpowering all,\nMount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;\nLegions on legions from each side arise:\nThick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.\nFierce on the ships above, the cars below,\nThese wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.\nWhile thus the thunder of the battle raged,",

With thundering sound\nThe warrior falls, extended on the ground.\nIn rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:\nBut Hector's voice excites his kindred train;\nThe hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,\nFierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.\nHe (ere to Troy the Grecians cross'd the main)\nFed his large oxen on Percot\u00e8's plain;\nBut when oppress'd, his country claim'd his care,\nReturn'd to Ilion, and excell'd in war;\nFor this, in Priam's court, he held his place,\nBeloved no less than Priam's royal race.\nHim Hector singled, as his troops he led,\nAnd thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.\n\"Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;\nAnd is it thus our royal kinsman dies?\nO'ermatch'd he falls; to two at once a prey,\nAnd lo! they bear the bloody arms away!\nCome on\u2014a distant war no longer wage,\nBut hand to hand thy country's foes engage:\nTill Greece at once, and all her glory end;\nOr Ilion from her towery height descend,\nHeaved from the lowest stone; and bury all\nIn one sad sepulchre, one common fall.\"\nHector (this said) rush'd forward on the foes:\nWith equal ardour Melanippus glows:\nThen Ajax thus\u2014\"O Greeks! respect your fame,\nRespect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:\nLet mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,\nAnd catch from breast to breast the noble fire,\nOn valour's side the odds of combat lie;\nThe brave live glorious, or lamented die;\nThe wretch that trembles in the field of fame,\nMeets death, and worse than death, eternal shame.\"\nHis generous sense he not in vain imparts;\nIt sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:\nThey join, they throng, they thicken at his call,\nAnd flank the navy with a brazen wall;\nShields touching shields, in order blaze above,\nAnd stop the Trojans, though impell'd by Jove.\nThe fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.\nWarms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.\n\"Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,\nSo strong to fight, so active to pursue?\nWhy stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?\nLift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed.\"\nHe said; and backward to the lines retired;\nForth rush'd the youth with martial fury fired,\nBeyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,\nAnd round the black battalions cast his view.\nThe troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,\nWhile the swift javelin hiss'd along in air.\nAdvancing Melanippus met the dart\nWith his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:\nThundering he falls; his falling arms resound,\nAnd his broad buckler rings against the ground.\nThe victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:\nThus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies,\nAnd rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart\nThe distant hunter sent into his heart.\nObserving Hector to the rescue flew;\nBold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.\nSo when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,\nHas torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,\nWhile conscious of the deed, he glares around,\nAnd hears the gathering multitude resound,\nTimely he flies the yet-untasted food,\nAnd gains the friendly shelter of the wood:\nSo fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,\nWhile stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;\nBut enter'd in the Grecian ranks, he turns\nHis manly breast, and with new fury burns.\nNow on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,\nFierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:\nThe sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer,\nThe Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair;\nBut lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands,\nSwells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.\nOn Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,\nTo view the navy blazing to the skies;\nThen, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,\nThe Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.\nThese fates revolved in his almighty mind,\nHe raises Hector to the work design'd,\nBids him with more than mortal fury glow,\nAnd drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.\nSo Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,\nShakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.\nNot with more rage a conflagration rolls,\nWraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.\nHe foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow\nLike fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:\nThe radiant helmet on his temple burns,\nWaves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:\nFor Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,\nAnd cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.\nUnhappy glories! for his fate was near,\nDue to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:\nYet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,\nAnd gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!\nNow all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes\nBurn at each foe, and single every prize;\nStill at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,\nHe points his ardour, and exerts his might.\nThe Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,\nOn all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:\nSo some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,[241]\nBy winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,\nUnmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,\nAnd sees the watery mountains break below.\nGirt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall\nLike fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:\nBursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,\nAnd, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;\nWhite are the decks with foam; the winds aloud\nHowl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:\nPale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;\nAnd instant death on every wave appears.\nSo pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,\nThe chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.\nAs when a lion, rushing from his den,\nAmidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,\n(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,\nAt large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)\nLeaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;\nThe trembling herdsman far to distance flies;\nSome lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)\nHe singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.\nThus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew\nAll Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:\nMycenian Periphes, a mighty name,\nIn wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;\nThe minister of stern Eurystheus' ire\nAgainst Alcides, Copreus was his sire:\nThe son redeem'd the honours of the race,\nA son as generous as the sire was base;\nO'er all his country's youth conspicuous far\nIn every virtue, or of peace or war:\nBut doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!\nAgainst the margin of his ample shield\nHe struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;\nSupine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.\nOn the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,\nAnd plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.\nHis circling friends, who strove to guard too late\nThe unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.\nChased from the foremost line, the Grecian train\nNow man the next, receding toward the main:\nWedged in one body at the tents they stand,\nWall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.\nNow manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;\nNow fear itself confines them to the fight:\nMan courage breathes in man; but Nestor most\n(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)\nExhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;\nAnd by their parents, by themselves implores.\n\"Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame\nWith mutual honour, and with mutual shame!\nThink of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care\nYour wives, your infants, and your parents share:\nThink of each living father's reverend head;\nThink of each ancestor with glory dead;\nAbsent, by me they speak, by me they sue,\nThey ask their safety, and their fame, from you:\nThe gods their fates on this one action lay,\nAnd all are lost, if you desert the day.\"\nHe spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;",

Next, Thoas was thy chance;\nThy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.\nPhylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)\nHis blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,\nTore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;\nIn darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.\nIn equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,\nAnd two bold brothers of the Lycian band:\nBy great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,\nPierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,\nKind Maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,\nDefends the breathless carcase on the ground;\nFurious he flies, his murderer to engage:\nBut godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,\nBetween his arm and shoulder aims a blow;\nHis arm falls spouting on the dust below:\nHe sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er:\nAnd vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.\nSlain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,\nSarpedon's friends, Amisodarus' seed;\nAmisodarus, who, by Furies led,\nThe bane of men, abhorr'd Chimaera bred;\nSkill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire,\nAnd pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.\nStopp'd in the tumult Cleobulus lies,\nBeneath O\u00efleus' arm, a living prize;\nA living prize not long the Trojan stood;\nThe thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:\nPlunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;\nBlack death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.\nAmid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,\nLycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;\nIn vain their javelins at each other flew,\nNow, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.\nOn the plumed crest of his B\u0153otian foe\nThe daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow;\nThe sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped\nFull on the juncture of the neck and head:\nThe head, divided by a stroke so just,\nHung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.\nO'ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,\nPierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;\nBack from the car he tumbles to the ground:\nHis swimming eyes eternal shades surround.\nNext Erymas was doom'd his fate to feel,\nHis open'd mouth received the Cretan steel:\nBeneath the brain the point a passage tore,\nCrash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore:\nHis mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;\nHe sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.\nAs when the flocks neglected by the swain,\nOr kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain,\nA troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,\nAnd rend the trembling, unresisting prey:\nThus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;\nTroy fled, unmindful of her former fame.\nBut still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd,\nStill, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.\nThe Trojan chief, experienced in the field,\nO'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,\nObserved the storm of darts the Grecians pour,\nAnd on his buckler caught the ringing shower:\nHe sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,\nYet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.\nAs when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,\nAnd rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,\nDark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies,\nAnd shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:\nSo from the ships, along the dusky plain,\nDire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.\nEven Hector fled; through heads of disarray\nThe fiery coursers forced their lord away:\nWhile far behind his Trojans fall confused;\nWedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:\nChariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes\nShock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.\nIn vain they labour up the steepy mound;\nTheir charioteers lie foaming on the ground.\nFierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;\nTumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;",

as the spear was shook,\nHe fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.\nNext on Eryalus he flies; a stone,\nLarge as a rock, was by his fury thrown:\nFull on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,\nAnd burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:\nProne to the ground the breathless warrior fell,\nAnd death involved him with the shades of hell.\nThen low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;\nIpheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;\nAmphoterus and Erymas succeed;\nAnd last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.\nWhere'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread\nIn heaps on heaps a monument of dead.\nWhen now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld\nGrovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,\nWith this reproach his flying host he warms:\n\"Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!\nForsake, inglorious, the contended plain;\nThis hand unaided shall the war sustain:\nThe task be mine this hero's strength to try,\nWho mows whole troops, and makes an army fly.\"\nHe spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:\nPatroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.\nAs when two vultures on the mountain's height\nStoop with resounding pinions to the fight;\nThey cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;\nThe desert echoes, and the rocks reply:\nThe warriors thus opposed in arms, engage\nWith equal clamours, and with equal rage.\nJove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen,\nHe thus bespoke his sister and his queen:\n\"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,[245]\nMy godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:\nAlready on the verge of death he stands,\nHis life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,\nWhat passions in a parent's breast debate!\nSay, shall I snatch him from impending fate,\nAnd send him safe to Lycia, distant far\nFrom all the dangers and the toils of war;\nOr to his doom my bravest offspring yield,\nAnd fatten, with celestial blood, the field?\"\nThen thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:\n\"What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!\nShort is the date prescribed to mortal man;\nShall Jove for one extend the narrow span,\nWhose bounds were fix'd before his race began?\nHow many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,\nBefore proud Ilion must resign their breath!\nWere thine exempt, debate would rise above,\nAnd murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.\nGive the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;\nAnd when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,\nLet Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,\nThe breathless body to his native land.\nHis friends and people, to his future praise,\nA marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,\nAnd lasting honours to his ashes give;\nHis fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live.\"\nShe said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,\nAssents to fate, and ratifies the doom.\nThen touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd\nA shower of blood o'er all the fatal field:\nThe god, his eyes averting from the plain,\nLaments his son, predestined to be slain,\nFar from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.\nNow met in arms, the combatants appear;\nEach heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;\nFrom strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled,\nAnd pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed;\nThe nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,\nHe falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.\nTwo sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:\nThe first aloof with erring fury flew,\nThe next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed,\nThe generous Pedasus of Theban breed:\nFix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,\nRoll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.\nHis sudden fall the entangled harness broke;\nEach axle crackled, and the chariot shook:\nWhen bold Automedon, to disengage\nThe starting coursers, and restrain their rage,\nDivides the traces with his sword, and freed\nThe encumbered chariot from the dying steed:\nThe rest move on, obedient to the rein:\nThe car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.\nThe towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:\nAnd first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,\nWhich o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,\nAnd spent in empty air its dying force.\nNot so Patroclus' never-erring dart;\nAim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,\nWhere the strong fibres bind the solid heart.\nThen as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,\nOr pine (fit mast for some great admiral)\nNods to the axe, till with a groaning sound\nIt sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,\nThus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,\nBefore his chariot stretch'd his form divine:\nHe grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,\nAnd, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.\nSo lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,\nWhile the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws\nThe trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;\nDeep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.\nThen to the leader of the Lycian band\nThe dying chief address'd his last command;\n\"Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare\nThe glorious dangers of destructive war,\nTo lead my troops, to combat at their head,\nIncite the living, and supply the dead.\nTell them, I charged them with my latest breath\nNot unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.\nWhat grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,\nIf these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!\nThen as a friend, and as a warrior fight;\nDefend my body, conquer in my right:\nThat, taught by great examples, all may try\nLike thee to vanquish, or like me to die.\"\nHe ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,\nAnd his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.\nThe insulting victor with disdain bestrode\nThe prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;\nThen drew the weapon from his panting heart,\nThe reeking fibres clinging to the dart;\nFrom the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,\nAnd the soul issued in the purple flood.\nHis flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,\nUnguided now, their mighty master slain.\nAll-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,\nUnhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:\nHis painful arm, yet useless with the smart\nInflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,\nSupported on his better hand he stay'd:\nTo Ph\u0153bus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:\n\"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,\nOr sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,\nPowerful alike to ease the wretch's smart;\nO hear me! god of every healing art!\nLo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,\nThat thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,\nI stand unable to sustain the spear,\nAnd sigh, at distance from the glorious war.\nLow in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,\nNor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;\nBut thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,\nTo guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend:\nFor thou, though distant, canst restore my might,\nTo head my Lycians, and support the fight.\"\nApollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,\nHis heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;\nHe drew the dolours from the wounded part,\nAnd breathed a spirit in his rising heart.\nRenew'd by art divine, the hero stands,\nAnd owns the assistance of immortal hands.\nFirst to the fight his native troops he warms,\nThen loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;\nWith ample strides he stalks from place to place;\nNow fires Agenor, now Polydamas:\n\u00c6neas next, and Hector he accosts;\nInflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.\n\"What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?\nOh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!\nThose generous friends, who, from their country far,\nBreathe their brave souls out in another's war.\nSee! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,\nIn action valiant, and in council wise,\nWho guarded right, and kept his people free;\nTo all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!\nStretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains,\nO save from hostile rage his loved remains!\nAh let not Greece his conquer'd trophies boast,\nNor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!\"\nHe spoke: each leader in his grief partook:\nTroy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.\nTransfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown\nAt once his country's pillar, and their own;\nA chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall\nA host of heroes, and outshined them all.\nFired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,\nAnd with superior vengeance greatly glows.\nBut o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,\nAnd rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:\n\"Heroes, be men; be what you were before;\nOr weigh the great occasion, and be more.\nThe chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,\nLies pale in death, extended on the field.\nTo guard his body Troy in numbers flies;\n'Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.\nHaste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,\nAnd send the living Lycians to the dead.\"\nThe heroes kindle at his fierce command;\nThe martial squadrons close on either hand:\nHere Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,\nThessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.\nWith horrid shouts they circle round the slain;\nThe clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.\nGreat Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,\nO'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,\nAnd round his son confounds the warring hosts,\nHis fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.\nNow Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;\nAgacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls;\nWho chased for murder thence a suppliant came\nTo Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;\nNow sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid,\nHe pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.\nSoon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,\nA rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;\nHurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain\nHis shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.\nFierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,\nAnd, like an eagle darting at his game,\nSprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.\nWhat grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,\nO generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,\nAt Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,\nWhich sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near\nThat arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.\nFar as an able hand a lance can throw,\nOr at the lists, or at the fighting foe;\nSo far the Trojans from their lines retired;\nTill Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.\nThen Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,\nThe only hope of Chalcon's trembling age;\nWide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,\nWith stately seats, and riches blest in vain:\nHim, bold with youth, and eager to pursue\nThe flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;\nPierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,\nHe fell, and falling made the fields resound.\nThe Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;\nWith conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,\nAnd crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;\nAn iron circle round the carcase grows.\nThen brave Laogonus resign'd his breath,\nDespatch'd by Merion to the shades of death:\nOn Ida's holy hill he made abode,\nThe priest of Jove, and honour'd like his god.\nBetween the jaw and ear the javelin went;\nThe soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.\nHis spear \u00c6neas at the victor threw,\nWho stooping forward from the death withdrew;\nThe lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,\nAnd trembling struck, and rooted in the field;\nThere yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,\nSent by the great \u00c6neas' arm in vain.\n\"Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)\nAnd skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,\nMy spear, the destined passage had it found,\nHad fix'd thy active vigour to the ground.\"\n\"O valiant leader of the Dardan host!\n(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)\nStrong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,\nAn arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.\nAnd if to this my lance thy fate be given,\nVain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:\nThis, instant, sends thee down to Pluto's coast;\nMine is the glory, his thy parting ghost.\"\n\"O friend (Menoetius' son this answer gave)\nWith words to combat, ill befits the brave;\nNot empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,\nYour swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.\nTo speak, beseems the council; but to dare\nIn glorious action, is the task of war.\"\nThis said, Patroclus to the battle flies;\nGreat Merion follows, and new shouts arise:\nShields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;\nAnd thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.\nAs through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,\nThe labours of the woodman's axe resound;\nBlows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,\nWhile crackling forests fall on every side:\nThus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,\nSo fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.\nNow great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,\nHis heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,\nAnd stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,\nLies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead.\nHis long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,\nOn every side the busy combat grows;\nThick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode\n(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)\nThe buzzing flies, a persevering train,\nIncessant swarm, and chased return again.\nJove view'd the combat with a stern survey,\nAnd eyes that flash'd intolerable day.\nFix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates\nThe vengeance due, and meditates the fates:\nWhether to urge their prompt effect, and call\nThe force of Hector to Patroclus' fall,\nThis instant see his short-lived trophies won,\nAnd stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd son;\nOr yet, with many a soul's untimely flight,\nAugment the fame and horror of the fight.\nTo crown Achilles' valiant friend with praise\nAt length he dooms; and, that his last of days\nShall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;\nNor unattended see the shades below.\nThen Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay;\nHe mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;\nSunk with Troy's heavy fates, he sees decline\nThe scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.\nThen, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,\nAnd left their monarch with the common dead:\nAround, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall\nOf carnage rises, as the heroes fall.\n(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain\nThe prize contested, and despoil the slain.\nThe radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;\nPatroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.\nThen thus to Ph\u0153bus, in the realms above,\nSpoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:\n\"Descend, my Ph\u0153bus! on the Phrygian plain,\nAnd from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;\nThen bathe his body in the crystal flood,\nWith dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with blood;\nO'er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,\nAnd with celestial robes adorn the dead.\nThose rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath\nTo the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.\nThey to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;\nHis friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:\nWhat honour mortals after death receive,\nThose unavailing honours we may give!\"\n[Illustration: ] SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO\nLYCIA\nApollo bows, and from mount Ida's height,\nSwift to the field precipitates his flight;\nThence from the war the breathless hero bore,\nVeil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore;\nThere bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd\nHis manly members in the immortal vest;\nAnd with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews\nRestores his freshness, and his form renews.\nThen Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,\nOf matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,\nReceived Sarpedon, at the god's command,\nAnd in a moment reach'd the Lycian land;\nThe corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,\nWhere endless honours wait the sacred shade.\nMeanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,\nWith foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins.\nFierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,\nAh blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew:\nAgainst what fate and powerful Jove ordain,\nVain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain.\nFor he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd\nDismay the mighty, and confound the bold;\nThe god who gives, resumes, and orders all,\nHe urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.\nWho first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,\nWho last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain;\nWhen heaven itself thy fatal fury led,\nAnd call'd to fill the number of the dead?\nAdrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;\nEcheclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,\nEpistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;\nThe slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown'd:\nThen sunk Pylartes to eternal night;\nThe rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.\nNow Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,\nBut flaming Ph\u0153bus kept the sacred tower.\nThrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;[246]\nHis blazing \u00e6gis thrice Apollo shook;\nHe tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,\nA more than mortal voice was heard aloud.\n\"Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall\nDefies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;\nThy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,\nTroy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand.\"\nSo spoke the god who darts celestial fires;\nThe Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.\nWhile Hector, checking at the Sc\u00e6an gates\nHis panting coursers, in his breast debates,\nOr in the field his forces to employ,\nOr draw the troops within the walls of Troy.\nThus while he thought, beside him Ph\u0153bus stood,\nIn Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;\n(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,\nA valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)\nThus he accosts him. \"What a shameful sight!\nGod! is it Hector that forbears the fight?\nWere thine my vigour this successful spear\nShould soon convince thee of so false a fear.\nTurn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,\nAnd in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.\nPerhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,\nAnd heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed.\"\nSo spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,\nAnd plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.\nHe bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;\nThe lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.\nThe god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,\nAnd pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.\nPatroclus lights, impatient for the fight;\nA spear his left, a stone employs his right:\nWith all his nerves he drives it at the foe.\nPointed above, and rough and gross below:\nThe falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,\nThe lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;\nHis front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:\nThe bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.\nThe charioteer, while yet he held the rein,\nStruck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.\nTo the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,\nWhile the proud victor thus his fall derides.\n\"Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!\nWhat skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!\nMark with what ease they sink into the sand!\nPity that all their practice is by land!\"\nThen rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,\nTo spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:\nSwift as a lion, terrible and bold,\nThat sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;\nPierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,\nAnd from his fatal courage finds his bane.\nAt once bold Hector leaping from his car,\nDefends the body, and provokes the war.\nThus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,\nTwo lordly rulers of the wood engage;\nStung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,\nAnd echoing roars rebellow through the shades.\nStern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,\nAnd by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:\nWhile all around, confusion, rage, and fright,\nMix the contending hosts in mortal fight.\nSo pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud\nIn the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;\nLeaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,\nThe broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;\nThis way and that, the rattling thicket bends,\nAnd the whole forest in one crash descends.\nNot with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,\nIn dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.\nDarts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;\nNow flights of arrows bounding from the string:\nStones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,\nSome hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.\nBut where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,\nSunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,\nAnd, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!\nNow flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven\nHis fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;\nWhile on each host with equal tempests fell\nThe showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.\nBut when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,\nGlad conquest rested on the Grecian train.\nThen from amidst the tumult and alarms,\nThey draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.\nThen rash Patroclus with new fury glows,\nAnd breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.\nThrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,\nAnd thrice three heroes at each onset slew.\nThere ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine\nThe last, black remnant of so bright a line:\nApollo dreadful stops thy middle way;\nDeath calls, and heaven allows no longer day!\nFor lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,\nApproaching dealt a staggering blow behind.\nThe weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;\nHis eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel\nIn giddy darkness; far to distance flung,\nHis bounding helmet on the champaign rung.\nAchilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;\nThat plume which never stoop'd to earth before;\nLong used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,\nAnd shade the temples of the mad divine.\nJove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;\nNot long\u2014for fate pursues him, and the god.\nHis spear in shivers falls; his ample shield\nDrops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:\nThe corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:\nLoose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;\nStupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:\nSuch is the force of more than mortal hands!\nA Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,\nFrom Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;\nFamed for the manage of the foaming horse,\nSkill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:\nFull twenty knights he tumbled from the car,\nWhile yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.\nHis venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;\nHe struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.\nNor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:\nBut swift withdrew the long-protended wood.\nAnd turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.\nThus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,\nWounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,\nRetires for succour to his social train,\nAnd flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.\nStern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,\nBreaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:\nThe lance arrests him with a mortal wound;\nHe falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.\nWith him all Greece was sunk; that moment all\nHer yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.\nSo, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,\nThe roaming lion meets a bristly boar,\nFast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,\nWith flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;\nAt length the sovereign savage wins the strife;\nAnd the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.\nPatroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,\nSo many lives effused, expires his own.",

The raging pair\nPierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.\nAlready had stern Hector seized his head,\nAnd doom'd to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;\nBut soon as Ajax rear'd his tower-like shield,\nSprung to his car, and measured back the field,\nHis train to Troy the radiant armour bear,\nTo stand a trophy of his fame in war.\nMeanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display'd)\nGuards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;\nAnd now before, and now behind he stood:\nThus in the centre of some gloomy wood,\nWith many a step, the lioness surrounds\nHer tawny young, beset by men and hounds;\nElate her heart, and rousing all her powers,\nDark o'er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.\nFast by his side the generous Spartan glows\nWith great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.\nBut Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,\nOn Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:\n\"Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?\nA manly form, without a manly mind.\nIs this, O chief! a hero's boasted fame?\nHow vain, without the merit, is the name!\nSince battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ\nWhat other methods may preserve thy Troy:\n'Tis time to try if Ilion's state can stand\nBy thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:\nMean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake\nTheir lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?\nWhat from thy thankless arms can we expect?\nThy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;\nSay, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,\nWhile unreveng'd the great Sarpedon falls?\nEven where he died for Troy, you left him there,\nA feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.\nOn my command if any Lycian wait,\nHence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.\nDid such a spirit as the gods impart\nImpel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,\n(Such as should burn in every soul that draws\nThe sword for glory, and his country's cause)\nEven yet our mutual arms we might employ,\nAnd drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.\nOh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain\nSarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again!\nGreece with Achilles' friend should be repaid,\nAnd thus due honours purchased to his shade.\nBut words are vain\u2014Let Ajax once appear,\nAnd Hector trembles and recedes with fear;\nThou dar'st not meet the terrors of his eye;\nAnd lo! already thou prepar'st to fly.\"",

Along their face\nThe big round drops coursed down with silent pace,\nConglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late\nCircled their arched necks, and waved in state,\nTrail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,\nAnd prone to earth was hung their languid head:\nNor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,\nWhile thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:\n\"Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,\nExempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;\nDid we your race on mortal man bestow,\nOnly, alas! to share in mortal woe?\nFor ah! what is there of inferior birth,\nThat breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;\nWhat wretched creature of what wretched kind,\nThan man more weak, calamitous, and blind?\nA miserable race! but cease to mourn:\nFor not by you shall Priam's son be borne\nHigh on the splendid car: one glorious prize\nHe rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.\nOurself will swiftness to your nerves impart,\nOurself with rising spirits swell your heart.\nAutomedon your rapid flight shall bear\nSafe to the navy through the storm of war.\nFor yet 'tis given to Troy to ravage o'er\nThe field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;\nThe sun shall see her conquer, till his fall\nWith sacred darkness shades the face of all.\"\nHe said; and breathing in the immortal horse\nExcessive spirit, urged them to the course;\nFrom their high manes they shake the dust, and bear\nThe kindling chariot through the parted war:\nSo flies a vulture through the clamorous train\nOf geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.\nFrom danger now with swiftest speed they flew,\nAnd now to conquest with like speed pursue;\nSole in the seat the charioteer remains,\nNow plies the javelin, now directs the reins:\nHim brave Alcimedon beheld distress'd,\nApproach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd:\n\"What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,\nAlone, unaided, in the thickest war?\nAlas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields\nAchilles' arms triumphant in the fields.\"\n\"In happy time (the charioteer replies)\nThe bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;\nNo Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,\nOr holds their fury in suspended reins:\nPatroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,\nBut now Patroclus is an empty name!\nTo thee I yield the seat, to thee resign\nThe ruling charge: the task of fight be mine.\"\nHe said. Alcimedon, with active heat,\nSnatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.\nHis friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,\nAnd call'd \u00c6neas fighting near his side.\n\"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,\nAchilles' car, deserted of its lord!\nThe glorious steeds our ready arms invite,\nScarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.\nCan such opponents stand when we assail?\nUnite thy force, my friend, and we prevail.\"\nThe son of Venus to the counsel yields;\nThen o'er their backs they spread their solid shields:\nWith brass refulgent the broad surface shined,\nAnd thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.\nThem Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;\nEach hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:\nIn vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,\nIn vain advance! not fated to return.\nUnmov'd, Automedon attends the fight,\nImplores the Eternal, and collects his might.\nThen turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:\n\"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!\nFull on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,\nFor hard the fight, determined is the foe;\n'Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,\nWar knows no mean; he wins it or he dies.\"\nThen through the field he sends his voice aloud,\nAnd calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,\nWith great Atrides. \"Hither turn, (he said,)\nTurn where distress demands immediate aid;\nThe dead, encircled by his friends, forego,\nAnd save the living from a fiercer foe.\nUnhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage\nThe force of Hector, and \u00c6neas' rage:\nYet mighty as they are, my force to prove\nIs only mine: the event belongs to Jove.\"\nHe spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,\nWhich pass'd the shield of Aretus the young:\nIt pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,\nThen in the lower belly struck the dart.\nAs when a ponderous axe, descending full,\nCleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:[249]\nStruck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,\nThen tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:\nThus fell the youth; the air his soul received,\nAnd the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.\nNow at Automedon the Trojan foe\nDischarged his lance; the meditated blow,\nStooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,\nAnd hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;\nDeep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear\nIn long vibrations spent its fury there.\nWith clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,\nBut each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;\nNor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,\nBut left their slain companion in his blood:\nHis arms Automedon divests, and cries,\n\"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:\nThus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,\nPoor as it is, some offering to thy shade.\"\nSo looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,\nAll grim with rage, and horrible with gore;\nHigh on the chariot at one bound he sprung,\nAnd o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.\nAnd now Minerva from the realms of air\nDescends impetuous, and renews the war;\nFor, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,\nThe lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.\nAs when high Jove denouncing future woe,\nO'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,\n(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,\nOr from the rage of man, destructive war,)\nThe drooping cattle dread the impending skies,\nAnd from his half-till'd field the labourer flies:\nIn such a form the goddess round her drew\nA livid cloud, and to the battle flew.\nAssuming Ph\u0153nix' shape on earth she falls,\nAnd in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:\n\"And lies Achilles' friend, beloved by all,\nA prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?\nWhat shame 'o Greece for future times to tell,\nTo thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!\"\n\"O chief, O father! (Atreus' son replies)\nO full of days! by long experience wise!\nWhat more desires my soul, than here unmoved\nTo guard the body of the man I loved?\nAh, would Minerva send me strength to rear\nThis wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!\nBut Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,\nAnd Jove's own glories blaze around his head!\"\nPleased to be first of all the powers address'd,\nShe breathes new vigour in her hero's breast,\nAnd fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,\nDesire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.\nSo burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o'er),\nRepulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;\n(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings\nUntamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.\nFired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,\nAnd sent his soul with every lance he threw.\nThere stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,\nA\u00ebtion's son, and Podes was his name:\nWith riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd,\nBy Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;\nThrough his broad belt the spear a passage found,\nAnd, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.\nSudden at Hector's side Apollo stood,\nLike Phaenops, Asius' son, appear'd the god;\n(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign\nIn fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)\n\"Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!\nWhat Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?\nDost thou at length to Menelaus yield,\nA chief once thought no terror of the field?\nYet singly, now, the long-disputed prize\nHe bears victorious, while our army flies:\nBy the same arm illustrious Podes bled;\nThe friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!\"\nThis heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,\nRage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.\nBut now the Eternal shook his sable shield,\nThat shaded Ide and all the subject field\nBeneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud\nInvolved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud;\nThe affrighted hills from their foundations nod,\nAnd blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:\nAt one regard of his all-seeing eye\nThe vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.\nThen trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;\nFor as the brave B\u0153otian turn'd his head\nTo face the foe, Polydamas drew near,\nAnd razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear:\nBy Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,\nPierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,\nGrasps his once formidable lance in vain.\nAs Hector follow'd, Idomen address'd\nThe flaming javelin to his manly breast;\nThe brittle point before his corslet yields;\nExulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:\nHigh on his chariots the Cretan stood,\nThe son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.\nBut erring from its aim, the impetuous spear\nStruck to the dust the squire and charioteer\nOf martial Merion: Coeranus his name,\nWho left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.\nOn foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,\nHad graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,\nBut the brave squire the ready coursers brought,\nAnd with his life his master's safety bought.\nBetween his cheek and ear the weapon went,\nThe teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.\nProne from the seat he tumbles to the plain;\nHis dying hand forgets the falling rein:\nThis Merion reaches, bending from the car,\nAnd urges to desert the hopeless war:\nIdomeneus consents; the lash applies;\nAnd the swift chariot to the navy flies.\nNot Ajax less the will of heaven descried,\nAnd conquest shifting to the Trojan side,\nTurn'd by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,\nTo Atreus's seed, the godlike Telamon:\n\"Alas! who sees not Jove's almighty hand\nTransfers the glory to the Trojan band?\nWhether the weak or strong discharge the dart,\nHe guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:\nNot so our spears; incessant though they rain,\nHe suffers every lance to fall in vain.\nDeserted of the god, yet let us try\nWhat human strength and prudence can supply;\nIf yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,\nMay glad the fleets that hope not our return,\nWho tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,\nAnd still hear Hector thundering at their gates.\nSome hero too must be despatch'd to bear\nThe mournful message to Pelides' ear;\nFor sure he knows not, distant on the shore,\nHis friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.\nBut such a chief I spy not through the host:\nThe men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost\nIn general darkness\u2014Lord of earth and air!\nOh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:\nDispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;\nGive me to see, and Ajax asks no more:\nIf Greece must perish, we thy will obey,\nBut let us perish in the face of day!\"\nWith tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer\nThe god relenting clear'd the clouded air;\nForth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;\nThe blaze of armour flash'd against the day.\n\"Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;\nIf yet Antilochus survives the fight,\nLet him to great Achilles' ear convey\nThe fatal news\"\u2014Atrides hastes away.\nSo turns the lion from the nightly fold,\nThough high in courage, and with hunger bold,\nLong gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,\nStiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;\nThe darts fly round him from a hundred hands,\nAnd the red terrors of the blazing brands:\nTill late, reluctant, at the dawn of day\nSour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,\nSo moved Atrides from his dangerous place\nWith weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;\nThe foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain,\nAnd much admonish'd, much adjured his train:\n\"O guard these relics to your charge consign'd,\nAnd bear the merits of the dead in mind;\nHow skill'd he was in each obliging art;\nThe mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:\nHe was, alas! but fate decreed his end,\nIn death a hero, as in life a friend!\"\nSo parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,\nAnd round on all sides sent his piercing view.\nAs the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye\nOf all that wings the mid a\u00ebrial sky,\nThe sacred eagle, from his walks above\nLooks down, and sees the distant thicket move;\nThen stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,\nSnatches his life amid the clouds of air.\nNot with less quickness, his exerted sight\nPass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight:\nTill on the left the chief he sought, he found,\nCheering his men, and spreading deaths around:\nTo him the king: \"Beloved of Jove! draw near,\nFor sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear;\nThy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn!\nHow Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.\nThis is not all: Patroclus, on the shore\nNow pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.\nFly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell\nThe sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:\nHe too may haste the naked corse to gain:\nThe arms are Hector's, who despoil'd the slain.\"\nThe youthful warrior heard with silent woe,\nFrom his fair eyes the tears began to flow:\nBig with the mighty grief, he strove to say\nWhat sorrow dictates, but no word found way.\nTo brave Laodocus his arms he flung,\nWho, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;\nThen ran the mournful message to impart,\nWith tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.\nSwift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands\n(Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands;\nBut bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;\nHimself returns to his Patroclus slain.\n\"Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);\nBut hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid:\nThough fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,\nUnarm'd, he fights not with the Trojan foe.\n'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,\n'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,\nAnd save ourselves, while with impetuous hate\nTroy pours along, and this way rolls our fate.\"\n\"'Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,\nWith Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear;\nMyself, and my bold brother will sustain\nThe shock of Hector and his charging train:\nNor fear we armies, fighting side by side;\nWhat Troy can dare, we have already tried,\nHave tried it, and have stood.\" The hero said.\nHigh from the ground the warriors heave the dead.\nA general clamour rises at the sight:\nLoud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.\nNot fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,\nWith rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,\nVoracious hounds, that many a length before\nTheir furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;\nBut if the savage turns his glaring eye,\nThey howl aloof, and round the forest fly.\nThus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,\nWave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:\nBut Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,\nAll pale they tremble and forsake the field.\nWhile thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,\nBehind them rages all the storm of war:\nConfusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng\nOf men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:\nLess fierce the winds with rising flames conspire\nTo whelm some city under waves of fire;\nNow sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,\nNow crack the blazing temples of the gods;\nThe rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,\nAnd sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.\nThe heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load:\nAs when two mules, along the rugged road,\nFrom the steep mountain with exerted strength\nDrag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length;\nInly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,\nThe enormous timber lumbering down the hill:\nSo these\u2014Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,\nAnd breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.\nThus when a river swell'd with sudden rains\nSpreads his broad waters o'er the level plains,\nSome interposing hill the stream divides,\nAnd breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.\nStill close they follow, close the rear engage;\n\u00c6neas storms, and Hector foams with rage:\nWhile Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,\nWedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,\nThat shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung\nHigh on poised pinions, threats their callow young.\nSo from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,\nSuch the wild terror, and the mingled cry:\nWithin, without the trench, and all the way,\nStrow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;\nSuch horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds\nThe work of death, and still the battle bleeds.\n[Illustration: ] VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM",

I shall stop his flight.\nTo better counsel then attention lend;\nTake due refreshment, and the watch attend.\nIf there be one whose riches cost him care,\nForth let him bring them for the troops to share;\n'Tis better generously bestow'd on those,\nThan left the plunder of our country's foes.\nSoon as the morn the purple orient warms,\nFierce on yon navy will we pour our arms.\nIf great Achilles rise in all his might,\nHis be the danger: I shall stand the fight.\nHonour, ye gods! or let me gain or give;\nAnd live he glorious, whosoe'er shall live!\nMars is our common lord, alike to all;\nAnd oft the victor triumphs, but to fall.\"",

another dragg'd a dead;\nNow here, now there, the carcases they tore:\nFate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.\nAnd the whole war came out, and met the eye;\nAnd each bold figure seem'd to live or die.\nA field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,[256]\nThe third time labour'd by the sweating hind;\nThe shining shares full many ploughmen guide,\nAnd turn their crooked yokes on every side.\nStill as at either end they wheel around,\nThe master meets them with his goblet crown'd;\nThe hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,\nThen back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:\nBehind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;\nAnd sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.\nAnother field rose high with waving grain;\nWith bended sickles stand the reaper train:\nHere stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,\nSheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.\nWith sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;\nThe gatherers follow, and collect in bands;\nAnd last the children, in whose arms are borne\n(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.\nThe rustic monarch of the field descries,\nWith silent glee, the heaps around him rise.\nA ready banquet on the turf is laid,\nBeneath an ample oak's expanded shade.\nThe victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;\nThe reaper's due repast, the woman's care.\nNext, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,\nBent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;\nA deeper dye the dangling clusters show,\nAnd curl'd on silver props, in order glow:\nA darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;\nAnd pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.\nTo this, one pathway gently winding leads,\nWhere march a train with baskets on their heads,\n(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear\nThe purple product of the autumnal year.\nTo these a youth awakes the warbling strings,\nWhose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;\nIn measured dance behind him move the train,\nTune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.\nHere herds of oxen march, erect and bold,\nRear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,\nAnd speed to meadows on whose sounding shores\nA rapid torrent through the rushes roars:\nFour golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,\nAnd nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.\nTwo lions rushing from the wood appear'd;\nAnd seized a bull, the master of the herd:\nHe roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;\nThey tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.\nThe dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,\nDread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.\nNext this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads\nDeep through fair forests, and a length of meads,\nAnd stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;\nAnd fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.\nA figured dance succeeds; such once was seen\nIn lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,\nForm'd by Daedalean art; a comely band\nOf youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.\nThe maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;\nThe youths all graceful in the glossy vest:\nOf those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;\nOf these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,\nThat glittering gay, from silver belts depend.\nNow all at once they rise, at once descend,\nWith well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,\nConfusedly regular, the moving maze:\nNow forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,\nAnd undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:\nSo whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,\nAnd, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.\nThe gazing multitudes admire around:\nTwo active tumblers in the centre bound;\nNow high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:\nAnd general songs the sprightly revel end.\nThus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd\nWith his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:\nIn living silver seem'd the waves to roll,\nAnd beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.\nThis done, whate'er a warrior's use requires\nHe forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,\nThe greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd\nWith various sculpture, and the golden crest.\nAt Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:\nShe, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,\nSwift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,",

appeased, propitious to our prayer,\nResume thy arms, and shine again in war.\"\n\"O king of nations! whose superior sway\n(Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey!\nTo keep or send the presents, be thy care;\nTo us, 'tis equal: all we ask is war.\nWhile yet we talk, or but an instant shun\nThe fight, our glorious work remains undone.\nLet every Greek, who sees my spear confound\nThe Trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,\nWith emulation, what I act survey,\nAnd learn from thence the business of the day.\"\nThe son of Peleus thus; and thus replies\nThe great in councils, Ithacus the wise:\n\"Though, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress'd,\nAt least our armies claim repast and rest:\nLong and laborious must the combat be,\nWhen by the gods inspired, and led by thee.\nStrength is derived from spirits and from blood,\nAnd those augment by generous wine and food:\nWhat boastful son of war, without that stay,\nCan last a hero through a single day?\nCourage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,\nMere unsupported man must yield at length;\nShrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,\nThe drooping body will desert the mind:\nBut built anew with strength-conferring fare,\nWith limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.\nDismiss the people, then, and give command,\nWith strong repast to hearten every band;\nBut let the presents to Achilles made,\nIn full assembly of all Greece be laid.\nThe king of men shall rise in public sight,\nAnd solemn swear (observant of the rite)\nThat, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,\nPure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.\nThat done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,\nAnd the full price of injured honour paid.\nStretch not henceforth, O prince! thy sovereign might\nBeyond the bounds of reason and of right;\n'Tis the chief praise that e'er to kings belong'd,\nTo right with justice whom with power they wrong'd.\"\nTo him the monarch: \"Just is thy decree,\nThy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.\nEach due atonement gladly I prepare;\nAnd heaven regard me as I justly swear!\nHere then awhile let Greece assembled stay,\nNor great Achilles grudge this short delay.\nTill from the fleet our presents be convey'd,\nAnd Jove attesting, the firm compact made.\nA train of noble youths the charge shall bear;\nThese to select, Ulysses, be thy care:\nIn order rank'd let all our gifts appear,\nAnd the fair train of captives close the rear:\nTalthybius shall the victim boar convey,\nSacred to Jove, and yon bright orb of day.\"\n\"For this (the stern \u00c6acides replies)\nSome less important season may suffice,\nWhen the stern fury of the war is o'er,\nAnd wrath, extinguish'd, burns my breast no more.\nBy Hector slain, their faces to the sky,\nAll grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie:\nThose call to war! and might my voice incite,\nNow, now, this instant, shall commence the fight:\nThen, when the day's complete, let generous bowls,\nAnd copious banquets, glad your weary souls.\nLet not my palate know the taste of food,\nTill my insatiate rage be cloy'd with blood:\nPale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o'er,\nAnd his cold feet are pointed to the door.\nRevenge is all my soul! no meaner care,\nInterest, or thought, has room to harbour there;\nDestruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,\nAnd scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds.\"\n\"O first of Greeks, (Ulysses thus rejoin'd,)\nThe best and bravest of the warrior kind!\nThy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,\nBut old experience and calm wisdom mine.\nThen hear my counsel, and to reason yield,\nThe bravest soon are satiate of the field;\nThough vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,\nThe bloody harvest brings but little gain:\nThe scale of conquest ever wavering lies,\nGreat Jove but turns it, and the victor dies!\nThe great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,\nAnd endless were the grief, to weep for all.\nEternal sorrows what avails to shed?\nGreece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:\nEnough, when death demands the brave, to pay\nThe tribute of a melancholy day.\nOne chief with patience to the grave resign'd,\nOur care devolves on others left behind.\nLet generous food supplies of strength produce,\nLet rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,\nLet their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,\nAnd pour new furies on the feebler foe.\nYet a short interval, and none shall dare\nExpect a second summons to the war;\nWho waits for that, the dire effects shall find,\nIf trembling in the ships he lags behind.\nEmbodied, to the battle let us bend,\nAnd all at once on haughty Troy descend.\"\nAnd now the delegates Ulysses sent,\nTo bear the presents from the royal tent:\nThe sons of Nestor, Phyleus' valiant heir,\nThias and Merion, thunderbolts of war,\nWith Lycomedes of Creiontian strain,\nAnd Melanippus, form'd the chosen train.\nSwift as the word was given, the youths obey'd:\nTwice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;\nA row of six fair tripods then succeeds;\nAnd twice the number of high-bounding steeds:\nSeven captives next a lovely line compose;\nThe eighth Brise\u00efs, like the blooming rose,\nClosed the bright band: great Ithacus, before,\nFirst of the train, the golden talents bore:\nThe rest in public view the chiefs dispose,\nA splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose:\nThe boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord\nDrew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword:\nThe stubborn bristles from the victim's brow\nHe crops, and offering meditates his vow.\nHis hands uplifted to the attesting skies,\nOn heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.\nThe solemn words a deep attention draw,\nAnd Greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.\n\"Witness thou first! thou greatest power above,\nAll-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!\nAnd mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,\nAnd ye, fell furies of the realms of night,\nWho rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare\nFor perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!\nThe black-eyed maid inviolate removes,\nPure and unconscious of my manly loves.\nIf this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,\nAnd levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!\"\nWith that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;\nThe bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;\nThe sacred herald rolls the victim slain\n(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.\nThen thus Achilles: \"Hear, ye Greeks! and know\nWhate'er we feel, 'tis Jove inflicts the woe;\nNot else Atrides could our rage inflame,\nNor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.\n'Twas Jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,\nThat doom'd our strife, and doom'd the Greeks to fall.\nGo then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;\nAchilles waits ye, and expects the fight.\"\nThe speedy council at his word adjourn'd:\nTo their black vessels all the Greeks return'd.",

Such the lion's rage,\nWho viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,\nThough all in arms the peopled city rise,\nStalks careless on, with unregarding pride;\nTill at the length, by some brave youth defied,\nTo his bold spear the savage turns alone,\nHe murmurs fury with a hollow groan;\nHe grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around,\nLash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;\nHe calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,\nResolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.\nSo fierce Achilles on \u00c6neas flies;\nSo stands \u00c6neas, and his force defies.\nEre yet the stern encounter join'd, begun\nThe seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:\n\"Why comes \u00c6neas through the ranks so far?\nSeeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,\nIn hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,\nAnd prove his merits to the throne of Troy?\nGrant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,\nThe partial monarch may refuse the prize;\nSons he has many; those thy pride may quell:\nAnd 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,\nOr, in reward of thy victorious hand,\nHas Troy proposed some spacious tract of land,\nAn ample forest, or a fair domain,\nOf hills for vines, and arable for grain?\nEven this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.\nBut can Achilles be so soon forgot?\nOnce (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear,\nAnd then the great \u00c6neas seem'd to fear:\nWith hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,\nNor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.\nHer lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;\nThose, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:\nIn Grecian chains her captive race were cast;\n'Tis true, the great \u00c6neas fled too fast.\nDefrauded of my conquest once before,\nWhat then I lost, the gods this day restore.\nGo; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\"\nTo this Anchises' son: \"Such words employ\nTo one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;\nSuch we disdain; the best may be defied\nWith mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;\nUnworthy the high race from which we came\nProclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame:\nEach from illustrious fathers draws his line;\nEach goddess-born; half human, half divine.\nThetis' this day, or Venus' offspring dies,\nAnd tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:\nFor when two heroes, thus derived, contend,\n'Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.\nIf yet thou further seek to learn my birth\n(A tale resounded through the spacious earth)\nHear how the glorious origin we prove\nFrom ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:\nDardania's walls he raised; for Ilion, then,\n(The city since of many-languaged men,)\nWas not. The natives were content to till\nThe shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.[264]\nFrom Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,\nThe richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;\nThree thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,\nThree thousand foals beside their mothers fed.\nBoreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,\nConceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,\nWith voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,\nAnd coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:\nHence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,\nSwift as their mother mares, and father wind.\nThese lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,\nNor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;\nAnd when along the level seas they flew,[265]\nScarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.\nSuch Erichthonius was: from him there came\nThe sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.\nThree sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,\nIlus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:\nThe matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,\nWhom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,\nTo bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,\nThe grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).\nThe two remaining sons the line divide:\nFirst rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;\nFrom him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,\nAnd Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;\nClytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;\nAnd Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.\nFrom great Assaracus sprang Capys, he\nBegat Anchises, and Anchises me.\nSuch is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,\nBut Jove alone endues the soul with worth:\nHe, source of power and might! with boundless sway,\nAll human courage gives, or takes away.\nLong in the field of words we may contend,\nReproach is infinite, and knows no end,\nArm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;\nSo voluble a weapon is the tongue;\nWounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,\nFor every man has equal strength to rail:\nWomen alone, when in the streets they jar,\nPerhaps excel us in this wordy war;\nLike us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,\nAnd vent their anger impotent and loud.\nCease then\u2014Our business in the field of fight\nIs not to question, but to prove our might.\nTo all those insults thou hast offer'd here,\nReceive this answer: 'tis my flying spear.\"\nHe spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,\nFix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.\nFar on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held\n(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,\nThat trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear\nSaw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.\nHis fears were vain; impenetrable charms\nSecured the temper of the ethereal arms.\nThrough two strong plates the point its passage held,\nBut stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.\nFive plates of various metal, various mould,\nComposed the shield; of brass each outward fold,\nOf tin each inward, and the middle gold:\nThere stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,\nThe forceful spear of great Achilles flew,\nAnd pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,\nWhere the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:\nThrough the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,\nAnd the slight covering of expanded hides.\n\u00c6neas his contracted body bends,\nAnd o'er him high the riven targe extends,\nSees, through its parting plates, the upper air,\nAnd at his back perceives the quivering spear:\nA fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;\nAnd swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.\nAchilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,\nDraws his broad blade, and at \u00c6neas flies:\n\u00c6neas rousing as the foe came on,\nWith force collected, heaves a mighty stone:\nA mass enormous! which in modern days\nNo two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.\nBut ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground\nSaw the distress, and moved the powers around:\n\"Lo! on the brink of fate \u00c6neas stands,\nAn instant victim to Achilles' hands;\nBy Ph\u0153bus urged; but Ph\u0153bus has bestow'd\nHis aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.\nAnd can ye see this righteous chief atone\nWith guiltless blood for vices not his own?\nTo all the gods his constant vows were paid;\nSure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.\nFate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign\nThe future father of the Dardan line:[266]\nThe first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,\nAnd still his love descends on all the race:\nFor Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,\nAt length are odious to the all-seeing mind;\nOn great \u00c6neas shall devolve the reign,\nAnd sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.\"\nThe great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies\nThe imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:\n\"Good as he is, to immolate or spare\nThe Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;\nPallas and I, by all that gods can bind,\nHave sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;\nNot even an instant to protract their fate,\nOr save one member of the sinking state;\nTill her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,\nAnd even her crumbling ruins are no more.\"\nThe king of ocean to the fight descends,\nThrough all the whistling darts his course he bends,\nSwift interposed between the warrior flies,\nAnd casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.[267]\nFrom great \u00c6neas' shield the spear he drew,\nAnd at his master's feet the weapon threw.\nThat done, with force divine he snatch'd on high\nThe Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,\nSmooth-gliding without step, above the heads\nOf warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:\nTill at the battle's utmost verge they light,\nWhere the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.\nThe godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)\nWith words like these the panting chief address'd:\n\"What power, O prince! with force inferior far,\nUrged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?\nHenceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,\nDefrauding fate of all thy fame to come.\nBut when the day decreed (for come it must)\nShall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,\nLet then the furies of that arm be known,\nSecure no Grecian force transcends thy own.\"",

On the border stood\nA spreading elm, that overhung the flood;\nHe seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;\nThe plant uprooted to his weight gave way.[270]\nHeaving the bank, and undermining all;\nLoud flash the waters to the rushing fall\nOf the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd\nBridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd\nOn this his weight, and raised upon his hand,\nLeap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.\nThen blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:\nThe god pursues, a huger billow throws,\nAnd bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy\nThe man whose fury is the fate of Troy.\nHe like the warlike eagle speeds his pace\n(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);\nFar as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;\nAt every bound his clanging armour rings:\nNow here, now there, he turns on every side,\nAnd winds his course before the following tide;\nThe waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,\nAnd gather fast, and murmur at his heels.\nSo when a peasant to his garden brings\nSoft rills of water from the bubbling springs,\nAnd calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,\nAnd feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:\nSoon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,\nAnd marks the future current with his spade,\nSwift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,\nLouder and louder purl the falling rills;\nBefore him scattering, they prevent his pains,\nAnd shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.\nStill flies Achilles, but before his eyes\nStill swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:\nNot all his speed escapes the rapid floods;\nThe first of men, but not a match for gods.\nOft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,\nAnd bravely try if all the powers were foes;\nSo oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,\nBeats on his back, or bursts upon his head.\nYet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,\nAnd still indignant bounds above the waves.\nTired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;\nWash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;\nWhen thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)\nForth bursts the hero with an angry groan:\n\"Is there no god Achilles to befriend,\nNo power to avert his miserable end?\nPrevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,[271]\nAnd make my future life the sport of fate.\nOf all heaven's oracles believed in vain,\nBut most of Thetis must her son complain;\nBy Ph\u0153bus' darts she prophesied my fall,\nIn glorious arms before the Trojan wall.\nOh! had I died in fields of battle warm,\nStretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!\nMight Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,\nAnd my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.\nAh no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,\nOh how unworthy of the brave and great!\nLike some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,\nCrossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,\nAn unregarded carcase to the sea.\"\nNeptune and Pallas haste to his relief,\nAnd thus in human form address'd the chief:\nThe power of ocean first: \"Forbear thy fear,\nO son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!\nBehold! from Jove descending to thy aid,\nPropitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.\nStay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave\n'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.\nBut thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!\nNor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,\nTill Troy receive her flying sons, till all\nHer routed squadrons pant behind their wall:\nHector alone shall stand his fatal chance,\nAnd Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.\nThine is the glory doom'd.\" Thus spake the gods:\nThen swift ascended to the bright abodes.\nStung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,\nHe springs impetuous, and invades the field:\nO'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;\nHeaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,\nFloating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold\nAnd turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.\nHigh o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,\nHe wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.\nNot a whole river stops the hero's course,\nWhile Pallas fills him with immortal force.\nWith equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,\nAnd lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.\nThen thus to Simois! \"Haste, my brother flood;\nAnd check this mortal that controls a god;\nOur bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,\nAnd Ilion tumble from her towery height.\nCall then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,\nFrom all thy fountains swell thy watery store,\nWith broken rocks, and with a load of dead,\nCharge the black surge, and pour it on his head.\nMark how resistless through the floods he goes,\nAnd boldly bids the warring gods be foes!\nBut nor that force, nor form divine to sight,\nShall aught avail him, if our rage unite:\nWhelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,\nThat blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;\nAnd deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,\nImmersed remain this terror of the world.\nSuch ponderous ruin shall confound the place,\nNo Greeks shall e'er his perish'd relics grace,\nNo hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;\nThese his cold rites, and this his watery tomb.\"\n[Illustration: ] ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS\nHe said; and on the chief descends amain,\nIncreased with gore, and swelling with the slain.\nThen, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,\nAnd a foam whitens on the purple waves:\nAt every step, before Achilles stood\nThe crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.\nFear touch'd the queen of heaven: she saw dismay'd,\nShe call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.\n\"Rise to the war! the insulting flood requires\nThy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!\nWhile to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,\nRush the swift eastern and the western wind:\nThese from old ocean at my word shall blow,\nPour the red torrent on the watery foe,\nCorses and arms to one bright ruin turn,\nAnd hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.\nGo, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,\nDrink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.\nScorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)\nExert the unwearied furies of the flame!\"\nThe power ignipotent her word obeys:\nWide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;\nAt once consumes the dead, and dries the soil\nAnd the shrunk waters in their channel boil.\nAs when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,\nAnd instant blows the water'd gardens dry:\nSo look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,\nWhile Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.\nSwift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;\nAlong the margin winds the running blaze:\nThe trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,\nThe flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,\nBroad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;\nThe watery willows hiss before the fire.\nNow glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,\nThe eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:\nNow flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,\nOr, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.\nAt length the river rear'd his languid head,\nAnd thus, short-panting, to the god he said:\n\"Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?\nI faint, I sink, unequal to the fight\u2014\nI yield\u2014Let Ilion fall; if fate decree\u2014\nAh\u2014bend no more thy fiery arms on me!\"\nHe ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;\nThe bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.\nAs when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,[272]\nTo melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,\nAmid the fierce embrace of circling fires\nThe waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:\nSo boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,\nAnd choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.\nTo Juno then, imperial queen of air,\nThe burning river sends his earnest prayer:\n\"Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage\nMe, only me, with all his wasteful rage?\nOn other gods his dreadful arm employ,\nFor mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.\nSubmissive I desist, if thou command;\nBut ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.\nHear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate\nUnaided Ilion, and her destined state,\nTill Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,\nAnd in one ruin sink the Trojan name.\"\nHis warm entreaty touch'd Saturnia's ear:\nShe bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,\nRecall the flame, nor in a mortal cause\nInfest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:\nAgain the branching streams begin to spread,\nAnd soft remurmur in their wonted bed.",

With feeble pace,\nAnd settled sorrow on his aged face,\nFast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;\nAnd thus descending, on the guards he calls:\n\"You to whose care our city-gates belong,\nSet wide your portals to the flying throng:\nFor lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;\nHe comes, and desolation marks his way!\nBut when within the walls our troops take breath,\nLock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.\"\nThus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung\nThe opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.\nPh\u0153bus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;\nStruck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,\nOn heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,\nAnd gladsome see their last escape from fate.\nThither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,\nHoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:\nAnd gasping, panting, fainting, labour on\nWith heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.\nEnraged Achilles follows with his spear;\nWild with revenge, insatiable of war.\nThen had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,\nAnd Troy inglorious to her walls retired;\nBut he, the god who darts ethereal flame,\nShot down to save her, and redeem her fame:\nTo young Agenor force divine he gave;\n(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)\nIn aid of him, beside the beech he sate,\nAnd wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.\nWhen now the generous youth Achilles spies,\nThick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.\n(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)\nHe stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;\n\"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!\nLike others fly, and be like others slain?\nVain hope! to shun him by the self-same road\nYon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.\nNo: with the common heap I scorn to fall\u2014\nWhat if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,\nWhile I decline to yonder path, that leads\nTo Ida's forests and surrounding shades?\nSo may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,\nFrom my tired body wash the dirt and blood,\nAs soon as night her dusky veil extends,\nReturn in safety to my Trojan friends.\nWhat if?\u2014But wherefore all this vain debate?\nStand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?\nEven now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,\nThe fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:\nSuch is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,\nAnd such his valour, that who stands must die.\nHowe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,\nHere, and in public view, to meet my fate.\nYet sure he too is mortal; he may feel\n(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.\nOne only soul informs that dreadful frame:\nAnd Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame.\"\nHe said, and stood, collected, in his might;\nAnd all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.\nSo from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,\nRoused from his thicket by a storm of darts:\nUntaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds\nOf shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;\nThough struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;\nAnd the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:\nOn their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;\nAnd tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.\nNot less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir\nConfronts Achilles, and awaits the war,\nDisdainful of retreat: high held before,\nHis shield (a broad circumference) he bore;\nThen graceful as he stood, in act to throw\nThe lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:\n\"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!\nAnd hopes this day to sink the Trojan name\nBeneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;\nA thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.\nParents and children our just arms employ,\nAnd strong and many are the sons of Troy.\nGreat as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore\nThese Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.\"\nHe said: with matchless force the javelin flung\nSmote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung\nBeneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms\nHe stands impassive in the ethereal arms.\nThen fiercely rushing on the daring foe,\nHis lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:\nBut, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds\nThe god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.\nSafe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,\nDismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.\nMeanwhile the god, to cover their escape,\nAssumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,\nFlies from the furious chief in this disguise;\nThe furious chief still follows where he flies.\nNow o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,\nNow urge the course where swift Scamander glides:\nThe god, now distant scarce a stride before,\nTempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;\nWhile all the flying troops their speed employ,\nAnd pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:\nNo stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,\nWho 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.\n'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;\nAnd sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.\nPale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:",

Fierce Minerva flies\nTo stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:\n\"O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,\nAnd conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.\nGreat Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,\nDrunk with renown, insatiable of war,\nFalls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,\nShall more avail him, nor his god of light.\nSee, where in vain he supplicates above,\nRoll'd at the feet of unrelenting Jove;\nRest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,\nAnd urge to meet the fate he cannot shun.\"\nHer voice divine the chief with joyful mind\nObey'd; and rested, on his lance reclined\nWhile like Deiphobus the martial dame\n(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),\nIn show an aid, by hapless Hector's side\nApproach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:\n\"Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight\nOf this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:\nIt fits us now a noble stand to make,\nAnd here, as brothers, equal fates partake.\"\nThen he: \"O prince! allied in blood and fame,\nDearer than all that own a brother's name;\nOf all that Hecuba to Priam bore,\nLong tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!\nSince you, of all our numerous race alone\nDefend my life, regardless of your own.\"\nAgain the goddess: \"Much my father's prayer,\nAnd much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:\nMy friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,\nBut stronger love impell'd, and I obey.\nCome then, the glorious conflict let us try,\nLet the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;\nOr let us stretch Achilles on the field,\nOr to his arm our bloody trophies yield.\"\nFraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:\nThe Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.\nSternly they met. The silence Hector broke:\nHis dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:\n\"Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd\nHer walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.\nBut now some god within me bids me try\nThine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.\nYet on the verge of battle let us stay,\nAnd for a moment's space suspend the day;\nLet Heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate\nThe just conditions of this stern debate,\n(Eternal witnesses of all below,\nAnd faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)\nTo them I swear; if, victor in the strife,\nJove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,\nNo vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;\nStripp'd of its arms alone (the conqueror's due)\nThe rest to Greece uninjured I'll restore:\nNow plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more.\"\n\"Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,\nWhile anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes),\nDetested as thou art, and ought to be,\nNor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:\nSuch pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,\nSuch leagues as men and furious lions join,\nTo such I call the gods! one constant state\nOf lasting rancour and eternal hate:\nNo thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,\nTill death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.\nRouse then thy forces this important hour,\nCollect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.\nNo further subterfuge, no further chance;\n'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.\nEach Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,\nNow hovers round, and calls thee to thy death.\"\nHe spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;\nBut Hector shunn'd the meditated blow:\nHe stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear\nSang innocent, and spent its force in air.",

train;\nThen clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;\nNext these the melancholy band appear;\nAmidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;\nO'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;\nAchilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,\nSupporting with his hands the hero's head,\nBends o'er the extended body of the dead.\nPatroclus decent on the appointed ground\nThey place, and heap the sylvan pile around.\nBut great Achilles stands apart in prayer,\nAnd from his head divides the yellow hair;\nThose curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,[287]\nAnd sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:\nThen sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,\nAnd roll'd his eyes around the watery waste:\n\"Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost\nDelightful roll along my native coast!\nTo whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,\nThese locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:\nFull fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,\nWhere to the day thy silver fountains rise,\nAnd where in shade of consecrated bowers\nThy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!\nSo vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain;\nNo more Achilles sees his native plain;\nIn that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,\nPatroclus bears them to the shades below.\"\nThus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd,\nOn his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.\nOnce more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:\nAnd now the sun had set upon their woe;\nBut to the king of men thus spoke the chief:\n\"Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:\nPermit the mourning legions to retire,\nAnd let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;\nThe pious care be ours, the dead to burn\u2014\"\nHe said: the people to their ships return:\nWhile those deputed to inter the slain\nHeap with a rising pyramid the plain.[288]\nA hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,\nThe growing structure spreads on every side;\nHigh on the top the manly corse they lay,\nAnd well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:\nAchilles covered with their fat the dead,\nAnd the piled victims round the body spread;\nThen jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,\nSuspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.\nFour sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan\nPour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.\nOf nine large dogs, domestic at his board,\nFall two, selected to attend their lord,\nThen last of all, and horrible to tell,\nSad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.[289]\nOn these the rage of fire victorious preys,\nInvolves and joins them in one common blaze.\nSmear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,\nAnd calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:[290]\n\"All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost\nHear, and exult, on Pluto's dreary coast.\nBehold Achilles' promise fully paid,\nTwelve Trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade;\nBut heavier fates on Hector's corse attend,\nSaved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend.\"\nSo spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain\nHis threat, and guard inviolate the slain:\nCelestial Venus hover'd o'er his head,\nAnd roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:\nShe watch'd him all the night and all the day,\nAnd drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.\nNor sacred Ph\u0153bus less employ'd his care;\nHe pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,\nAnd kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,\nAgainst the solar beam and Sirian fire.\n[Illustration: ] THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS\nNor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,\nSmokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;\nBut, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,\nInvoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,\nAnd victims promised, and libations cast,\nTo gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:\nHe call'd the aerial powers, along the skies\nTo breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.\nThe winged Iris heard the hero's call,\nAnd instant hasten'd to their airy hall,\nWhere in old Zephyr's open courts on high,\nSat all the blustering brethren of the sky.\nShe shone amidst them, on her painted bow;\nThe rocky pavement glitter'd with the show.\nAll from the banquet rise, and each invites\nThe various goddess to partake the rites.\n\"Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go\nTo sacred Ocean, and the floods below:\nEven now our solemn hecatombs attend,\nAnd heaven is feasting on the world's green end\nWith righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)\nFar on the extremest limits of the main.\nBut Peleus' son entreats, with sacrifice,\nThe western spirit, and the north, to rise!\nLet on Patroclus' pile your blast be driven,\nAnd bear the blazing honours high to heaven.\"\nSwift as the word she vanish'd from their view;\nSwift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;\nForth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,\nAnd heaps on heaps the clouds are toss'd before.\nTo the wide main then stooping from the skies,\nThe heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:\nTroy feels the blast along her shaking walls,\nTill on the pile the gather'd tempest falls.\nThe structure crackles in the roaring fires,\nAnd all the night the plenteous flame aspires.\nAll night Achilles hails Patroclus' soul,\nWith large libations from the golden bowl.\nAs a poor father, helpless and undone,\nMourns o'er the ashes of an only son,\nTakes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,\nAnd pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:\nSo stay'd Achilles, circling round the shore,\nSo watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.\n'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night,\nThe morning planet told the approach of light;\nAnd, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray\nO'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day:\nThen sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd,\nAnd to their caves the whistling winds return'd:\nAcross the Thracian seas their course they bore;\nThe ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.\nThen parting from the pile he ceased to weep,\nAnd sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,\nExhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd\nOf thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;\nThe tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook\nUnwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:\n\"Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!\nFirst let us quench the yet remaining flame\nWith sable wine; then, as the rites direct,\nThe hero's bones with careful view select:\n(Apart, and easy to be known they lie\nAmidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:\nThe rest around the margin will be seen\nPromiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)\nThese wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare;\nAnd in the golden vase dispose with care;\nThere let them rest with decent honour laid,\nTill I shall follow to the infernal shade.\nMeantime erect the tomb with pious hands,\nA common structure on the humble sands:\nHereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,\nAnd late posterity record our praise!\"\nThe Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,\nWide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw,\nAnd deep subsides the ashy heap below.\nNext the white bones his sad companions place,\nWith tears collected, in the golden vase.\nThe sacred relics to the tent they bore;\nThe urn a veil of linen covered o'er.\nThat done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,\nAnd cast the deep foundations round the pyre;\nHigh in the midst they heap the swelling bed\nOf rising earth, memorial of the dead.\nThe swarming populace the chief detains,\nAnd leads amidst a wide extent of plains;\nThere placed them round: then from the ships proceeds\nA train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,\nVases and tripods (for the funeral games),\nResplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.\nFirst stood the prizes to reward the force\nOf rapid racers in the dusty course:\nA woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,\nSkill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom;\nAnd a large vase, where two bright handles rise,\nOf twenty measures its capacious size.\nThe second victor claims a mare unbroke,\nBig with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:\nThe third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame;\nFour ample measures held the shining frame:\nTwo golden talents for the fourth were placed:\nAn ample double bowl contents the last.\nThese in fair order ranged upon the plain,\nThe hero, rising, thus address'd the train:\n\"Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed\nTo the brave rulers of the racing steed;\nPrizes which none beside ourself could gain,\nShould our immortal coursers take the plain;\n(A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god\nPeleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)\nBut this no time our vigour to display;\nNor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:\nLost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck\nTheir flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.\nSad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,\nAnd trail those graceful honours on the sand!\nLet others for the noble task prepare,\nWho trust the courser and the flying car.\"\nFired at his word the rival racers rise;",

At a stroke\nShe breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:\nNo more their way the startled horses held;\nThe car reversed came rattling on the field;\nShot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,\nProne on the dust the unhappy master fell;\nHis batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;\nNose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:\nGrief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:\nBefore him far the glad Tydides flies;\nMinerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,\nAnd crowns him victor of the labour'd race.\nThe next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;\nWhile thus young Nestor animates his steeds:\n\"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;\nNot that we hope to match Tydides' horse,\nSince great Minerva wings their rapid way,\nAnd gives their lord the honours of the day;\nBut reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo\nYour swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?\nThrough your neglect, if lagging on the plain\nThe last ignoble gift be all we gain,\nNo more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,\nThe old man's fury rises, and ye die.\nHaste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,\nPresents the occasion, could we use it right.\"\nThus he. The coursers at their master's threat\nWith quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.\nAnd now Antilochus with nice survey\nObserves the compass of the hollow way.\n'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,\nFast by the road a precipice was worn:\nHere, where but one could pass, to shun the throng\nThe Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.\nClose up the venturous youth resolves to keep,\nStill edging near, and bears him toward the steep.\nAtrides, trembling, casts his eye below,\nAnd wonders at the rashness of his foe.\n\"Hold, stay your steeds\u2014What madness thus to ride\nThis narrow way! take larger field (he cried),\nOr both must fall.\"\u2014Atrides cried in vain;\nHe flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.\nFar as an able arm the disk can send,\nWhen youthful rivals their full force extend,\nSo far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew\nBefore the king: he, cautious, backward drew\nHis horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears\nThe rattling ruin of the clashing cars,\nThe floundering coursers rolling on the plain,\nAnd conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.\nBut thus upbraids his rival as he flies:\n\"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!\nGo, but expect not I'll the prize resign;\nAdd perjury to fraud, and make it thine\u2014\"\nThen to his steeds with all his force he cries,\n\"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!\nYour rivals, destitute of youthful force,\nWith fainting knees shall labour in the course,\nAnd yield the glory yours.\"\u2014The steeds obey;\nAlready at their heels they wing their way,\nAnd seem already to retrieve the day.\nMeantime the Grecians in a ring beheld\nThe coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.\nThe first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;\nHigh on a rising ground, above the ring,\nThe monarch sat: from whence with sure survey\nHe well observed the chief who led the way,\nAnd heard from far his animating cries,\nAnd saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;\nOn whose broad front a blaze of shining white,\nLike the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.\nHe saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:\n\"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?\nOr can ye, all, another chief survey,\nAnd other steeds than lately led the way?\nThose, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,\nLie sure disabled in the middle field:\nFor, since the goal they doubled, round the plain\nI search to find them, but I search in vain.\nPerchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,\nAnd, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,\nShot from the chariot; while his coursers stray\nWith frantic fury from the destined way.\nRise then some other, and inform my sight,\nFor these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;\nYet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,\nThe great \u00c6tolian chief, renown'd in war.\"\n\"Old man! (O\u00efleus rashly thus replies)\nThy tongue too hastily confers the prize;\nOf those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,\nNor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.\nEumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,\nStill, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:\nI well discern him, as he shakes the rein,\nAnd hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain.\"\nThus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:\n\"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!\nContentious prince, of all the Greeks beside\nThe last in merit, as the first in pride!\nTo vile reproach what answer can we make?\nA goblet or a tripod let us stake,\nAnd be the king the judge. The most unwise\nWill learn their rashness, when they pay the price.\"\nHe said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,\nStern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn\nTo fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son\nAwful amidst them rose, and thus begun:\n\"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;\nMuch would ye blame, should others thus offend:\nAnd lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.\"\nNo sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,\nDrives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.\nHigh o'er his head the circling lash he wields:\nHis bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:\nHis car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,\nBright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,\nRefulgent through the cloud: no eye could find\nThe track his flying wheels had left behind:\nAnd the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace\nSo swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.\nNow victor at the goal Tydides stands,\nQuits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;\nFrom the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;\nThe well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:\nWith joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,\nThe tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:\nThese to the ships his train triumphant leads,\nThe chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.\nYoung Nestor follows (who by art, not force,\nO'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.\nBehind, Atrides urged the race, more near\nThan to the courser in his swift career\nThe following car, just touching with his heel\nAnd brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:\nSuch, and so narrow now the space between\nThe rivals, late so distant on the green;\nSo soon swift \u00c6the her lost ground regain'd,\nOne length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.\nMerion pursued, at greater distance still,",

Then let my foe\nDraw near, but first his certain fortune know;\nSecure this hand shall his whole frame confound,\nMash all his bones, and all his body pound:\nSo let his friends be nigh, a needful train,\nTo heave the batter'd carcase off the plain.\"\nThe giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze\nThe host beheld him, silent with amaze!\n'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire\nTo meet his might, and emulate thy sire,\nThe great Mecistheus; who in days of yore\nIn Theban games the noblest trophy bore,\n(The games ordain'd dead OEdipus to grace,)\nAnd singly vanquish the Cadmean race.\nHim great Tydides urges to contend,\nWarm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;\nOfficious with the cincture girds him round;\nAnd to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.\nAmid the circle now each champion stands,\nAnd poises high in air his iron hands;\nWith clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,\nTheir crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,\nAnd painful sweat from all their members flows.\nAt length Epeus dealt a weighty blow\nFull on the cheek of his unwary foe;\nBeneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway\nDown dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.\nAs a large fish, when winds and waters roar,\nBy some huge billow dash'd against the shore,\nLies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,\nThe bleeding hero pants upon the ground.\nTo rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,\nScornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;\nWhose arms support him, reeling through the throng,\nAnd dragging his disabled legs along;\nNodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er;\nHis mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;[292]\nWrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;\nHis friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.\nThe third bold game Achilles next demands,\nAnd calls the wrestlers to the level sands:\nA massy tripod for the victor lies,\nOf twice six oxen its reputed price;\nAnd next, the loser's spirits to restore,\nA female captive, valued but at four.\nScarce did the chief the vigorous strife propose\nWhen tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.\nAmid the ring each nervous rival stands,\nEmbracing rigid with implicit hands.\nClose lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:\nBelow, their planted feet at distance fix'd;\nLike two strong rafters which the builder forms,\nProof to the wintry winds and howling storms,\nTheir tops connected, but at wider space\nFix'd on the centre stands their solid base.\nNow to the grasp each manly body bends;\nThe humid sweat from every pore descends;\nTheir bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs\nSwell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.\nNor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,\nO'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;\nNor could the strength of Ajax overthrow\nThe watchful caution of his artful foe.\nWhile the long strife even tired the lookers on,\nThus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:\n\"Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:\nProve we our force, and Jove the rest decree.\"\nHe said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground\nWith matchless strength; that time Ulysses found\nThe strength to evade, and where the nerves combine\nHis ankle struck: the giant fell supine;\nUlysses, following, on his bosom lies;\nShouts of applause run rattling through the skies.\nAjax to lift Ulysses next essays;\nHe barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:\nHis knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;\nAnd grappling close, they tumbled side by side.\nDefiled with honourable dust they roll,\nStill breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:\nAgain they rage, again to combat rise;\nWhen great Achilles thus divides the prize:\n\"Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;\nNor weary out your generous strength in vain.\nYe both have won: let others who excel,\nNow prove that prowess you have proved so well.\"",

He who can,\nMust yet be more than hero, more than man.\"\nThe effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,\n\"Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.\nNor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;\nReceive a talent of the purest gold.\"\nThe youth departs content. The host admire\nThe son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.\nNext these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;\nCast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:\nArms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,\nAnd great Patroclus in short triumph bore.\n\"Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)\nWhoever dares deserve so rich a prize,\nNow grace the lists before our army's sight,\nAnd sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.\nWho first the jointed armour shall explore,\nAnd stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,\nThe sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old,\n(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)\nShall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side:\nThese arms in common let the chiefs divide:\nFor each brave champion, when the combat ends,\nA sumptuous banquet at our tents attends.\"\nFierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son,\nAnd the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.\nClad in refulgent steel, on either hand,\nThe dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;\nLouring they meet, tremendous to the sight;\nEach Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.\nOpposed in arms not long they idly stood,\nBut thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.\nA furious pass the spear of Ajax made\nThrough the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.\nNot thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above\nThe buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.\nBut Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,\nBade share the honours, and surcease the strife.\nYet still the victor's due Tydides gains,\nWith him the sword and studded belt remains.\nThen hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground,\nA mass of iron (an enormous round),\nWhose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,\nRude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.\nThis mighty quoit A\u00ebtion wont to rear,\nAnd from his whirling arm dismiss in air;\nThe giant by Achilles slain, he stow'd\nAmong his spoils this memorable load.\nFor this, he bids those nervous artists vie,\nThat teach the disk to sound along the sky.\n\"Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;\nWho farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;\nIf he be one enrich'd with large domain\nOf downs for flocks, and arable for grain,\nSmall stock of iron needs that man provide;\nHis hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied\nFrom hence; nor ask the neighbouring city's aid\nFor ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.\"\nStern Polyp\u0153tes stepp'd before the throng,\nAnd great Leonteus, more than mortal strong;\nWhose force with rival forces to oppose,\nUprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.\nEach stood in order: first Epeus threw;\nHigh o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.\nLeonteus next a little space surpass'd;\nAnd third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.\nO'er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung\nFrom Polyp\u0153tes' arm the discus sung:\nFar as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,\nThat distant falls among the grazing cows,\nSo past them all the rapid circle flies:\nHis friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,\nWith force conjoin'd heave off the weighty prize.\nThose, who in skilful archery contend,\nHe next invites the twanging bow to bend;\nAnd twice ten axes casts amidst the round,\nTen double-edged, and ten that singly wound\nThe mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,\nThe hero fixes in the sandy shore;\nTo the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,\nThe trembling mark at which their arrows fly.\n\"Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear\nThese two-edged axes, terrible in war;\nThe single, he whose shaft divides the cord.\"\nHe said: experienced Merion took the word;\nAnd skilful Teucer: in the helm they threw\nTheir lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.\nSwift from the string the sounding arrow flies;\nBut flies unbless'd! No grateful sacrifice,\nNo firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow\nTo Ph\u0153bus, patron of the shaft and bow.\nFor this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,\nErr'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:\nAdown the mainmast fell the parted string,\nAnd the free bird to heaven displays her wing:\nSea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,\nAnd Merion eager meditates the wound:\nHe takes the bow, directs the shaft above,\nAnd following with his eye the soaring dove,\nImplores the god to speed it through the skies,\nWith vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrifice,\nThe dove, in airy circles as she wheels,\nAmid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;\nQuite through and through the point its passage found,\nAnd at his feet fell bloody to the ground.\nThe wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,\nWith flagging wings alighted on the mast,\nA moment hung, and spread her pinions there,\nThen sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.\nFrom the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,\nAnd to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.",

Bear thy lot, nor shed\nThese unavailing sorrows o'er the dead;\nThou canst not call him from the Stygian shore,\nBut thou, alas! may'st live to suffer more!\"\nTo whom the king: \"O favour'd of the skies!\nHere let me grow to earth! since Hector lies\nOn the bare beach deprived of obsequies.\nO give me Hector! to my eyes restore\nHis corse, and take the gifts: I ask no more.\nThou, as thou may'st, these boundless stores enjoy;\nSafe may'st thou sail, and turn thy wrath from Troy;\nSo shall thy pity and forbearance give\nA weak old man to see the light and live!\"\n\"Move me no more, (Achilles thus replies,\nWhile kindling anger sparkled in his eyes,)\nNor seek by tears my steady soul to bend:\nTo yield thy Hector I myself intend:\nFor know, from Jove my goddess-mother came,\n(Old Ocean's daughter, silver-footed dame,)\nNor comest thou but by heaven; nor comest alone,\nSome god impels with courage not thy own:\nNo human hand the weighty gates unbarr'd,\nNor could the boldest of our youth have dared\nTo pass our outworks, or elude the guard.\nCease; lest, neglectful of high Jove's command,\nI show thee, king! thou tread'st on hostile land;\nRelease my knees, thy suppliant arts give o'er,\nAnd shake the purpose of my soul no more.\"\nThe sire obey'd him, trembling and o'eraw'd.\nAchilles, like a lion, rush'd abroad:\nAutomedon and Alcimus attend,\n(Whom most he honour'd, since he lost his friend,)\nThese to unyoke the mules and horses went,\nAnd led the hoary herald to the tent;\nNext, heap'd on high, the numerous presents bear,\n(Great Hector's ransom,) from the polish'd car.\nTwo splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,\nThey leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.\nThen call the handmaids, with assistant toil\nTo wash the body and anoint with oil,\nApart from Priam: lest the unhappy sire,\nProvoked to passion, once more rouse to ire\nThe stern Pelides; and nor sacred age,\nNor Jove's command, should check the rising rage.\nThis done, the garments o'er the corse they spread;\nAchilles lifts it to the funeral bed:\nThen, while the body on the car they laid,\nHe groans, and calls on loved Patroclus' shade:\n\"If, in that gloom which never light must know,\nThe deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,\nO friend! forgive me, that I thus fulfil\n(Restoring Hector) heaven's unquestion'd will.\nThe gifts the father gave, be ever thine,\nTo grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine.\"[296]\nHe said, and, entering, took his seat of state;\nWhere full before him reverend Priam sate;\nTo whom, composed, the godlike chief begun:\n\"Lo! to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son;\nExtended on the funeral couch he lies;\nAnd soon as morning paints the eastern skies,\nThe sight is granted to thy longing eyes:\nBut now the peaceful hours of sacred night\nDemand reflection, and to rest invite:\nNor thou, O father!

have other parents known;\nRemember theirs, and mitigate thy own.\nThe care of heaven thy Hector has appear'd,\nNor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr'd;\nSoon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown'd,\nAnd all the eyes of Ilion stream around.\"\nHe said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe\nWith silver fleece, which his attendants slew.\nThe limbs they sever from the reeking hide,\nWith skill prepare them, and in parts divide:\nEach on the coals the separate morsels lays,\nAnd, hasty, snatches from the rising blaze.\nWith bread the glittering canisters they load,\nWhich round the board Automedon bestow'd.\nThe chief himself to each his portion placed,\nAnd each indulging shared in sweet repast.\nWhen now the rage of hunger was repress'd,\nThe wondering hero eyes his royal guest:\nNo less the royal guest the hero eyes,\nHis godlike aspect and majestic size;\nHere, youthful grace and noble fire engage;\nAnd there, the mild benevolence of age.\nThus gazing long, the silence neither broke,\n(A solemn scene!) at length the father spoke:\n\"Permit me now, beloved of Jove! to steep\nMy careful temples in the dew of sleep:\nFor, since the day that number'd with the dead\nMy hapless son, the dust has been my bed;\nSoft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;\nMy only food, my sorrows and my sighs!\nTill now, encouraged by the grace you give,\nI share thy banquet, and consent to live.\"\nWith that, Achilles bade prepare the bed,\nWith purple soft and shaggy carpets spread;\nForth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,\nAnd place the couches, and the coverings lay.\nThen he: \"Now, father, sleep, but sleep not here;\nConsult thy safety, and forgive my fear,\nLest any Argive, at this hour awake,\nTo ask our counsel, or our orders take,\nApproaching sudden to our open'd tent,\nPerchance behold thee, and our grace prevent.\nShould such report thy honour'd person here,\nThe king of men the ransom might defer;\nBut say with speed, if aught of thy desire\nRemains unask'd; what time the rites require\nTo inter thy Hector? For, so long we stay\nOur slaughtering arm, and bid the hosts obey.\"",

(she cries)\nSnatch'd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!\nThou to the dismal realms for ever gone!\nAnd I abandon'd, desolate, alone!\nAn only son, once comfort of our pains,\nSad product now of hapless love, remains!\nNever to manly age that son shall rise,\nOr with increasing graces glad my eyes:\nFor Ilion now (her great defender slain)\nShall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.\nWho now protects her wives with guardian care?\nWho saves her infants from the rage of war?\nNow hostile fleets must waft those infants o'er\n(Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:\nThou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,\nThe sad companion of thy mother's woe;\nDriven hence a slave before the victor's sword\nCondemn'd to toil for some inhuman lord:\nOr else some Greek whose father press'd the plain,\nOr son, or brother, by great Hector slain,\nIn Hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,\nAnd hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.[297]\nFor thy stern father never spared a foe:\nThence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!\nThence many evils his sad parents bore,\nHis parents many, but his consort more.\nWhy gav'st thou not to me thy dying hand?\nAnd why received not I thy last command?\nSome word thou would'st have spoke, which, sadly dear,\nMy soul might keep, or utter with a tear;\nWhich never, never could be lost in air,\nFix'd in my heart, and oft repeated there!\"\nThus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,\nHer weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.\nThe mournful mother next sustains her part:\n\"O thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!\nOf all my race thou most by heaven approved,\nAnd by the immortals even in death beloved!\nWhile all my other sons in barbarous bands\nAchilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,\nThis felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,\nFree, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.\nSentenced, 'tis true, by his inhuman doom,\nThy noble corse was dragg'd around the tomb;\n(The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)\nUngenerous insult, impotent and vain!\nYet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace;\nNo mark of pain, or violence of face:\nRosy and fair! as Ph\u0153bus' silver bow\nDismiss'd thee gently to the shades below.\"\nThus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.\nSad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;\nFast from the shining sluices of her eyes\nFall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.\n\"Ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join'd[298]\nThe mildest manners with the bravest mind,\nNow twice ten years (unhappy years) are o'er\nSince Paris brought me to the Trojan shore,\n(O had I perish'd, ere that form divine\nSeduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)\nYet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find\nA deed ungentle, or a word unkind.\nWhen others cursed the authoress of their woe,\nThy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.\nIf some proud brother eyed me with disdain,\nOr scornful sister with her sweeping train,\nThy gentle accents soften'd all my pain.\nFor thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,\nThe wretched source of all this misery.\nThe fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;\nSad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!\nThrough Troy's wide streets abandon'd shall I roam!\nIn Troy deserted, as abhorr'd at home!\"\nSo spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.\nDistressful beauty melts each stander-by.\nOn all around the infectious sorrow grows;\nBut Priam check'd the torrent as it rose:\n\"Perform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,\nAnd fell the forests for a funeral pyre;\nTwelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;\nAchilles grants these honours to the dead.\"[299]\n[Illustration: ] FUNERAL OF HECTOR\nHe spoke, and, at his word, the Trojan train\nTheir mules and oxen harness to the wain,\nPour through the gates, and fell'd from Ida's crown,\nRoll back the gather'd forests to the town.\nThese toils continue nine succeeding days,\nAnd high in air a sylvan structure raise.\nBut when the tenth fair morn began to shine,\nForth to the pile was borne the man divine,\nAnd placed aloft; while all, with streaming eyes,\nBeheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.\nSoon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,\nWith rosy lustre streak'd the dewy lawn,\nAgain the mournful crowds surround the pyre,\nAnd quench with wine the yet remaining fire.\nThe snowy bones his friends and brothers place\n(With tears collected) in a golden vase;\nThe golden vase in purple palls they roll'd,\nOf softest texture, and inwrought with gold.\nLast o'er the urn the sacred earth they spread,\nAnd raised the tomb, memorial of the dead.\n(Strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,\nWatch'd from the rising to the setting sun.)\nAll Troy then moves to Priam's court again,\nA solemn, silent, melancholy train:\nAssembled there, from pious toil they rest,\nAnd sadly shared the last sepulchral feast.\nSuch honours Ilion to her hero paid,\nAnd peaceful slept the mighty Hector's shade.",
