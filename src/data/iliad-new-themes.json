would'st thou know\nWhy angry Ph\u0153bus bends his fatal bow?\nFirst give thy faith, and plight a prince's word\nOf sure protection, by thy power and sword:\nFor I must speak what wisdom would conceal,\nAnd truths, invidious to the great, reveal,\nBold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,\nInstruct a monarch where his error lies;\nFor though we deem the short-lived fury past,\n'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last.\"\nTo whom Pelides:\u2014\"From thy inmost soul\nSpeak what thou know'st, and speak without control.\nE'en by that god I swear who rules the day,\nTo whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.\nAnd whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare;\nLong as Achilles breathes this vital air,\nNo daring Greek, of all the numerous band,\nAgainst his priest shall lift an impious hand;\nNot e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,\nThe king of kings, shall touch that sacred head.\"\nEncouraged thus, the blameless man replies:\n\"Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,\nBut he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,\nApollo's vengeance for his injured priest.\nNor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,\nBut plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,\nTill the great king, without a ransom paid,\nTo her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.[54]\nPerhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,\nThe priest may pardon, and the god may spare.\"\nThe prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown\nThe monarch started from his shining throne;\nBlack choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,\nAnd from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire:\n\"Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,\nProphet of plagues, for ever boding ill!\nStill must that tongue some wounding message bring,\nAnd still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?\nFor this are Ph\u0153bus' oracles explored,\nTo teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?\nFor this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,\nIs heaven offended, and a priest profaned;\nBecause my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,\nAnd heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?\nA maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,\nSkill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace;\nNot half so dear were Clyt\u00e6mnestra's charms,\nWhen first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.\nYet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;\nOur cares are only for the public weal:\nLet me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,\nAnd suffer, rather than my people fall.\nThe prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,\nSo dearly valued, and so justly mine.\nBut since for common good I yield the fair,\nMy private loss let grateful Greece repair;\nNor unrewarded let your prince complain,\nThat he alone has fought and bled in vain.\"\n\"Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),\nFond of the power, but fonder of the prize!\nWould'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,\nThe due reward of many a well-fought field?\nThe spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,\nWe share with justice, as with toil we gain;\nBut to resume whate'er thy avarice craves\n(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.\nYet if our chief for plunder only fight,\nThe spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,\nWhene'er, by Jove's decree, our conquering powers\nShall humble to the dust her lofty towers.\"\nThen thus the king: \"Shall I my prize resign\nWith tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?\nGreat as thou art, and like a god in fight,\nThink not to rob me of a soldier's right.\nAt thy demand shall I restore the maid?\nFirst let the just equivalent be paid;\nSuch as a king might ask; and let it be\nA treasure worthy her, and worthy me.\nOr grant me this, or with a monarch's claim\nThis hand shall seize some other captive dame.\nThe mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;[55]\nUlysses' spoils, or even thy own, be mine.\nThe man who suffers, loudly may complain;\nAnd rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.\nBut this when time requires.\u2014It now remains\nWe launch a bark to plough the watery plains,\nAnd waft the sacrifice to Chrysa's shores,\nWith chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.\nSoon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,\nAnd some deputed prince the charge attend:\nThis Creta's king, or Ajax shall fulfil,\nOr wise Ulysses see perform'd our will;\nOr, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,\nAchilles' self conduct her o'er the main;\nLet fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,\nThe god propitiate, and the pest assuage.\"\n[Illustration: ] MARS\nAt this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:\n\"O tyrant, arm'd with insolence and pride!\nInglorious slave to interest, ever join'd\nWith fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!\nWhat generous Greek, obedient to thy word,\nShall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?\nWhat cause have I to war at thy decree?\nThe distant Trojans never injured me;\nTo Phthia's realms no hostile troops they led:\nSafe in her vales my warlike coursers fed;\nFar hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,\nAnd walls of rocks, secure my native reign,\nWhose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,\nRich in her fruits, and in her martial race.\nHither we sail'd, a voluntary throng,\nTo avenge a private, not a public wrong:\nWhat else to Troy the assembled nations draws,\nBut thine, ungrateful, and thy brother's cause?\nIs this the pay our blood and toils deserve;\nDisgraced and injured by the man we serve?\nAnd darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,\nDue to the deeds of many a dreadful day?\nA prize as small, O tyrant!

led:\nIf so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare,\nAnd far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\nThat mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;\nNot thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,\nSprung though he was from more than mortal bed;\nNot thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,\nIn rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might.\"\nHector obedient heard: and, with a bound,\nLeap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;\nThrough all his host inspiring force he flies,\nAnd bids the thunder of the battle rise.\nWith rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,\nAnd turn the tide of conflict on the foe:\nFierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;\nAll Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;\nSome god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,\nShot down avenging from the vault of stars.\nThen thus aloud: \"Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!\nAnd you whom distant nations send to war!\nBe mindful of the strength your fathers bore;\nBe still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.\nOne hour demands me in the Trojan wall,\nTo bid our altars flame, and victims fall:\nNor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,\nAnd reverend elders, seek the gods in vain.\"\nThis said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;\nThe shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,\nHis neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;\nAnd as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.\nNow paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),[167]\nWhere daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son\nBetween both armies met: the chiefs from far\nObserved each other, and had mark'd for war.\nNear as they drew, Tydides thus began:\n\"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?\nOur eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,\nWhere fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;\nYet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,\nAnd meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.\nUnhappy they, and born of luckless sires,\nWho tempt our fury when Minerva fires!\nBut if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,\nKnow with immortals we no more contend.\nNot long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,\nThat daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.\nBacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,\nWith brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:\nTheir consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,\nWith curling vines and twisted ivy bound;\nWhile Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,\nAnd Thetis' arms received the trembling god.\nNor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;\n(The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)\nDeprived of sight by their avenging doom,\nCheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,\nThen sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,\nA wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!\nI brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth\nSustain thy life, and human be thy birth,\nBold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,\nApproach, and enter the dark gates of death.\"\n\"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,\n(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?\nLike leaves on trees the race of man is found,\nNow green in youth, now withering on the ground;\nAnother race the following spring supplies;\nThey fall successive, and successive rise:\nSo generations in their course decay;\nSo flourish these, when those are pass'd away.\nBut if thou still persist to search my birth,\nThen hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.\n\"A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,\n(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)\n\u00c6olian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,\nIn ancient time the happy wall possess'd,\nThen call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;\nGreat Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,\nWho o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,\nLoved for that valour which preserves mankind.\nThen mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,\nWhose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.\nWith direful jealousy the monarch raged,\nAnd the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.\nFor him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,\nAnd strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:\nIn vain she tempted the relentless youth,\nEndued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.\nFired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,\nAnd begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:\nIncensed he heard, resolving on his fate;\nBut hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:\nTo Lycia the devoted youth he sent,\nWith tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.[168]\nNow bless'd by every power who guards the good,\nThe chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:\nThere Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,\nNine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.\nBut when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,\nThe faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:\nThe fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,\nThe deathful secret to the king reveal'd.\nFirst, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;\nA mingled monster of no mortal kind!\nBehind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;\nA goat's rough body bore a lion's head;\nHer pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;\nHer gaping throat emits infernal fire.\n\"This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,\nAnd trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)\nThen met in arms the Solym\u00e6an crew,[169]\n(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;\nNext the bold Amazons' whole force defied;\nAnd conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.\n\"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,\nAt his return, a treacherous ambush rose,\nWith levell'd spears along the winding shore:\nThere fell they breathless, and return'd no more.\n\"At length the monarch, with repentant grief,\nConfess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;\nHis daughter gave, the stranger to detain,\nWith half the honours of his ample reign:\nThe Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,\nWith woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.\nThere long the chief his happy lot possess'd,\nWith two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;\n(Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love\nCrown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)\nBut when at last, distracted in his mind,\nForsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,\nWide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,\nA long, forlorn, uncomfortable way![170]\nWoes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:\nHis beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;\nHis eldest born by raging Mars was slain,\nIn combat on the Solymaean plain.\nHippolochus survived: from him I came,\nThe honour'd author of my birth and name;\nBy his decree I sought the Trojan town;\nBy his instructions learn to win renown,\nTo stand the first in worth as in command,\nTo add new honours to my native land,\nBefore my eyes my mighty sires to place,\nAnd emulate the glories of our race.\"\nHe spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;\nIn earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,\nThen friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:\n\"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!\nThus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,\nNor stain the sacred friendship of our race.\nKnow, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;\n\u0152neus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:\nOur ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,\nWhere twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.\nThe parting heroes mutual presents left;\nA golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;\n\u0152neus a belt of matchless work bestowed,\nThat rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.\n(This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored\nAmong my treasures, still adorns my board:\nFor Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall\nBeheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)\nMindful of this, in friendship let us join;\nIf heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,\nMy guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.\nEnough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,\nIn the full harvest of yon ample field;\nEnough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;\nBut thou and Diomed be foes no more.\nNow change we arms, and prove to either host\nWe guard the friendship of the line we boast.\"\nThus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,\nTheir hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;\nBrave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,\n(Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)\nFor Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,\nFor which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)\nHe gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,[171]\nA hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.\nMeantime the guardian of the Trojan state,\nGreat Hector, enter'd at the Sc\u00e6an gate.[172]\nBeneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,\nThe Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids\nAround him flock'd, all press'd with pious care\nFor husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.\nHe bids the train in long procession go,\nAnd seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.\nAnd now to Priam's stately courts he came,\nRais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;\nO'er these a range of marble structure runs,\nThe rich pavilions of his fifty sons,\nIn fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,[173]\nOpposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.\nTwelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,\nOf equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.\nHither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen\nOf royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.\n(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face\nSurpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)\nLong in a strict embrace she held her son,\nAnd press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:\n\"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls\nMy son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;\nCom'st thou to supplicate the almighty power\nWith lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?\nStay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,\nIn Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,\nAnd pay due vows to all the gods around.\nThen with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,\nAnd draw new spirits from the generous bowl;\nSpent as thou art with long laborious fight,\nThe brave defender of thy country's right.\"\n\"Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)\nInflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,\nUnnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.\nLet chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice\nTo sprinkle to the gods, its better use.\nBy me that holy office were profaned;\nIll fits it me, with human gore distain'd,\nTo the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,\nOr offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.\nYou, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,\nAnd burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.\nThe largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,\nMost prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,\nBefore the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,\nAnd twelve young heifers to her altar led.\nSo may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,\nOur wives, our infants, and our city spare;\nAnd far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,\nWho mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.\nBe this, O mother, your religious care:\nI go to rouse soft Paris to the war;\nIf yet not lost to all the sense of shame,\nThe recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.\nOh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,\nThat pest of Troy, that ruin of our race![174]\nDeep to the dark abyss might he descend,\nTroy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end.\"\nThis heard, she gave command: and summon'd came\nEach noble matron and illustrious dame.\nThe Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,\nWhere treasured odours breathed a costly scent.\nThere lay the vestures of no vulgar art,\nSidonian maids embroider'd every part,\nWhom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,\nWith Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.\nHere, as the queen revolved with careful eyes\nThe various textures and the various dyes,\nShe chose a veil that shone superior far,\nAnd glow'd refulgent as the morning star.\nHerself with this the long procession leads;\nThe train majestically slow proceeds.\nSoon as to Ilion's topmost tower they come,\nAnd awful reach the high Palladian dome,\nAntenor's consort, fair Theano, waits\nAs Pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates.\nWith hands uplifted and imploring eyes,\nThey fill the dome with supplicating cries.\nThe priestess then the shining veil displays,\nPlaced on Minerva's knees, and thus she prays:\n\"Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,\nTroy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid!\nBreak thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall\nProne on the dust before the Trojan wall!\nSo twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,\nShall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.\nBut thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,\nOurselves, our infants, and our city spare!\"\nSo pray'd the priestess in her holy fane;\nSo vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.\nWhile these appear before the power with prayers,\nHector to Paris' lofty dome repairs.[175]\nHimself the mansion raised, from every part\nAssembling architects of matchless art.\nNear Priam's court and Hector's palace stands\nThe pompous structure, and the town commands.\nA spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,\nOf full ten cubits was the lance's length,\nThe steely point with golden ringlets join'd,\nBefore him brandish'd, at each motion shined\nThus entering, in the glittering rooms he found\nHis brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,\nHis eyes delighting with their splendid show,\nBrightening the shield, and polishing the bow.\nBeside him Helen with her virgins stands,\nGuides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.\nHim thus inactive, with an ardent look\nThe prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.\n\"Thy hate to Troy, is this the time to show?\n(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country's foe!)\nParis and Greece against us both conspire,\nThy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.\nFor thee great Ilion's guardian heroes fall,\nTill heaps of dead alone defend her wall,\nFor thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,\nAnd wasteful war in all its fury burns.\nUngrateful man! deserves not this thy care,\nOur troops to hearten, and our toils to share?\nRise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,\nAnd all the Phrygian glories at an end.\"\n\"Brother, 'tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)\nThy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:\nYet charge my absence less, O generous chief!\nOn hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief:\nHere, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,\nAnd mourn'd, in secret, his and Ilion's fate.\n'Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms,\nAnd beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.\nConquest to-day my happier sword may bless,\n'Tis man's to fight, but heaven's to give success.\nBut while I arm, contain thy ardent mind;\nOr go, and Paris shall not lag behind.\"\n[Illustration: ] HECTOR CHIDING PARIS\nHe said, nor answer'd Priam's warlike son;\nWhen Helen thus with

To whom the Pylian sage:\n\"Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,\nWhat chief shall combat, let the gods decide.\nWhom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise\nHis country's fame, his own immortal praise.\"\nThe lots produced, each hero signs his own:\nThen in the general's helm the fates are thrown,[181]\nThe people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,\nAnd vows like these ascend from all the bands:\n\"Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,\nA worthy champion for the Grecian state:\nThis task let Ajax or Tydides prove,\nOr he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove.\"\nOld Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,\nLeap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.\nThis from the right to left the herald bears,\nHeld out in order to the Grecian peers;\nEach to his rival yields the mark unknown,\nTill godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;\nSurveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,\nThen casts before him, and with transport cries:\n\"Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;\nBe mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.\nNow while my brightest arms my limbs invest,\nTo Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:\nBut pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,\nAnd deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.\nSaid I in secret? No, your vows declare\nIn such a voice as fills the earth and air,\nLives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?\nAjax, in all the toils of battle bred!\nFrom warlike Salamis I drew my birth,\nAnd, born to combats, fear no force on earth.\"\nHe said. The troops with elevated eyes,\nImplore the god whose thunder rends the skies:\n\"O father of mankind, superior lord!\nOn lofty Ida's holy hill adored:\nWho in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,\nSupreme of gods! unbounded and alone:\nGrant thou, that Telamon may bear away\nThe praise and conquest of this doubtful day;\nOr, if illustrious Hector be thy care,\nThat both may claim it, and that both may share.\"\nNow Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;\nSheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:\nHe moves to combat with majestic pace;\nSo stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,[182]\nWhen Jove to punish faithless men prepares,\nAnd gives whole nations to the waste of wars,\nThus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;\nGrimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:[183]\nHis massy javelin quivering in his hand,\nHe stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.\nThrough every Argive heart new transport ran;\nAll Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:\nEven Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,\nFelt his great heart suspended in his breast:\n'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;\nHimself had challenged, and the foe drew near.\nStern Telamon behind his ample shield,\nAs from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.\nHuge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,\nOf tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,\n(The work of Tychius, who in Hyl\u00e8 dwell'd\nAnd in all arts of armoury excell'd,)\nThis Ajax bore before his manly breast,\nAnd, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:\n\"Hector! approach my arm, and singly know\nWhat strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.\nAchilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,\nNot void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:\nLet him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,\nIndulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;\nWhole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,\nAnd sends thee one, a sample of her host,\nSuch as I am, I come to prove thy might;\nNo more\u2014be sudden, and begin the fight.\"\n\"O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!\n(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)\nMe, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,\nNew to the field, and trembling at the fight?\nThou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,\nTo combat born, and bred amidst alarms:\nI know to shift my ground, remount the car,\nTurn, charge, and answer every call of war;\nTo right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,\nAnd bear thick battle on my sounding shield/\nBut open be our fight, and bold each blow;\nI steal no conquest from a noble foe.\"\nHe said, and rising, high above the field\nWhirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.\nFull on the brass descending from above\nThrough six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,\nTill in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;\nThrough Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,\nHis corslet enters, and his garment rends,\nAnd glancing downwards, near his flank descends.\nThe wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low\nBeneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.\nFrom their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,\nThen close impetuous, and the charge renew;\nFierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,\nOr foaming boars, the terror of the wood.\nAt Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;\nThe blunted point against the buckler bends;\nBut Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,\nDrove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;\nIt reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!\nSpouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.\nYet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,\nIn his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,\nBlack, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;\nFull on the brazen boss the stone descends;\nThe hollow brass resounded with the shock:\nThen Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,\nApplied each nerve, and swinging round on high,\nWith force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;\nThe huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:\nHis slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;\nGreat Hector falls extended on the field,\nHis bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:\nNor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might\nConfirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.\nAnd now both heroes their broad falchions drew\nIn flaming circles round their heads they flew;\nBut then by heralds' voice the word was given.\nThe sacred ministers of earth and heaven:\nDivine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ,\nAnd sage Id\u00e6us on the part of Troy,\nBetween the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;\nAnd first Id\u00e6us' awful voice was heard:\n[Illustration: ] HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS\n\"Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,\nBoth dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.\nTo either host your matchless worth is known,\nEach sounds your praise, and war is all your own.\nBut now the Night extends her awful shade;\nThe goddess parts you; be the night obey'd.\"[184]\nTo whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:\n\"O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.\nLet him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,\nLet him demand the sanction of the night;\nIf first he ask'd it, I content obey,\nAnd cease the strife when Hector shows the way.\"\n\"O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin'd)\nWhom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,\nWith strength of body, and with worth of mind!\nNow martial law commands us to forbear;\nHereafter we shall meet in glorious war,\nSome future day shall lengthen out the strife,\nAnd let the gods decide of death or life!\nSince, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,\nAnd heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.",

Then fate decreed his doom,\nAnd fix'd the date of all his woes to come.\n\"Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;\nWhate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey.\"\n\"O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)\nStill at my heart, and ever at my side!\nThe time is come, when yon despairing host\nShall learn the value of the man they lost:\nNow at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,\nAnd proud Atrides tremble on his throne.\nGo now to Nestor, and from him be taught\nWhat wounded warrior late his chariot brought:\nFor, seen at distance, and but seen behind,\nHis form recall'd Machaon to my mind;\nNor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,\nThe coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace.\"\nThe hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,\nThrough intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;\nThe chiefs descending from their car he found:\nThe panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.\nThe warriors standing on the breezy shore,\nTo dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,\nHere paused a moment, while the gentle gale\nConvey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;\nThen to consult on farther methods went,\nAnd took their seats beneath the shady tent.\nThe draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,\nArsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:\n(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,\nGreece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)\nA table first with azure feet she placed;\nWhose ample orb a brazen charger graced;\nHoney new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,\nAnd wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,\nNext her white hand an antique goblet brings,\nA goblet sacred to the Pylian kings\nFrom eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,\nTwo feet support it, and four handles hold;\nOn each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,\nIn sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:\nA massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,\nWhen the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.\nTemper'd in this, the nymph of form divine\nPours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;\nWith goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,\nAnd last with flour the smiling surface strows:\nThis for the wounded prince the dame prepares:\nThe cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:\nSalubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,\nAnd pleasing conference beguiles the day.",

what flattering hopes I entertain!\nAchilles heeds not, but derides our pain:\nEven till the flames consume our fleet he stays,\nAnd waits the rising of the fatal blaze.\nChief after chief the raging foe destroys;\nCalm he looks on, and every death enjoys.\nNow the slow course of all-impairing time\nUnstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;\nOh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,\nWhen this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,\nThe bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,\nAnd stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!\nThen from my fury fled the trembling swains,\nAnd ours was all the plunder of the plains:\nFifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,\nAs many goats, as many lowing kine:\nAnd thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,\nAll teeming females, and of generous breeds.\nThese, as my first essay of arms, I won;\nOld Neleus gloried in his conquering son.\nThus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,\nAnd shares were parted to each Pylian lord.\nThe state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,\nWhen the proud Elians first commenced the war:\nFor Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;\nOf twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!\nOppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,\nMy sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.\n(That large reprisal he might justly claim,\nFor prize defrauded, and insulted fame,\nWhen Elis' monarch, at the public course,\nDetain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)\nThe rest the people shared; myself survey'd\nThe just partition, and due victims paid.\nThree days were past, when Elis rose to war,\nWith many a courser, and with many a car;\nThe sons of Actor at their army's head\n(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.\nHigh on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,\nOur utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:\nNot far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:\nThe stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.\nPallas, descending in the shades of night,\nAlarms the Pylians and commands the fight.\nEach burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,\nMyself the foremost; but my sire denied;\nFear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;\nAnd stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.\nMy sire denied in vain: on foot I fled\nAmidst our chariots; for the goddess led.\n\"Along fair Arene's delightful plain\nSoft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:\nThere, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,\nAnd sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.\nThence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,\nTo great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.\nThere first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;\nAn untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;\nA bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain\nTo the blue monarch of the watery main.\nIn arms we slept, beside the winding flood,\nWhile round the town the fierce Epeians stood.\nSoon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,\nFlamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.\nBright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;\nThe nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.\nThe first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;\nKing Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:\n(She that all simples' healing virtues knew,\nAnd every herb that drinks the morning dew:)\nI seized his car, the van of battle led;\nThe Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.\nThe foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,\nFierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:\nFull fifty captive chariots graced my train;\nTwo chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.\nThen Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds\nThe youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.\nO'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,\nCollecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,\nThrough wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,\nWhere o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;\nTill Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.\nEven there the hindmost of the rear I slay,\nAnd the same arm that led concludes the day;\nThen back to Pyle triumphant take my way.\nThere to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,\nAs first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.\nSuch then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;\nSo proved my valour for my country's good.\n\"Achilles with unactive fury glows,\nAnd gives to passion what to Greece he owes.\nHow shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade\nHer hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!\nO friend! my memory recalls the day,\nWhen, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,\nI, and Ulysses, touch'd at Phthia's port,\nAnd entered Peleus' hospitable court.\nA bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,\nAnd pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.\nThyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire\nMenoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.\nAchilles sees us, to the feast invites;\nSocial we sit, and share the genial rites.\nWe then explained the cause on which we came,\nUrged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.\nYour ancient fathers generous precepts gave;\nPeleus said only this:\u2014'My son! be brave.'\nMenoetius thus: 'Though great Achilles shine\nIn strength superior, and of race divine,\nYet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;\nLet thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'\nThus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:\nWords now forgot, though now of vast import.\nAh! try the utmost that a friend can say:\nSuch gentle force the fiercest minds obey;\nSome favouring god Achilles' heart may move;\nThough deaf to glory, he may yield to love.\nIf some dire oracle his breast alarm,\nIf aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,\nSome beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,\nIf thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;\nClad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,\nProud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;\nPress'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train\nShall seek their walls, and Greece respire again.\"\nThis touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent\nAlong the shore with hasty strides he went;\nSoon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,\nThe public mart and courts of justice stand,\nWhere the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,\nAnd altars to the guardian gods arise;\nThere, sad, he met the brave Euaemon's son,\nLarge painful drops from all his members run;\nAn arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,\nThe sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.\nAs faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,\nWeak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.\nDivine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,\nWho, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd:\n\"Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!\nThus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?\nIs this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,\nFar from your friends, and from your native shore?\nSay, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?\nResists she yet the raging Hector's hand?\nOr are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,\nAnd this the period of our wars and fame?\"\nEurypylus replies: \"No more, my friend;\nGreece is no more! this day her glories end;\nEven to the ships victorious Troy pursues,\nHer force increasing as her toil renews.\nThose chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,\nLie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.\nBut, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,\nLead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;\nWith lukewarm water wash the gore away;\nWith healing balms the raging smart allay,\nSuch as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,\nOnce taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.\nOf two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands\nThis hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;\nAnd great Machaon, wounded in his tent,\nNow wants that succour which so oft he lent.\"\nTo him the chief: \"What then remains to do?\nThe event of things the gods alone can view.\nCharged by Achilles' great command I fly,\nAnd bear with haste the Pylian king's reply:\nBut thy distress this instant claims relief.\"\nHe said, and in his arms upheld the chief.\nThe slaves their master's slow approach survey'd,\nAnd hides of oxen on the floor display'd:\nThere stretch'd at length the wounded hero lay;\nPatroclus cut the forky steel away:\nThen in his hands a bitter root he bruised;\nThe wound he wash'd, the styptic juice infused.\nThe closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,\nThe wound to torture, and the blood to flow.\n[Illustration: ] HERCULES",

Across the warrior's way,\nRent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;\nIn modern ages not the strongest swain\nCould heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:\nHe poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,\nIt flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;\nFull on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,\nThe ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.\nAs skilful divers from some airy steep\nHeadlong descend, and shoot into the deep,\nSo falls Epicles; then in groans expires,\nAnd murmuring to the shades the soul retires.\nWhile to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,\nFrom Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;\nThe bearded shaft the destined passage found,\nAnd on his naked arm inflicts a wound.\nThe chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast\nMight stop the progress of his warlike host,\nConceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height\nRetired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.\nDivine Sarpedon with regret beheld\nDisabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;\nHis beating breast with generous ardour glows,\nHe springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.\nAlcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;\nDeep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;\nThen from the yawning wound with fury tore\nThe spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:\nDown sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,\nHis brazen armour rings against the ground.\nSwift to the battlement the victor flies,\nTugs with full force, and every nerve applies:\nIt shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;\nThe rolling ruins smoke along the field.\nA mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;\nAnd, like a deluge, rushes in the war.\nAt once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,\nAnd Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;\nFix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,\nAnd through his buckler drove the trembling wood;\nBut Jove was present in the dire debate,\nTo shield his offspring, and avert his fate.\nThe prince gave back, not meditating flight,\nBut urging vengeance, and severer fight;\nThen raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,\nHis fainting squadrons to new fury warms.\n\"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?\nYour former fame and ancient virtue lost!\nThe breach lies open, but your chief in vain\nAttempts alone the guarded pass to gain:\nUnite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:\nThe force of powerful union conquers all.\"\nThis just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;\nThey join, they thicken, and the assault renew:\nUnmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,\nAnd fix'd support the weight of all the war;\nNor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,\nNor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.\nAs on the confines of adjoining grounds,\nTwo stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;\nThey tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,\nOne foot, one inch, of the contended field;\nThus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;\nNor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.",

the voice of war to martial fame,\nFrom high Cabesus' distant walls he came;\nCassandra's love he sought, with boasts of power,\nAnd promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.\nThe king consented, by his vaunts abused;\nThe king consented, but the fates refused.\nProud of himself, and of the imagined bride,\nThe field he measured with a larger stride.\nHim as he stalk'd, the Cretan javelin found;\nVain was his breastplate to repel the wound:\nHis dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;\nHis arms resounded as the boaster fell.\nThe great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;\n\"And thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!\nSuch is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,\nAnd such the contract of the Phrygian king!\nOur offers now, illustrious prince! receive;\nFor such an aid what will not Argos give?\nTo conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,\nAnd count Atrides' fairest daughter thine.\nMeantime, on further methods to advise,\nCome, follow to the fleet thy new allies;\nThere hear what Greece has on her part to say.\"\nHe spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.\nThis Asius view'd, unable to contain,\nBefore his chariot warring on the plain:\n(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,\nImpatient panted on his neck behind:)\nTo vengeance rising with a sudden spring,\nHe hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.\nThe wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,\nFull on his throat discharged the forceful spear:\nBeneath the chin the point was seen to glide,\nAnd glitter'd, extant at the further side.\nAs when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,\nOr pine, fit mast for some great admiral,\nGroans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,\nThen spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground:\nSo sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,\nAnd stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.\nHe grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,\nAnd, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.\nDeprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,\nStands all aghast his trembling charioteer,\nNor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,\nBut falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:\nPierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath\nThe stately car, and labours out his breath.\nThus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)\nRemain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.\nStabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,\nAnd made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.\nThe Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance\nFrom his slope shield the disappointed lance.\nBeneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,\nThick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,\nOn his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,)\nHe lay collected in defensive shade.\nO'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,\nAnd on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.\nEven then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,\nAnd pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast:\nWarm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore\nThe chief, his people's guardian now no more!\n\"Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)\nNor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:\nFor thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,\nThis mate shall joy thy melancholy shade.\"\nHeart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,\nTouch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most.\nGrieved as he was, his pious arms attend,\nAnd his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend:\nTill sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore\nHis honour'd body to the tented shore.\nNor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;\nResolved to perish in his country's cause,\nOr find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom\nTo wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.\nHe sees Alcathous in the front aspire:\nGreat \u00c6syetes was the hero's sire;\nHis spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,\nAnchises' eldest hope, and darling care:\nWho charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart\nWith beauty, sense, and every work of art:\nHe once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy,\nThe fairest she of all the fair of Troy.\nBy Neptune now the hapless hero dies,\nWho covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,\nAnd fetters every limb: yet bent to meet\nHis fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.\nFix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,\nWhile the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.\nBefore the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,\nLong used to ward the death in fighting fields.\nThe riven armour sends a jarring sound;\nHis labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,\nThe long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;\nFast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,\nLife's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.\nThen Idomen, insulting o'er the slain:\n\"Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:\nSee! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;\nThis, my third victim, to the shades I send.\nApproaching now thy boasted might approve,\nAnd try the prowess of the seed of Jove.\nFrom Jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,\nGreat Minos, guardian of his country, came:\nDeucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir;\nHis first-born I, the third from Jupiter:\nO'er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,\nAnd thence my ships transport me through the main:\nLord of a host, o'er all my host I shine,\nA scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line.\"\nThe Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,\nAlone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,\nOr seek auxiliar force; at length decreed\nTo call some hero to partake the deed,\nForthwith \u00c6neas rises to his thought:\nFor him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,\nWhere he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,\nAnd sees superior posts in meaner hands.\nTo him, ambitious of so great an aid,\nThe bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said:\n\"Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,\nIf e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.\nAlcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;\nCome, and the warrior's loved remains defend.\nBeneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,\nOne table fed you, and one roof contain'd.\nThis deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;\nHaste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe.\"\n\u00c6neas heard, and for a space resign'd\nTo tender pity all his manly mind;\nThen rising in his rage, he burns to fight:\nThe Greek awaits him with collected might.\nAs the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,\nArm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,\nWhen the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,\nAttends the tumult, and expects the war;\nO'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;\nFires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,\nHis foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;\nBut most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:\nSo stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,\nAnd met the Trojan with a lowering look.\nAntilochus, Deipyrus, were near,\nThe youthful offspring of the god of war,\nMerion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:\nTo these the warrior sent his voice around.\n\"Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;\nLo, great \u00c6neas rushes to the fight:\nSprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;\nHe fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.\nElse should this hand, this hour decide the strife,\nThe great dispute, of glory, or of life.\"\nHe spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;\nTheir lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade\nAround the chief. \u00c6neas too demands\nTh' assisting forces of his native bands;\nParis, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;\n(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)\nIn order follow all th' embodied train,\nLike Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;\nBefore his fleecy care, erect and bold,\nStalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.\nWith joy the swain surveys them, as he leads\nTo the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:\nSo joys \u00c6neas, as his native band\nMoves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.\nRound dread Alcathous now the battle rose;\nOn every side the steely circle grows;\nNow batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,\nAnd o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.\nAbove the rest, two towering chiefs appear,\nThere great Idomeneus, \u00c6neas here.\nLike gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,\nAnd burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.\nThe Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;\nThe Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:\nSent from an arm so strong, the missive wood\nStuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.\nBut OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;\nThe forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,\nIt ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,\nAnd roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.\nStretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,\nAnd, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.\nThe victor from his breast the weapon tears;\nHis spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.\nThough now unfit an active war to wage,\nHeavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,\nHis listless limbs unable for the course,\nIn standing fight he yet maintains his force;\nTill faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,\nHis tired slow steps he drags from off the field.\nDeiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,\nAnd, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:\nThe javelin err'd, but held its course along,\nAnd pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:\nThe son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,\nAnd gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.\nNor knew the furious father of his fall;\nHigh-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,\nOn golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;\nDetain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.\nNow, where in dust the breathless hero lay,\nFor slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,\nDeiphobus to seize his helmet flies,\nAnd from his temples rends the glittering prize;\nValiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,\nAnd on his loaded arm discharged his spear:\nHe drops the weight, disabled with the pain;\nThe hollow helmet rings against the plain.\nSwift as a vulture leaping on his prey,\nFrom his torn arm the Grecian rent away\nThe reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.\nHis wounded brother good Polites tends;\nAround his waist his pious arms he threw,\nAnd from the rage of battle gently drew:\nHim his swift coursers, on his splendid car,\nRapt from the lessening thunder of the war;\nTo Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,\nAnd sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.\nMeanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,\nHeaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.\nBold Aphareus by great \u00c6neas bled;\nAs toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,\nHe pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd\nBeneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;\nHis shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,\nAnd everlasting slumber seals his eyes.\nAntilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,\nTranspierced his back with a dishonest wound:\nThe hollow vein, that to the neck extends\nAlong the chine, his eager javelin rends:\nSupine he falls, and to his social train\nSpreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.\nThv exulting victor, leaping where he lay,\nFrom his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;\nHis time observed; for closed by foes around,\nOn all sides thick the peals of arms resound.\nHis shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,\nBut he impervious and untouch'd remains.\n(Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage\nThis youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)\nIn arms intrepid, with the first he fought,\nFaced every foe, and every danger sought;\nHis winged lance, resistless as the wind,\nObeys each motion of the master's mind!\nRestless it flies, impatient to be free,\nAnd meditates the distant enemy.\nThe son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,\nAnd struck his target with the brazen spear\nFierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,\nAnd blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:\nIn the broad buckler half the weapon stood,\nSplinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.\nDisarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;\nBut Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,\nDeep in the belly's rim an entrance found,\nWhere sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.\nBending he fell, and doubled to the ground,\nLay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,\nWhile death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,\nHis bulk enormous on the field displays;\nHis heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.\nThe spear the conqueror from his body drew,\nAnd death's dim shadows swarm before his view.\nNext brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:\nKing Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,\nAnd smote his temples with an arm so strong,\nThe helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:\nThere for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;\nFor dark in death the godlike owner lies!\nRaging with grief, great Menelaus burns,\nAnd fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:\nThat shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;\nAnd this stood adverse with the bended bow:\nFull on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,\nBut harmless bounded from the plated steel.\nAs on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,\n(The winds collected at each open door,)\nWhile the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,\nLight leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:\nSo from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,\nRepell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.\nAtrides, watchful of the unwary foe,\nPierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.\nAnd nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand\nTrail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:\nBut good Agenor gently from the wound\nThe spear solicits, and the bandage bound;\nA sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,\nAt once the tent and ligature supplied.\nBehold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,\nSprings through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,\nGreat Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:\nHigh-towering in the front, the warrior came.\nFirst the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;\nThe lance far distant by the winds was blown.\nNor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:\nPisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.\nNot so discouraged, to the future blind,\nVain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;\nDauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord\nLike lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.\nHis left arm high opposed the shining shield:\nHis right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;\n(An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,\nDistinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)\nThis on the helm discharged a noble blow;\nThe plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,\nShorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:\nDeep through his front the weighty falchion fell;\nThe crashing bones before its force gave way;\nIn dust and blood the groaning hero lay:\nForced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,\nThe clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.\nAnd fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,\nTore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:\n\"Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;\nO race perfidious, who delight in war!\nAlready noble deeds ye have perform'd;\nA princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:\nIn such bold feats your impious might approve,\nWithout th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.\nThe violated rites, the ravish'd dame;\nOur heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,\nCrimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,\nAnd whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.\nO thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,\nAbove the thought of man, supremely wise!\nIf from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,\nFrom whence this favour to an impious foe?\nA godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,\nStill breathing rapine, violence, and lust?\nThe best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;\nSleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;\nThe feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,\nEven the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.\nBut Troy for ever reaps a dire delight\nIn thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight.\"\nThis said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)\nThe bloody armour, which his train received:\nThen sudden mix'd among the warring crew,\nAnd the bold son of Pyl\u00e6menes slew.\nHarpalion had through Asia travell'd far,\nFollowing his martial father to the war:\nThrough filial love he left his native shore,\nNever, ah, never to behold it more!\nHis unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling\nAgainst the target of the Spartan king;\nThus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,\nAnd turns around his apprehensive eyes.\nHim, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,\nThe shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.\nBeneath the bone the glancing point descends,\nAnd, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:\nSunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,\nAnd in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;\n(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)\nWhile life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.\nHim on his car the Paphlagonian train\nIn slow procession bore from off the plain.\nThe pensive father, father now no more!\nAttends the mournful pomp along the shore;\nAnd unavailing tears profusely shed;\nAnd, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.\nParis from far the moving sight beheld,\nWith pity soften'd and with fury swell'd:\nHis honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,\nAnd loved of all the Paphlagonian race!\nWith his full strength he bent his angry bow,\nAnd wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.\nA chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,\nFor riches much, and more for virtue famed.\nWho held his seat in Corinth's stately town;\nPolydus' son, a seer of old renown.\nOft had the father told his early doom,\nBy arms abroad, or slow disease at home:\nHe climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,\nAnd chose the certain glorious path to death.\nBeneath his ear the pointed arrow went;\nThe soul came issuing at the narrow vent:\nHis limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,\nAnd everlasting darkness shades him round.\nNor knew great Hector how his legions yield,\n(Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)\nWide on the left the force of Greece commands,\nAnd conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands;\nWith such a tide superior virtue sway'd,\nAnd he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.\nBut in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd,\nWhere first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;\nThere, on the margin of the hoary deep,\n(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.\nAnd where low walls confine the beating tides,\nWhose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;\nWhere late in fight both foot and horse engaged,\nAnd all the thunder of the battle raged,)\nThere join'd, the whole B\u0153otian strength remains,\nThe proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,\nLocrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;\nBut join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.\nThe flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;\nBias and great Menestheus at their head:\nMeges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,\nAnd Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:\nThe Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,\nAnd brave Podarces, active in the fight.\nThis drew from Phylacus his noble line;\nIphiclus' son: and that (O\u00efleus) thine:\n(Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace;\nHe dwelt far distant from his native place,\nBy his fierce step-dame from his father's reign\nExpell'd and exiled for her brother slain:)\nThese rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,\nMix'd with B\u0153otians, on the shores of Troy.\nNow side by side, with like unwearied care,\nEach Ajax laboured through the field of war:\nSo when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,\nForce the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,\nJoin'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,\nAnd trace large furrows with the shining share;\nO'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,\nAnd streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.\nA train of heroes followed through the field,\nWho bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;\nWhene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,\nTired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.\nNo following troops his brave associate grace:\nIn close engagement an unpractised race,\nThe Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,\nNor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;\nBut skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,\nOr whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,\nDexterous with these they aim a certain wound,\nOr fell the distant warrior to the ground.\nThus in the van the Telamonian train,\nThrong'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:\nFar in the rear the Locrian archers lie,\nWhose stones and arrows intercept the sky,\nThe mingled tempest on the foes they pour;\nTroy's scattering orders open to the shower.\nNow had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,\nAnd the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired;\nBut sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,\nAddress'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:\n\"Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend\nImpartial audience to a faithful friend;\nTo gods and men thy matchless worth is known,\nAnd every art of glorious war thy own;\nBut in cool thought and counsel to excel,\nHow widely differs this from warring well!\nContent with what the bounteous gods have given,\nSeek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.\nTo some the powers of bloody war belong,\nTo some sweet music and the charm of song;\nTo few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd\nA wise, extensive, all-considering mind;\nTheir guardians these, the nations round confess,\nAnd towns and empires for their safety bless.\nIf Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,\nAttend, O Hector! what I judge the best,\nSee, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,\nAnd war's whole fury burns around thy head.\nBehold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,\nHow many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!\nWhat troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!\nAnd what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!\nHere cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings\nConvoked to council, weigh the sum of things.\nWhether (the gods succeeding our desires)\nTo yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;\nOr quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,\nContented with the conquest of the day.\nI fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,\nPay the large debt of last revolving sun;\nAchilles, great Achilles, yet remains\nOn yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!\"\nThe counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,\nLeap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;\nSwift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.\n\"To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,\nAnd here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;\nWhere yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,\nAnd hasten back to end the doubtful day.\"\nThis said, the towering chief prepares to go,\nShakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,\nAnd seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.\nThrough all his host, inspiring force, he flies,\nAnd bids anew the martial thunder rise.\nTo Panthus' son, at Hector's high command\nHaste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:\nBut round the battlements, and round the plain,\nFor many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain;\nDeiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,\nNor Asius' son, nor Asius' self appear:\nFor these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,\nSome cold in death, some groaning on the ground;\nSome low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;\nHigh on the wall some breathed their souls away.\nFar on the left, amid the throng he found\n(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)\nThe graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,\nOpprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved:\n\"Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,\nAs smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!\nWhere is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?\nThe godlike father, and th' intrepid son?\nThe force of Helenus, dispensing fate;\nAnd great Othryoneus, so fear'd of late?\nBlack fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods,\nImperial Troy from her foundations nods;\nWhelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall,\nAnd one devouring vengeance swallow all.\"\nWhen Paris thus: \"My brother and my friend,\nThy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,\nIn other battles I deserved thy blame,\nThough then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:\nBut since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,\nI scatter'd slaughter from my fatal bow.\nThe chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;\nOf all those heroes, two alone remain;\nDeiphobus, and Helenus the seer,\nEach now disabled by a hostile spear.\nGo then, successful, where thy soul inspires:\nThis heart and hand shall second all thy fires:\nWhat with this arm I can, prepare to know,\nTill death for death be paid, and blow for blow.\nBut 'tis not ours, with forces not our own\nTo combat: strength is of the gods alone.\"\nThese words the hero's angry mind assuage:\nThen fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.\nAround Polydamas, distain'd with blood,\nCebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,\nPalmus, with Polyp\u0153tes the divine,\nAnd two bold brothers of Hippotion's line\n(Who reach'd fair Ilion, from Ascania far,\nThe former day; the next engaged in war).\nAs when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,\nThat bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful wings,\nWide o'er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;\nThen, gather'd, settles on the hoary deeps;\nThe afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar;\nThe waves behind impel the waves before,\nWide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:\nThus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,\nChief urged on chief, and man drove man along.\nFar o'er the plains, in dreadful order bright,\nThe brazen arms reflect a beamy light:\nFull in the blazing van great Hector shined,\nLike Mars commission'd to confound mankind.\nBefore him flaming his enormous shield,\nLike the broad sun, illumined all the field;\nHis nodding helm emits a streamy ray;\nHis piercing eyes through all the battle stray,\nAnd, while beneath his targe he flash'd along,\nShot terrors round, that wither'd e'en the strong.\nThus stalk'd he, dreadful; death was in his look:\nWhole nations fear'd; but not an Argive shook.\nThe towering Ajax, with an ample stride,\nAdvanced the first, and thus the chief defied:\n\"Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;\n'Tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering Jove we fear:\nThe skill of war to us not idly given,\nLo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.\nVain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,\nTo force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.\nLong ere in flames our lofty navy fall,\nYour boasted city, and your god-built wall,\nShall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;\nAnd spread a long unmeasured ruin round.\nThe time shall come, when, chased along the plain,\nEven thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;\nEven thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,\nThe wings of falcons for thy flying horse;\nShalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,\nWhile clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame.\"\nAs thus he spoke, behold, in open view,\nOn sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.\nTo Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise,\nAnd hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:\nFar-echoing clamours bound from side to side;",

The scene\nlies in the fields before Troy.\nOn the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,\nLies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.\nGreat Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,\nSprings to the front, and guards him from the foe.\nThus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,\nFruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;\nAnd anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)\nTurns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,\nOpposed to each that near the carcase came,\nHis broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.\nThe son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send,\nEyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.\n\"This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;\nWarrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:\nTo me the spoils my prowess won, resign:\nDepart with life, and leave the glory mine.\"\nThe Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd\nWith generous anguish, and in scorn return'd:\n\"Laugh'st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,\nWhen mortals boast of prowess not their own?\nNot thus the lion glories in his might,\nNor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,\nNor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)\nMan only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.\nBut far the vainest of the boastful kind,\nThese sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.\nYet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel\nThis boaster's brother, Hyperenor, fell;\nAgainst our arm which rashly he defied,\nVain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.\nThese eyes beheld him on the dust expire,\nNo more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.\nPresumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,\nGo, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;\nOr, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;\nFools stay to feel it, and are wise too late.\"\nUnmoved, Euphorbus thus: \"That action known,\nCome, for my brother's blood repay thy own.\nHis weeping father claims thy destined head,\nAnd spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.\nOn these thy conquer'd spoils I shall bestow,\nTo soothe a consort's and a parent's woe.\nNo longer then defer the glorious strife,\nLet heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life.\"\nSwift as the word the missile lance he flings;\nThe well-aim'd weapon on the buckler rings,\nBut blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.\nOn Jove the father great Atrides calls,\nNor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,\nIt pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;\nWide through the neck appears the grisly wound,\nProne sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.\nThe shining circlets of his golden hair,\nWhich even the Graces might be proud to wear,\nInstarr'd with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,\nWith dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.\nAs the young olive, in some sylvan scene,\nCrown'd by fresh fountains with eternal green,\nLifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,\nAnd plays and dances to the gentle air;\nWhen lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades\nThe tender plant, and withers all its shades;\nIt lies uprooted from its genial bed,\nA lovely ruin now defaced and dead:\nThus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,\nWhile the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.\nProud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,\nAffrighted Troy the towering victor flies:\nFlies, as before some mountain lion's ire\nThe village curs and trembling swains retire,\nWhen o'er the slaughter'd bull they hear him roar,\nAnd see his jaws distil with smoking gore:\nAll pale with fear, at distance scatter'd round,\nThey shout incessant, and the vales resound.\nMeanwhile Apollo view'd with envious eyes,\nAnd urged great Hector to dispute the prize;\n(In Mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care\nThe rough Ciconians learn'd the trade of war;)[247]\n\"Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase\nAchilles' coursers, of ethereal race;\nThey stoop not, these, to mortal man's command,\nOr stoop to none but great Achilles' hand.\nToo long amused with a pursuit so vain,\nTurn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;\nBy Sparta slain! for ever now suppress'd\nThe fire which burn'd in that undaunted breast!\"\nThus having spoke, Apollo wing'd his flight,\nAnd mix'd with mortals in the toils of fight:\nHis words infix'd unutterable care\nDeep in great Hector's soul: through all the war\nHe darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view'd\nThe breathless hero in his blood imbued,\n(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)\nAnd in the victor's hands the shining prey.\nSheath'd in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,\nAnd sends his voice in thunder to the skies:\nFierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,\nIt flew, and fired the nations as it went.\nAtrides from the voice the storm divined,\nAnd thus explored his own unconquer'd mind:\n\"Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,\nSlain in my cause, and for my honour slain!\nDesert the arms, the relics, of my friend?\nOr singly, Hector and his troops attend?\nSure where such partial favour heaven bestow'd,\nTo brave the hero were to brave the god:\nForgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;\n'Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.\nYet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,\nDid but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:\nStill would we turn, still battle on the plains,\nAnd give Achilles all that yet remains\nOf his and our Patroclus\u2014\" This, no more\nThe time allow'd: Troy thicken'd on the shore.",

in life's first bloom he fell,\nSent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.\nOnce more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies;\nThe Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,\nShunn'd the descending death; which hissing on,\nStretch'd in the dust the great Iphytus' son,\nSchedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind\nThe boldest warrior and the noblest mind:\nIn little Panope, for strength renown'd,\nHe held his seat, and ruled the realms around.\nPlunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,\nAnd deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;\nIn clanging arms the hero fell and all\nThe fields resounded with his weighty fall.\nPhorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,\nThe Telamonian lance his belly rends;\nThe hollow armour burst before the stroke,\nAnd through the wound the rushing entrails broke:\nIn strong convulsions panting on the sands\nHe lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.\nStruck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:\nThe shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.\nAnd now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,\nFled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;\nGreece, in her native fortitude elate,\nWith Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:\nBut Ph\u0153bus urged \u00c6neas to the fight;\nHe seem'd like aged Periphas to sight:\n(A herald in Anchises' love grown old,\nRevered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)\nThus he\u2014\"What methods yet, O chief! remain,\nTo save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?\nThere have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,\nBy valour, numbers, and by arts of war,\nHave forced the powers to spare a sinking state,\nAnd gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:\nBut you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares\nHis partial favour, and assists your wars,\nYour shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,\nAnd force the unwilling god to ruin Troy.\"\n\u00c6neas through the form assumed descries\nThe power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries:\n\"Oh lasting shame!

in place and fame.\nAsteropeus with grief beheld the slain,\nAnd rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain:\nIndissolubly firm, around the dead,\nRank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,\nAnd hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,\nA brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.\nGreat Ajax eyes them with incessant care,\nAnd in an orb contracts the crowded war,\nClose in their ranks commands to fight or fall,\nAnd stands the centre and the soul of all:\nFix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound;\nA sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:\nOn heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,\nAnd, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.\nGreece, in close order, and collected might,\nYet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;\nFierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,\nAnd now it rises, now it sinks by turns.\nIn one thick darkness all the fight was lost;\nThe sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host",

(said Hector, fired with stern disdain)\nWhat! coop whole armies in our walls again?\nWas't not enough, ye valiant warriors, say,\nNine years imprison'd in those towers ye lay?\nWide o'er the world was Ilion famed of old\nFor brass exhaustless, and for mines of gold:\nBut while inglorious in her walls we stay'd,\nSunk were her treasures, and her stores decay'd;\nThe Phrygians now her scatter'd spoils enjoy,\nAnd proud M\u00e6onia wastes the fruits of Troy.\nGreat Jove at length my arms to conquest calls,\nAnd shuts the Grecians in their wooden walls,\nDarest thou dispirit whom the gods incite?\nFlies any Trojan? I shall stop his flight.\nTo better counsel then attention lend;\nTake due refreshment, and the watch attend.\nIf there be one whose riches cost him care,\nForth let him bring them for the troops to share;\n'Tis better generously bestow'd on those,\nThan left the plunder of our country's foes.\nSoon as the morn the purple orient warms,\nFierce on yon navy will we pour our arms.\nIf great Achilles rise in all his might,\nHis be the danger: I shall stand the fight.\nHonour, ye gods! or let me gain or give;\nAnd live he glorious, whosoe'er shall live!\nMars is our common lord, alike to all;\nAnd oft the victor triumphs, but to fall.\"",

by Pallas and by Mars made bold:\nGold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,\nAnd gold their armour: these the squadron led,\nAugust, divine, superior by the head!\nA place for ambush fit they found, and stood,\nCover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.\nTwo spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem\nIf sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.\nSoon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,\nAnd steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;\nBehind them piping on their reeds they go,\nNor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.\nIn arms the glittering squadron rising round\nRush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;\nWhole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,\nAnd, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!\nThe bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;\nThey rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,\nThey fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;\nThe waving silver seem'd to blush with blood.\nThere Tumult, there Contention stood confess'd;\nOne rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast;\nOne held a living foe, that freshly bled\nWith new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead;\nNow here, now there, the carcases they tore:\nFate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.\nAnd the whole war came out, and met the eye;\nAnd each bold figure seem'd to live or die.\nA field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,[256]\nThe third time labour'd by the sweating hind;\nThe shining shares full many ploughmen guide,\nAnd turn their crooked yokes on every side.\nStill as at either end they wheel around,\nThe master meets them with his goblet crown'd;\nThe hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,\nThen back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:\nBehind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;\nAnd sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.\nAnother field rose high with waving grain;\nWith bended sickles stand the reaper train:\nHere stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,\nSheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.\nWith sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;\nThe gatherers follow, and collect in bands;\nAnd last the children, in whose arms are borne\n(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.\nThe rustic monarch of the field descries,\nWith silent glee, the heaps around him rise.\nA ready banquet on the turf is laid,\nBeneath an ample oak's expanded shade.\nThe victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;\nThe reaper's due repast, the woman's care.\nNext, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,\nBent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;\nA deeper dye the dangling clusters show,\nAnd curl'd on silver props, in order glow:\nA darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;\nAnd pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.\nTo this, one pathway gently winding leads,\nWhere march a train with baskets on their heads,\n(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear\nThe purple product of the autumnal year.\nTo these a youth awakes the warbling strings,\nWhose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;\nIn measured dance behind him move the train,\nTune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.\nHere herds of oxen march, erect and bold,\nRear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,\nAnd speed to meadows on whose sounding shores\nA rapid torrent through the rushes roars:\nFour golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,\nAnd nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.\nTwo lions rushing from the wood appear'd;\nAnd seized a bull, the master of the herd:\nHe roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;\nThey tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.\nThe dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,\nDread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.\nNext this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads\nDeep through fair forests, and a length of meads,\nAnd stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;\nAnd fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.\nA figured dance succeeds; such once was seen\nIn lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,\nForm'd by Daedalean art; a comely band\nOf youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.\nThe maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;\nThe youths all graceful in the glossy vest:\nOf those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;\nOf these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,\nThat glittering gay, from silver belts depend.\nNow all at once they rise, at once descend,\nWith well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,\nConfusedly regular, the moving maze:\nNow forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,\nAnd undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:\nSo whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,\nAnd, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.\nThe gazing multitudes admire around:\nTwo active tumblers in the centre bound;\nNow high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:\nAnd general songs the sprightly revel end.\nThus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd\nWith his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:\nIn living silver seem'd the waves to roll,\nAnd beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.\nThis done, whate'er a warrior's use requires\nHe forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,\nThe greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd\nWith various sculpture, and the golden crest.\nAt Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:\nShe, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,\nSwift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,",

with silence hear!\nAnd grant your monarch an impartial ear:\nAwhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,\nAnd let your rash, injurious clamours end:\nUnruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,\nWrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.\nNor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate:\nKnow, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate,\nWith fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day\nWhen from Achilles' arms I forced the prey.\nWhat then could I against the will of heaven?\nNot by myself, but vengeful Ate driven;\nShe, Jove's dread daughter, fated to infest\nThe race of mortals, enter'd in my breast.\nNot on the ground that haughty fury treads,\nBut prints her lofty footsteps on the heads\nOf mighty men; inflicting as she goes\nLong-festering wounds, inextricable woes!\nOf old, she stalk'd amid the bright abodes;\nAnd Jove himself, the sire of men and gods,\nThe world's great ruler, felt her venom'd dart;\nDeceived by Juno's wiles, and female art:\nFor when Alcmena's nine long months were run,\nAnd Jove expected his immortal son,\nTo gods and goddesses the unruly joy\nHe show'd, and vaunted of his matchless boy:\n'From us, (he said) this day an infant springs,\nFated to rule, and born a king of kings.'\nSaturnia ask'd an oath, to vouch the truth,\nAnd fix dominion on the favour'd youth.\nThe Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,\nPronounced those solemn words that bind a god.\nThe joyful goddess, from Olympus' height,\nSwift to Achaian Argos bent her flight:\nScarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus's wife;\nShe push'd her lingering infant into life:\nHer charms Alcmena's coming labours stay,\nAnd stop the babe, just issuing to the day.\nThen bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind;\n'A youth (said she) of Jove's immortal kind\nIs this day born: from Sthenelus he springs,\nAnd claims thy promise to be king of kings.'\nGrief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;\nStung to the soul, he sorrow'd, and he raged.\nFrom his ambrosial head, where perch'd she sate,\nHe snatch'd the fury-goddess of debate,\nThe dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,\nThe immortal seats should ne'er behold her more;\nAnd whirl'd her headlong down, for ever driven\nFrom bright Olympus and the starry heaven:\nThence on the nether world the fury fell;\nOrdain'd with man's contentious race to dwell.\nFull oft the god his son's hard toils bemoan'd,\nCursed the dire fury, and in secret groan'd.[258]\nEven thus, like Jove himself, was I misled,\nWhile raging Hector heap'd our camps with dead.\nWhat can the errors of my rage atone?\nMy martial troops, my treasures are thy own:\nThis instant from the navy shall be sent\nWhate'er Ulysses promised at thy tent:\nBut thou! appeased, propitious to our prayer,\nResume thy arms, and shine again in war.\"\n\"O king of nations! whose superior sway\n(Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey!\nTo keep or send the presents, be thy care;\nTo us, 'tis equal: all we ask is war.\nWhile yet we talk, or but an instant shun\nThe fight, our glorious work remains undone.\nLet every Greek, who sees my spear confound\nThe Trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,\nWith emulation, what I act survey,\nAnd learn from thence the business of the day.\"\nThe son of Peleus thus; and thus replies\nThe great in councils, Ithacus the wise:\n\"Though, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress'd,\nAt least our armies claim repast and rest:\nLong and laborious must the combat be,\nWhen by the gods inspired, and led by thee.\nStrength is derived from spirits and from blood,\nAnd those augment by generous wine and food:\nWhat boastful son of war, without that stay,\nCan last a hero through a single day?\nCourage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,\nMere unsupported man must yield at length;\nShrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,\nThe drooping body will desert the mind:\nBut built anew with strength-conferring fare,\nWith limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.\nDismiss the people, then, and give command,\nWith strong repast to hearten every band;\nBut let the presents to Achilles made,\nIn full assembly of all Greece be laid.\nThe king of men shall rise in public sight,\nAnd solemn swear (observant of the rite)\nThat, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,\nPure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.\nThat done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,\nAnd the full price of injured honour paid.\nStretch not henceforth, O prince! thy sovereign might\nBeyond the bounds of reason and of right;\n'Tis the chief praise that e'er to kings belong'd,\nTo right with justice whom with power they wrong'd.\"\nTo him the monarch: \"Just is thy decree,\nThy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.\nEach due atonement gladly I prepare;\nAnd heaven regard me as I justly swear!\nHere then awhile let Greece assembled stay,\nNor great Achilles grudge this short delay.\nTill from the fleet our presents be convey'd,\nAnd Jove attesting, the firm compact made.\nA train of noble youths the charge shall bear;\nThese to select, Ulysses, be thy care:\nIn order rank'd let all our gifts appear,\nAnd the fair train of captives close the rear:\nTalthybius shall the victim boar convey,\nSacred to Jove, and yon bright orb of day.\"\n\"For this (the stern \u00c6acides replies)\nSome less important season may suffice,\nWhen the stern fury of the war is o'er,\nAnd wrath, extinguish'd, burns my breast no more.\nBy Hector slain, their faces to the sky,\nAll grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie:\nThose call to war! and might my voice incite,\nNow, now, this instant, shall commence the fight:\nThen, when the day's complete, let generous bowls,\nAnd copious banquets, glad your weary souls.\nLet not my palate know the taste of food,\nTill my insatiate rage be cloy'd with blood:\nPale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o'er,\nAnd his cold feet are pointed to the door.\nRevenge is all my soul! no meaner care,\nInterest, or thought, has room to harbour there;\nDestruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,\nAnd scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds.\"\n\"O first of Greeks, (Ulysses thus rejoin'd,)\nThe best and bravest of the warrior kind!\nThy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,\nBut old experience and calm wisdom mine.\nThen hear my counsel, and to reason yield,\nThe bravest soon are satiate of the field;\nThough vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,\nThe bloody harvest brings but little gain:\nThe scale of conquest ever wavering lies,\nGreat Jove but turns it, and the victor dies!\nThe great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,\nAnd endless were the grief, to weep for all.\nEternal sorrows what avails to shed?\nGreece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:\nEnough, when death demands the brave, to pay\nThe tribute of a melancholy day.\nOne chief with patience to the grave resign'd,\nOur care devolves on others left behind.\nLet generous food supplies of strength produce,\nLet rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,\nLet their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,\nAnd pour new furies on the feebler foe.\nYet a short interval, and none shall dare\nExpect a second summons to the war;\nWho waits for that, the dire effects shall find,\nIf trembling in the ships he lags behind.\nEmbodied, to the battle let us bend,\nAnd all at once on haughty Troy descend.\"\nAnd now the delegates Ulysses sent,\nTo bear the presents from the royal tent:\nThe sons of Nestor, Phyleus' valiant heir,\nThias and Merion, thunderbolts of war,\nWith Lycomedes of Creiontian strain,\nAnd Melanippus, form'd the chosen train.\nSwift as the word was given, the youths obey'd:\nTwice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;\nA row of six fair tripods then succeeds;\nAnd twice the number of high-bounding steeds:\nSeven captives next a lovely line compose;\nThe eighth Brise\u00efs, like the blooming rose,\nClosed the bright band: great Ithacus, before,\nFirst of the train, the golden talents bore:\nThe rest in public view the chiefs dispose,\nA splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose:\nThe boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord\nDrew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword:\nThe stubborn bristles from the victim's brow\nHe crops, and offering meditates his vow.\nHis hands uplifted to the attesting skies,\nOn heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.\nThe solemn words a deep attention draw,\nAnd Greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.\n\"Witness thou first! thou greatest power above,\nAll-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!\nAnd mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,\nAnd ye, fell furies of the realms of night,\nWho rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare\nFor perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!\nThe black-eyed maid inviolate removes,\nPure and unconscious of my manly loves.\nIf this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,\nAnd levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!\"\nWith that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;\nThe bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;\nThe sacred herald rolls the victim slain\n(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.\nThen thus Achilles: \"Hear, ye Greeks! and know\nWhate'er we feel, 'tis Jove inflicts the woe;\nNot else Atrides could our rage inflame,\nNor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.\n'Twas Jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,\nThat doom'd our strife, and doom'd the Greeks to fall.\nGo then, ye chiefs!

The natives were content to till\nThe shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.[264]\nFrom Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,\nThe richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;\nThree thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,\nThree thousand foals beside their mothers fed.\nBoreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,\nConceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,\nWith voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,\nAnd coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:\nHence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,\nSwift as their mother mares, and father wind.\nThese lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,\nNor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;\nAnd when along the level seas they flew,[265]\nScarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.\nSuch Erichthonius was: from him there came\nThe sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.\nThree sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,\nIlus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:\nThe matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,\nWhom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,\nTo bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,\nThe grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).\nThe two remaining sons the line divide:\nFirst rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;\nFrom him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,\nAnd Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;\nClytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;\nAnd Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.\nFrom great Assaracus sprang Capys, he\nBegat Anchises, and Anchises me.\nSuch is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,\nBut Jove alone endues the soul with worth:\nHe, source of power and might! with boundless sway,\nAll human courage gives, or takes away.\nLong in the field of words we may contend,\nReproach is infinite, and knows no end,\nArm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;\nSo voluble a weapon is the tongue;\nWounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,\nFor every man has equal strength to rail:\nWomen alone, when in the streets they jar,\nPerhaps excel us in this wordy war;\nLike us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,\nAnd vent their anger impotent and loud.\nCease then\u2014Our business in the field of fight\nIs not to question, but to prove our might.\nTo all those insults thou hast offer'd here,\nReceive this answer: 'tis my flying spear.\"\nHe spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,\nFix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.\nFar on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held\n(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,\nThat trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear\nSaw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.\nHis fears were vain; impenetrable charms\nSecured the temper of the ethereal arms.\nThrough two strong plates the point its passage held,\nBut stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.\nFive plates of various metal, various mould,\nComposed the shield; of brass each outward fold,\nOf tin each inward, and the middle gold:\nThere stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,\nThe forceful spear of great Achilles flew,\nAnd pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,\nWhere the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:\nThrough the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,\nAnd the slight covering of expanded hides.\n\u00c6neas his contracted body bends,\nAnd o'er him high the riven targe extends,\nSees, through its parting plates, the upper air,\nAnd at his back perceives the quivering spear:\nA fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;\nAnd swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.\nAchilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,\nDraws his broad blade, and at \u00c6neas flies:\n\u00c6neas rousing as the foe came on,\nWith force collected, heaves a mighty stone:\nA mass enormous! which in modern days\nNo two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.\nBut ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground\nSaw the distress, and moved the powers around:\n\"Lo! on the brink of fate \u00c6neas stands,\nAn instant victim to Achilles' hands;\nBy Ph\u0153bus urged; but Ph\u0153bus has bestow'd\nHis aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.\nAnd can ye see this righteous chief atone\nWith guiltless blood for vices not his own?\nTo all the gods his constant vows were paid;\nSure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.\nFate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign\nThe future father of the Dardan line:[266]\nThe first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,\nAnd still his love descends on all the race:\nFor Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,\nAt length are odious to the all-seeing mind;\nOn great \u00c6neas shall devolve the reign,\nAnd sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain.\"\nThe great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies\nThe imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:\n\"Good as he is, to immolate or spare\nThe Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;\nPallas and I, by all that gods can bind,\nHave sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;\nNot even an instant to protract their fate,\nOr save one member of the sinking state;\nTill her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,\nAnd even her crumbling ruins are no more.\"\nThe king of ocean to the fight descends,\nThrough all the whistling darts his course he bends,\nSwift interposed between the warrior flies,\nAnd casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.[267]\nFrom great \u00c6neas' shield the spear he drew,\nAnd at his master's feet the weapon threw.\nThat done, with force divine he snatch'd on high\nThe Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,\nSmooth-gliding without step, above the heads\nOf warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:\nTill at the battle's utmost verge they light,\nWhere the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.\nThe godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)\nWith words like these the panting chief address'd:\n\"What power, O prince! with force inferior far,\nUrged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?\nHenceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,\nDefrauding fate of all thy fame to come.\nBut when the day decreed (for come it must)\nShall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,\nLet then the furies of that arm be known,\nSecure no Grecian force transcends thy own.\"\nWith that, he left him wondering as he lay,\nThen from Achilles chased the mist away:\nSudden, returning with a stream of light,\nThe scene of war came rushing on his sight.\nThen thus, amazed; \"What wonders strike my mind!\nMy spear, that parted on the wings of wind,\nLaid here before me! and the Dardan lord,\nThat fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!\nI thought alone with mortals to contend,\nBut powers celestial sure this foe defend.\nGreat as he is, our arms he scarce will try,\nContent for once, with all his gods, to fly.\nNow then let others bleed.\" This said, aloud\nHe vents his fury and inflames the crowd:\n\"O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)\nJoin battle, man to man, and arms to arms!\n'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,\nTo mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:\nNo god can singly such a host engage,\nNot Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.\nBut whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,\nWhate'er of active force, or acting fire;\nWhate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;\nAll, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.\nThrough yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,\nAnd thin the squadrons with my single spear.\"",

Achilles meets a shameful fate,\nOh how unworthy of the brave and great!\nLike some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,\nCrossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,\nAn unregarded carcase to the sea.\"\nNeptune and Pallas haste to his relief,\nAnd thus in human form address'd the chief:\nThe power of ocean first: \"Forbear thy fear,\nO son of Peleus!

\"Haste, my brother flood;\nAnd check this mortal that controls a god;\nOur bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,\nAnd Ilion tumble from her towery height.\nCall then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,\nFrom all thy fountains swell thy watery store,\nWith broken rocks, and with a load of dead,\nCharge the black surge, and pour it on his head.\nMark how resistless through the floods he goes,\nAnd boldly bids the warring gods be foes!\nBut nor that force, nor form divine to sight,\nShall aught avail him, if our rage unite:\nWhelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,\nThat blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;\nAnd deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,\nImmersed remain this terror of the world.\nSuch ponderous ruin shall confound the place,\nNo Greeks shall e'er his perish'd relics grace,\nNo hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;\nThese his cold rites, and this his watery tomb.\"\n[Illustration: ] ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS\nHe said; and on the chief descends amain,\nIncreased with gore, and swelling with the slain.\nThen, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,\nAnd a foam whitens on the purple waves:\nAt every step, before Achilles stood\nThe crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.\nFear touch'd the queen of heaven: she saw dismay'd,\nShe call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.\n\"Rise to the war! the insulting flood requires\nThy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!\nWhile to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,\nRush the swift eastern and the western wind:\nThese from old ocean at my word shall blow,\nPour the red torrent on the watery foe,\nCorses and arms to one bright ruin turn,\nAnd hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.\nGo, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,\nDrink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.\nScorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)\nExert the unwearied furies of the flame!\"\nThe power ignipotent her word obeys:\nWide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;\nAt once consumes the dead, and dries the soil\nAnd the shrunk waters in their channel boil.\nAs when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,\nAnd instant blows the water'd gardens dry:\nSo look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,\nWhile Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.\nSwift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;\nAlong the margin winds the running blaze:\nThe trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,\nThe flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,\nBroad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;\nThe watery willows hiss before the fire.\nNow glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,\nThe eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:\nNow flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,\nOr, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.\nAt length the river rear'd his languid head,\nAnd thus, short-panting, to the god he said:\n\"Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?\nI faint, I sink, unequal to the fight\u2014\nI yield\u2014Let Ilion fall; if fate decree\u2014\nAh\u2014bend no more thy fiery arms on me!\"\nHe ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;\nThe bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.\nAs when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,[272]\nTo melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,\nAmid the fierce embrace of circling fires\nThe waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:\nSo boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,\nAnd choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.\nTo Juno then, imperial queen of air,\nThe burning river sends his earnest prayer:\n\"Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage\nMe, only me, with all his wasteful rage?\nOn other gods his dreadful arm employ,\nFor mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.\nSubmissive I desist, if thou command;\nBut ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.\nHear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate\nUnaided Ilion, and her destined state,\nTill Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,\nAnd in one ruin sink the Trojan name.\"\nHis warm entreaty touch'd Saturnia's ear:\nShe bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,\nRecall the flame, nor in a mortal cause\nInfest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:\nAgain the branching streams begin to spread,\nAnd soft remurmur in their wonted bed.",

With feeble pace,\nAnd settled sorrow on his aged face,\nFast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;\nAnd thus descending, on the guards he calls:\n\"You to whose care our city-gates belong,\nSet wide your portals to the flying throng:\nFor lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;\nHe comes, and desolation marks his way!\nBut when within the walls our troops take breath,\nLock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death.\"\nThus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung\nThe opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.\nPh\u0153bus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;\nStruck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,\nOn heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,\nAnd gladsome see their last escape from fate.\nThither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,\nHoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:\nAnd gasping, panting, fainting, labour on\nWith heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.\nEnraged Achilles follows with his spear;\nWild with revenge, insatiable of war.\nThen had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,\nAnd Troy inglorious to her walls retired;\nBut he, the god who darts ethereal flame,\nShot down to save her, and redeem her fame:\nTo young Agenor force divine he gave;\n(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)\nIn aid of him, beside the beech he sate,\nAnd wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.\nWhen now the generous youth Achilles spies,\nThick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.\n(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)\nHe stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;\n\"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!\nLike others fly, and be like others slain?\nVain hope! to shun him by the self-same road\nYon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.\nNo: with the common heap I scorn to fall\u2014\nWhat if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,\nWhile I decline to yonder path, that leads\nTo Ida's forests and surrounding shades?\nSo may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,\nFrom my tired body wash the dirt and blood,\nAs soon as night her dusky veil extends,\nReturn in safety to my Trojan friends.\nWhat if?\u2014But wherefore all this vain debate?\nStand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?\nEven now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,\nThe fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:\nSuch is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,\nAnd such his valour, that who stands must die.\nHowe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,\nHere, and in public view, to meet my fate.\nYet sure he too is mortal; he may feel\n(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.\nOne only soul informs that dreadful frame:\nAnd Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame.\"\nHe said, and stood, collected, in his might;\nAnd all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.\nSo from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,\nRoused from his thicket by a storm of darts:\nUntaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds\nOf shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;\nThough struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;\nAnd the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:\nOn their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;\nAnd tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.\nNot less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir\nConfronts Achilles, and awaits the war,\nDisdainful of retreat: high held before,\nHis shield (a broad circumference) he bore;\nThen graceful as he stood, in act to throw\nThe lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:\n\"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!\nAnd hopes this day to sink the Trojan name\nBeneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;\nA thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.\nParents and children our just arms employ,\nAnd strong and many are the sons of Troy.\nGreat as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore\nThese Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore.\"\nHe said: with matchless force the javelin flung\nSmote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung\nBeneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms\nHe stands impassive in the ethereal arms.\nThen fiercely rushing on the daring foe,\nHis lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:\nBut, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds\nThe god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.\nSafe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,\nDismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.\nMeanwhile the god, to cover their escape,\nAssumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,\nFlies from the furious chief in this disguise;\nThe furious chief still follows where he flies.\nNow o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,\nNow urge the course where swift Scamander glides:\nThe god, now distant scarce a stride before,\nTempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;\nWhile all the flying troops their speed employ,\nAnd pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:\nNo stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,\nWho 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.\n'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;\nAnd sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.\nPale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:",

Then wept the sage:\nHe strikes his reverend head, now white with age;\nHe lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;\nHe calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:\nThe son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,\nFull at the Sc\u00e6an gates expects the war;\nWhile the sad father on the rampart stands,\nAnd thus adjures him with extended hands:\n\"Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;\nHector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!\nMethinks already I behold thee slain,\nAnd stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.\nImplacable Achilles! might'st thou be\nTo all the gods no dearer than to me!\nThee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore,\nAnd bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.\nHow many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,\nValiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:\nOr, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles\nTo shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.\nTwo, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,\nTwo from one mother sprung, my Polydore,\nAnd loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!\nOh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,\nWhat heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!\n(Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,\nConsign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)\nBut if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,\nAll pale they wander on the Stygian coast;\nWhat sorrows then must their sad mother know,\nWhat anguish I? unutterable woe!\nYet less that anguish, less to her, to me,\nLess to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.\nYet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;\nAnd spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!\nSave thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave\nNeglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.\nPity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;\nWhile yet thy father feels the woes he bears,\nYet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage\n(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)\nGreat Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!\nThe bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:\nTo fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,\nAnd number all his days by miseries!\nMy heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,\nMy daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,\nMy bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;\nThese I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!\nPerhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,\nThe last sad relic of my ruin'd state,\n(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,\nAnd stain the pavement of my regal hall;\nWhere famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,\nShall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.\nYet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;\nWell have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.\nWho dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,\nStruck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.\nBut when the fates, in fulness of their rage,\nSpurn the hoar head of unresisting age,\nIn dust the reverend lineaments deform,\nAnd pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:\nThis, this is misery! the last, the worse,\nThat man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!\"\nHe said, and acting what no words could say,\nRent from his head the silver locks away.\nWith him the mournful mother bears a part;\nYet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.\nThe zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;\nAnd thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:\n\"Have mercy on me, O my son! revere\nThe words of age; attend a parent's prayer!\nIf ever thee in these fond arms I press'd,\nOr still'd thy infant clamours at this breast;\nAh do not thus our helpless years forego,\nBut, by our walls secured, repel the foe.\nAgainst his rage if singly thou proceed,\nShould'st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should'st thou bleed,\nNor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,\nNor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!\nFar from our pious rites those dear remains\nMust feast the vultures on the naked plains.\"\nSo they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;\nBut fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;\nResolved he stands, and with a fiery glance\nExpects the hero's terrible advance.\nSo, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake\nBeholds the traveller approach the brake;\nWhen fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins\nHave gather'd half the poisons of the plains;\nHe burns, he stiffens with collected ire,\nAnd his red eyeballs glare with living fire.\nBeneath a turret, on his shield reclined,\nHe stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:[275]\n\"Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?\nHonour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:\nShall proud Polydamas before the gate\nProclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,\nWhich timely follow'd but the former night,\nWhat numbers had been saved by Hector's flight?\nThat wise advice rejected with disdain,\nI feel my folly in my people slain.\nMethinks my suffering country's voice I hear,\nBut most her worthless sons insult my ear,\nOn my rash courage charge the chance of war,\nAnd blame those virtues which they cannot share.\nNo\u2014if I e'er return, return I must\nGlorious, my country's terror laid in dust:\nOr if I perish, let her see me fall\nIn field at least, and fighting for her wall.\nAnd yet suppose these measures I forego,\nApproach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,\nThe warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down,\nAnd treat on terms of peace to save the town:\nThe wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd\n(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)\nWith honourable justice to restore:\nAnd add half Ilion's yet remaining store,\nWhich Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece\nMay share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.\nBut why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,\nWhat hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,\nBut woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?\nWe greet not here, as man conversing man,\nMet at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;\nNo season now for calm familiar talk,\nLike youths and maidens in an evening walk:\nWar is our business, but to whom is given\nTo die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!\"\nThus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;\nHis dreadful plumage nodded from on high;\nThe Pelian javelin, in his better hand,\nShot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;\nAnd on his breast the beamy splendour shone,\nLike Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.\nAs Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,\nStruck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.\nHe leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:\nAchilles follows like the winged wind.\nThus at the panting dove a falcon flies\n(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),\nJust when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,\nObliquely wheeling through the aerial way,\nWith open beak and shrilling cries he springs,\nAnd aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:\nNo less fore-right the rapid chase they held,\nOne urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:\nNow circling round the walls their course maintain,\nWhere the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;\nNow where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,\n(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.\nNext by Scamander's double source they bound,\nWhere two famed fountains burst the parted ground;\nThis hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,\nWith exhalations steaming to the skies;\nThat the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,\nLike crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:\nEach gushing fount a marble cistern fills,\nWhose polish'd bed receives the falling rills;\nWhere Trojan dames (ere yet alarm'd by Greece)\nWash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.[276]\nBy these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight:\n(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)\nSwift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,\nNo vulgar victim must reward the day:\n(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)\nThe prize contended was great Hector's life.",

The silence Hector broke:\nHis dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:\n\"Enough, O son of Peleus!

decreed\nTo the brave rulers of the racing steed;\nPrizes which none beside ourself could gain,\nShould our immortal coursers take the plain;\n(A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god\nPeleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)\nBut this no time our vigour to display;\nNor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:\nLost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck\nTheir flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.\nSad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,\nAnd trail those graceful honours on the sand!\nLet others for the noble task prepare,\nWho trust the courser and the flying car.\"\nFired at his word the rival racers rise;\nBut far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,\nFamed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,\nAnd skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.\nWith equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd,\nThe steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell'd\n(Which late obey'd the Dardan chief's command,\nWhen scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand).\nThen Menelaus his Podargus brings,\nAnd the famed courser of the king of kings:\nWhom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),\nTo 'scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,\n(\u00c6the her name) at home to end his days;\nBase wealth preferring to eternal praise.\nNext him Antilochus demands the course\nWith beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.\nExperienced Nestor gives his son the reins,\nDirects his judgment, and his heat restrains;\nNor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears\nThe prudent son with unattending ears.\n\"My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,\nThe gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd;\nNeptune and Jove on thee conferr'd the skill\nSwift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.\nTo guide thy conduct little precept needs;\nBut slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.\nFear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;\nCompare those rivals' judgment and thy own:\nIt is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,\nAnd to be swift is less than to be wise.\n'Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes\nThe dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;\nBy art the pilot, through the boiling deep\nAnd howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;\nAnd 'tis the artist wins the glorious course;\nNot those who trust in chariots and in horse.\nIn vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,\nAnd short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive:\nWhile with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,\nThe knowing racer to his end proceeds;\nFix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,\nHis hand unerring steers the steady horse,\nAnd now contracts, or now extends the rein,\nObserving still the foremost on the plain.\nMark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;\nYon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;\nOf some once stately oak the last remains,\nOr hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:\nInclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;\nAnd round, a circle for the wheeling car.\n(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;\nOr then, as now, the limit of a race.)\nBear close to this, and warily proceed,\nA little bending to the left-hand steed;\nBut urge the right, and give him all the reins;\nWhile thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,\nAnd turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,\nThe wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.\nYet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)\nClear of the stony heap direct the course;\nLest through incaution failing, thou mayst be\nA joy to others, a reproach to me.\nSo shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,\nAnd leave unskilful swiftness far behind:\nThough thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed\nWhich bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;\nOr the famed race, through all the regions known,\nThat whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon.\"\nThus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage\nConcludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.\nNext bold Meriones was seen to rise,\nThe last, but not least ardent for the prize.\nThey mount their seats; the lots their place dispose\n(Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).\nYoung Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;\nAnd next the brother of the king of men:\nThy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;\nAnd, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.\nThey stand in order, an impatient train:\nPelides points the barrier on the plain,\nAnd sends before old Ph\u0153nix to the place,\nTo mark the racers, and to judge the race.\nAt once the coursers from the barrier bound;\nThe lifted scourges all at once resound;\nTheir heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;\nAnd up the champaign thunder from the shore:\nThick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,\nAnd the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;\nLoose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,\nFloat in their speed, and dance upon the wind:\nThe smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,\nNow seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.\nWhile hot for fame, and conquest all their care,\n(Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)\nErect with ardour, poised upon the rein,\nThey pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.\nNow (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)\nAt the near prize each gathers all his soul,\nEach burns with double hope, with double pain,\nTears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.\nFirst flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;\nWith those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:\nClose on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,\nAnd seem just mounting on his car behind;\nFull on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,\nAnd, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.\nThen had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;\nBut angry Ph\u0153bus to Tydides flies,\nStrikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain\nHis matchless horses' labour on the plain.\nRage fills his eye with anguish, to survey\nSnatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.\nThe fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,\nSprings to her knight, and gives the scourge again,\nAnd fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke\nShe breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:\nNo more their way the startled horses held;\nThe car reversed came rattling on the field;\nShot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,\nProne on the dust the unhappy master fell;\nHis batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;\nNose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:\nGrief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:\nBefore him far the glad Tydides flies;\nMinerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,\nAnd crowns him victor of the labour'd race.\nThe next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;\nWhile thus young Nestor animates his steeds:\n\"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;\nNot that we hope to match Tydides' horse,\nSince great Minerva wings their rapid way,\nAnd gives their lord the honours of the day;\nBut reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo\nYour swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?\nThrough your neglect, if lagging on the plain\nThe last ignoble gift be all we gain,\nNo more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,\nThe old man's fury rises, and ye die.\nHaste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,\nPresents the occasion, could we use it right.\"\nThus he. The coursers at their master's threat\nWith quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.\nAnd now Antilochus with nice survey\nObserves the compass of the hollow way.\n'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,\nFast by the road a precipice was worn:\nHere, where but one could pass, to shun the throng\nThe Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.\nClose up the venturous youth resolves to keep,\nStill edging near, and bears him toward the steep.\nAtrides, trembling, casts his eye below,\nAnd wonders at the rashness of his foe.\n\"Hold, stay your steeds\u2014What madness thus to ride\nThis narrow way! take larger field (he cried),\nOr both must fall.\"\u2014Atrides cried in vain;\nHe flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.\nFar as an able arm the disk can send,\nWhen youthful rivals their full force extend,\nSo far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew\nBefore the king: he, cautious, backward drew\nHis horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears\nThe rattling ruin of the clashing cars,\nThe floundering coursers rolling on the plain,\nAnd conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.\nBut thus upbraids his rival as he flies:\n\"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!\nGo, but expect not I'll the prize resign;\nAdd perjury to fraud, and make it thine\u2014\"\nThen to his steeds with all his force he cries,\n\"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!\nYour rivals, destitute of youthful force,\nWith fainting knees shall labour in the course,\nAnd yield the glory yours.\"\u2014The steeds obey;\nAlready at their heels they wing their way,\nAnd seem already to retrieve the day.\nMeantime the Grecians in a ring beheld\nThe coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.\nThe first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;\nHigh on a rising ground, above the ring,\nThe monarch sat: from whence with sure survey\nHe well observed the chief who led the way,\nAnd heard from far his animating cries,\nAnd saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;\nOn whose broad front a blaze of shining white,\nLike the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.\nHe saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:\n\"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?\nOr can ye, all, another chief survey,\nAnd other steeds than lately led the way?\nThose, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,\nLie sure disabled in the middle field:\nFor, since the goal they doubled, round the plain\nI search to find them, but I search in vain.\nPerchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,\nAnd, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,\nShot from the chariot; while his coursers stray\nWith frantic fury from the destined way.\nRise then some other, and inform my sight,\nFor these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;\nYet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,\nThe great \u00c6tolian chief, renown'd in war.\"\n\"Old man! (O\u00efleus rashly thus replies)\nThy tongue too hastily confers the prize;\nOf those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,\nNor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.\nEumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,\nStill, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:\nI well discern him, as he shakes the rein,\nAnd hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain.\"\nThus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:\n\"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!\nContentious prince, of all the Greeks beside\nThe last in merit, as the first in pride!\nTo vile reproach what answer can we make?\nA goblet or a tripod let us stake,\nAnd be the king the judge. The most unwise\nWill learn their rashness, when they pay the price.\"\nHe said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,\nStern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn\nTo fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son\nAwful amidst them rose, and thus begun:\n\"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;\nMuch would ye blame, should others thus offend:\nAnd lo! the approaching steeds your contest end.\"\nNo sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,\nDrives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.\nHigh o'er his head the circling lash he wields:\nHis bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:\nHis car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,\nBright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,\nRefulgent through the cloud: no eye could find\nThe track his flying wheels had left behind:\nAnd the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace\nSo swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.\nNow victor at the goal Tydides stands,\nQuits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;\nFrom the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;\nThe well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:\nWith joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,\nThe tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:\nThese to the ships his train triumphant leads,\nThe chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.\nYoung Nestor follows (who by art, not force,\nO'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.\nBehind, Atrides urged the race, more near\nThan to the courser in his swift career\nThe following car, just touching with his heel\nAnd brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:\nSuch, and so narrow now the space between\nThe rivals, late so distant on the green;\nSo soon swift \u00c6the her lost ground regain'd,\nOne length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.\nMerion pursued, at greater distance still,",

thou tread'st on hostile land;\nRelease my knees, thy suppliant arts give o'er,\nAnd shake the purpose of my soul no more.\"\nThe sire obey'd him, trembling and o'eraw'd.\nAchilles, like a lion, rush'd abroad:\nAutomedon and Alcimus attend,\n(Whom most he honour'd, since he lost his friend,)\nThese to unyoke the mules and horses went,\nAnd led the hoary herald to the tent;\nNext, heap'd on high, the numerous presents bear,\n(Great Hector's ransom,) from the polish'd car.\nTwo splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,\nThey leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.\nThen call the handmaids, with assistant toil\nTo wash the body and anoint with oil,\nApart from Priam: lest the unhappy sire,\nProvoked to passion, once more rouse to ire\nThe stern Pelides; and nor sacred age,\nNor Jove's command, should check the rising rage.\nThis done, the garments o'er the corse they spread;\nAchilles lifts it to the funeral bed:\nThen, while the body on the car they laid,\nHe groans, and calls on loved Patroclus' shade:\n\"If, in that gloom which never light must know,\nThe deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,\nO friend! forgive me, that I thus fulfil\n(Restoring Hector) heaven's unquestion'd will.\nThe gifts the father gave, be ever thine,\nTo grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine.\"[296]\nHe said, and, entering, took his seat of state;\nWhere full before him reverend Priam sate;\nTo whom, composed, the godlike chief begun:\n\"Lo! to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son;\nExtended on the funeral couch he lies;\nAnd soon as morning paints the eastern skies,\nThe sight is granted to thy longing eyes:\nBut now the peaceful hours of sacred night\nDemand reflection, and to rest invite:\nNor thou, O father! thus consumed with woe,\nThe common cares that nourish life forego.\nNot thus did Niobe, of form divine,\nA parent once, whose sorrows equall'd thine:\nSix youthful sons, as many blooming maids,\nIn one sad day beheld the Stygian shades;\nThose by Apollo's silver bow were slain,\nThese, Cynthia's arrows stretch'd upon the plain:\nSo was her pride chastised by wrath divine,\nWho match'd her own with bright Latona's line;\nBut two the goddess, twelve the queen enjoy'd;\nThose boasted twelve, the avenging two destroy'd.\nSteep'd in their blood, and in the dust outspread,\nNine days, neglected, lay exposed the dead;\nNone by to weep them, to inhume them none;\n(For Jove had turn'd the nation all to stone.)\nThe gods themselves, at length relenting gave\nThe unhappy race the honours of a grave.\nHerself a rock (for such was heaven's high will)\nThrough deserts wild now pours a weeping rill;\nWhere round the bed whence Achelous springs,\nThe watery fairies dance in mazy rings;\nThere high on Sipylus's shaggy brow,\nShe stands, her own sad monument of woe;\nThe rock for ever lasts, the tears for ever flow.\n\"Such griefs, O king! have other parents known;\nRemember theirs, and mitigate thy own.\nThe care of heaven thy Hector has appear'd,\nNor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr'd;\nSoon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown'd,\nAnd all the eyes of Ilion stream around.\"\nHe said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe\nWith silver fleece, which his attendants slew.\nThe limbs they sever from the reeking hide,\nWith skill prepare them, and in parts divide:\nEach on the coals the separate morsels lays,\nAnd, hasty, snatches from the rising blaze.\nWith bread the glittering canisters they load,\nWhich round the board Automedon bestow'd.\nThe chief himself to each his portion placed,\nAnd each indulging shared in sweet repast.\nWhen now the rage of hunger was repress'd,\nThe wondering hero eyes his royal guest:\nNo less the royal guest the hero eyes,\nHis godlike aspect and majestic size;\nHere, youthful grace and noble fire engage;\nAnd there, the mild benevolence of age.\nThus gazing long, the silence neither broke,\n(A solemn scene!) at length the father spoke:\n\"Permit me now, beloved of Jove! to steep\nMy careful temples in the dew of sleep:\nFor, since the day that number'd with the dead\nMy hapless son, the dust has been my bed;\nSoft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;\nMy only food, my sorrows and my sighs!\nTill now, encouraged by the grace you give,\nI share thy banquet, and consent to live.\"\nWith that, Achilles bade prepare the bed,\nWith purple soft and shaggy carpets spread;\nForth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,\nAnd place the couches, and the coverings lay.\nThen he: \"Now, father, sleep, but sleep not here;\nConsult thy safety, and forgive my fear,\nLest any Argive, at this hour awake,\nTo ask our counsel, or our orders take,\nApproaching sudden to our open'd tent,\nPerchance behold thee, and our grace prevent.\nShould such report thy honour'd person here,\nThe king of men the ransom might defer;\nBut say with speed, if aught of thy desire\nRemains unask'd; what time the rites require\nTo inter thy Hector? For, so long we stay\nOur slaughtering arm, and bid the hosts obey.\"\n\"If then thy will permit (the monarch said)\nTo finish all due honours to the dead,\nThis of thy grace accord: to thee are known\nThe fears of Ilion, closed within her town;\nAnd at what distance from our walls aspire\nThe hills of Ide, and forests for the fire.\nNine days to vent our sorrows I request,\nThe tenth shall see the funeral and the feast;\nThe next, to raise his monument be given;\nThe twelfth we war, if war be doom'd by heaven!\"\n\"This thy request (replied the chief) enjoy:\nTill then our arms suspend the fall of Troy.\"\nThen gave his hand at parting, to prevent\nThe old man's fears, and turn'd within the tent;\nWhere fair Brise\u00efs, bright in blooming charms,\nExpects her hero with desiring arms.\nBut in the porch the king and herald rest;\nSad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast.\nNow gods and men the gifts of sleep partake;\nIndustrious Hermes only was awake,\nThe king's return revolving in his mind,\nTo pass the ramparts, and the watch to blind.\nThe power descending hover'd o'er his head:\n\"And sleep'st thou, father! (thus the vision said:)\nNow dost thou sleep, when Hector is restored?\nNor fear the Grecian foes, or Grecian lord?\nThy presence here should stern Atrides see,\nThy still surviving sons may sue for thee;\nMay offer all thy treasures yet contain,\nTo spare thy age; and offer all in vain.\"\nWaked with the word the trembling sire arose,\nAnd raised his friend: the god before him goes:\nHe joins the mules, directs them with his hand,\nAnd moves in silence through the hostile land.\nWhen now to Xanthus' yellow stream they drove,\n(Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove,)\nThe winged deity forsook their view,\nAnd in a moment to Olympus flew.\nNow shed Aurora round her saffron ray,\nSprang through the gates of light, and gave the day:\nCharged with the mournful load, to Ilion go\nThe sage and king, majestically slow.\nCassandra first beholds, from Ilion's spire,\nThe sad procession of her hoary sire;\nThen, as the pensive pomp advanced more near,\n(Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,)\nA shower of tears o'erflows her beauteous eyes,\nAlarming thus all Ilion with her cries:\n\"Turn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,\nYe wretched daughters, and ye sons of Troy!\nIf e'er ye rush'd in crowds, with vast delight,\nTo hail your hero glorious from the fight,\nNow meet him dead, and let your sorrows flow;\nYour common triumph, and your common woe.\"\nIn thronging crowds they issue to the plains;\nNor man nor woman in the walls remains;\nIn every face the self-same grief is shown;\nAnd Troy sends forth one universal groan.\nAt Sc\u00e6a's gates they meet the mourning wain,\nHang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.\nThe wife and mother, frantic with despair,\nKiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter'd hair:\nThus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay;\nAnd there had sigh'd and sorrow'd out the day;\nBut godlike Priam from the chariot rose:\n\"Forbear (he cried) this violence of woes;\nFirst to the palace let the car proceed,\nThen pour your boundless sorrows o'er the dead.\"\nThe waves of people at his word divide,\nSlow rolls the chariot through the following tide;\nEven to the palace the sad pomp they wait:\nThey weep, and place him on the bed of state.\nA melancholy choir attend around,\nWith plaintive sighs, and music's solemn sound:\nAlternately they sing, alternate flow\nThe obedient tears, melodious in their woe.\nWhile deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,\nAnd nature speaks at every pause of art.\nFirst to the corse the weeping consort flew;\nAround his neck her milk-white arms she threw,\n\"And oh, my Hector!

(she cries)\nSnatch'd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!\nThou to the dismal realms for ever gone!\nAnd I abandon'd, desolate, alone!\nAn only son, once comfort of our pains,\nSad product now of hapless love, remains!\nNever to manly age that son shall rise,\nOr with increasing graces glad my eyes:\nFor Ilion now (her great defender slain)\nShall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.\nWho now protects her wives with guardian care?\nWho saves her infants from the rage of war?\nNow hostile fleets must waft those infants o'er\n(Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:\nThou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,\nThe sad companion of thy mother's woe;\nDriven hence a slave before the victor's sword\nCondemn'd to toil for some inhuman lord:\nOr else some Greek whose father press'd the plain,\nOr son, or brother, by great Hector slain,\nIn Hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,\nAnd hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.[297]\nFor thy stern father never spared a foe:\nThence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!\nThence many evils his sad parents bore,\nHis parents many, but his consort more.\nWhy gav'st thou not to me thy dying hand?\nAnd why received not I thy last command?\nSome word thou would'st have spoke, which, sadly dear,\nMy soul might keep, or utter with a tear;\nWhich never, never could be lost in air,\nFix'd in my heart, and oft repeated there!\"\nThus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,\nHer weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.\nThe mournful mother next sustains her part:\n\"O thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!\nOf all my race thou most by heaven approved,\nAnd by the immortals even in death beloved!\nWhile all my other sons in barbarous bands\nAchilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,\nThis felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,\nFree, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.\nSentenced, 'tis true, by his inhuman doom,\nThy noble corse was dragg'd around the tomb;\n(The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)\nUngenerous insult, impotent and vain!\nYet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace;\nNo mark of pain, or violence of face:\nRosy and fair! as Ph\u0153bus' silver bow\nDismiss'd thee gently to the shades below.\"\nThus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.\nSad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;\nFast from the shining sluices of her eyes\nFall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.\n\"Ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join'd[298]\nThe mildest manners with the bravest mind,\nNow twice ten years (unhappy years) are o'er\nSince Paris brought me to the Trojan shore,\n(O had I perish'd, ere that form divine\nSeduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)\nYet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find\nA deed ungentle, or a word unkind.\nWhen others cursed the authoress of their woe,\nThy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.\nIf some proud brother eyed me with disdain,\nOr scornful sister with her sweeping train,\nThy gentle accents soften'd all my pain.\nFor thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,\nThe wretched source of all this misery.\nThe fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;\nSad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!\nThrough Troy's wide streets abandon'd shall I roam!\nIn Troy deserted, as abhorr'd at home!\"\nSo spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.\nDistressful beauty melts each stander-by.\nOn all around the infectious sorrow grows;\nBut Priam check'd the torrent as it rose:\n\"Perform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,\nAnd fell the forests for a funeral pyre;\nTwelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;\nAchilles grants these honours to the dead.\"[299]\n[Illustration: ] FUNERAL OF HECTOR\nHe spoke, and, at his word, the Trojan train\nTheir mules and oxen harness to the wain,\nPour through the gates, and fell'd from Ida's crown,\nRoll back the gather'd forests to the town.\nThese toils continue nine succeeding days,\nAnd high in air a sylvan structure raise.\nBut when the tenth fair morn began to shine,\nForth to the pile was borne the man divine,\nAnd placed aloft; while all, with streaming eyes,\nBeheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.\nSoon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,\nWith rosy lustre streak'd the dewy lawn,\nAgain the mournful crowds surround the pyre,\nAnd quench with wine the yet remaining fire.\nThe snowy bones his friends and brothers place\n(With tears collected) in a golden vase;\nThe golden vase in purple palls they roll'd,\nOf softest texture, and inwrought with gold.\nLast o'er the urn the sacred earth they spread,\nAnd raised the tomb, memorial of the dead.\n(Strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,\nWatch'd from the rising to the setting sun.)\nAll Troy then moves to Priam's court again,\nA solemn, silent, melancholy train:\nAssembled there, from pious toil they rest,\nAnd sadly shared the last sepulchral feast.\nSuch honours Ilion to her hero paid,\nAnd peaceful slept the mighty Hector's shade.",
