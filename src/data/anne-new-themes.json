            "text": "MRS. Rachel Lynde lived just where the Avonlea main road dipped down\ninto a little hollow, fringed with alders and ladies' eardrops and\ntraversed by a brook that had its source away back in the woods of the\nold Cuthbert place; it was reputed to be an intricate, headlong brook\nin its earlier course through those woods, with dark secrets of pool\nand cascade; but by the time it reached Lynde's Hollow it was a quiet,\nwell-conducted little stream, for not even a brook could run past Mrs.\nRachel Lynde's door without due regard for decency and decorum; it\nprobably was conscious that Mrs. Rachel was sitting at her window,\nkeeping a sharp eye on everything that passed, from brooks and children\nup, and that if she noticed anything odd or out of place she would never\nrest until she had ferreted out the whys and wherefores thereof.\nThere are plenty of people in Avonlea and out of it, who can attend\nclosely to their neighbor's business by dint of neglecting their own;\nbut Mrs. Rachel Lynde was one of those capable creatures who can manage\ntheir own concerns and those of other folks into the bargain. She was a\nnotable housewife; her work was always done and well done; she \"ran\" the\nSewing Circle, helped run the Sunday-school, and was the strongest prop\nof the Church Aid Society and Foreign Missions Auxiliary. Yet with all\nthis Mrs. Rachel found abundant time to sit for hours at her kitchen\nwindow, knitting \"cotton warp\" quilts--she had knitted sixteen of them,\nas Avonlea housekeepers were wont to tell in awed voices--and keeping\na sharp eye on the main road that crossed the hollow and wound up\nthe steep red hill beyond. Since Avonlea occupied a little triangular\npeninsula jutting out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence with water on two\nsides of it, anybody who went out of it or into it had to pass over that\nhill road and so run the unseen gauntlet of Mrs. Rachel's all-seeing\neye.\nShe was sitting there one afternoon in early June. The sun was coming in\nat the window warm and bright; the orchard on the slope below the house\nwas in a bridal flush of pinky-white bloom, hummed over by a myriad of\nbees. Thomas Lynde--a meek little man whom Avonlea people called \"Rachel\nLynde's husband\"--was sowing his late turnip seed on the hill field\nbeyond the barn; and Matthew Cuthbert ought to have been sowing his on\nthe big red brook field away over by Green Gables. Mrs. Rachel knew\nthat he ought because she had heard him tell Peter Morrison the evening\nbefore in William J. Blair's store over at Carmody that he meant to sow\nhis turnip seed the next afternoon. Peter had asked him, of course, for\nMatthew Cuthbert had never been known to volunteer information about\nanything in his whole life.\nAnd yet here was Matthew Cuthbert, at half-past three on the afternoon\nof a busy day, placidly driving over the hollow and up the hill;\nmoreover, he wore a white collar and his best suit of clothes, which was\nplain proof that he was going out of Avonlea; and he had the buggy\nand the sorrel mare, which betokened that he was going a considerable\ndistance. Now, where was Matthew Cuthbert going and why was he going\nthere?\nHad it been any other man in Avonlea, Mrs. Rachel, deftly putting this\nand that together, might have given a pretty good guess as to both\nquestions. But Matthew so rarely went from home that it must be\nsomething pressing and unusual which was taking him; he was the shyest\nman alive and hated to have to go among strangers or to any place where\nhe might have to talk. Matthew, dressed up with a white collar and\ndriving in a buggy, was something that didn't happen often. Mrs. Rachel,\nponder as she might, could make nothing of it and her afternoon's\nenjoyment was spoiled.\n\"I'll just step over to Green Gables after tea and find out from Marilla\nwhere he's gone and why,\" the worthy woman finally concluded. \"He\ndoesn't generally go to town this time of year and he _never_ visits; if\nhe'd run out of turnip seed he wouldn't dress up and take the buggy to\ngo for more; he wasn't driving fast enough to be going for a doctor.\nYet something must have happened since last night to start him off. I'm\nclean puzzled, that's what, and I won't know a minute's peace of mind or\nconscience until I know what has taken Matthew Cuthbert out of Avonlea\ntoday.\"",

One could\nhave eaten a meal off the ground without over-brimming the proverbial\npeck of dirt.\nMrs. Rachel rapped smartly at the kitchen door and stepped in\nwhen bidden to do so. The kitchen at Green Gables was a cheerful\napartment--or would have been cheerful if it had not been so painfully\nclean as to give it something of the appearance of an unused parlor. Its\nwindows looked east and west; through the west one, looking out on\nthe back yard, came a flood of mellow June sunlight; but the east one,\nwhence you got a glimpse of the bloom white cherry-trees in the left\norchard and nodding, slender birches down in the hollow by the brook,\nwas greened over by a tangle of vines. Here sat Marilla Cuthbert, when\nshe sat at all, always slightly distrustful of sunshine, which seemed to\nher too dancing and irresponsible a thing for a world which was meant to\nbe taken seriously; and here she sat now, knitting, and the table behind\nher was laid for supper.\nMrs. Rachel, before she had fairly closed the door, had taken a mental\nnote of everything that was on that table. There were three plates laid,\nso that Marilla must be expecting some one home with Matthew to tea; but\nthe dishes were everyday dishes and there was only crab-apple preserves\nand one kind of cake, so that the expected company could not be any\nparticular company. Yet what of Matthew's white collar and the sorrel\nmare? Mrs. Rachel was getting fairly dizzy with this unusual mystery\nabout quiet, unmysterious Green Gables.\n\"Good evening, Rachel,\" Marilla said briskly. \"This is a real fine\nevening, isn't it? Won't you sit down? How are all your folks?\"\nSomething that for lack of any other name might be called friendship\nexisted and always had existed between Marilla Cuthbert and Mrs. Rachel,\nin spite of--or perhaps because of--their dissimilarity.\nMarilla was a tall, thin woman, with angles and without curves; her dark\nhair showed some gray streaks and was always twisted up in a hard little\nknot behind with two wire hairpins stuck aggressively through it. She\nlooked like a woman of narrow experience and rigid conscience, which she\nwas; but there was a saving something about her mouth which, if it had\nbeen ever so slightly developed, might have been considered indicative\nof a sense of humor.\n\"We're all pretty well,\" said Mrs. Rachel. \"I was kind of afraid _you_\nweren't, though, when I saw Matthew starting off today. I thought maybe\nhe was going to the doctor's.\"\nMarilla's lips twitched understandingly. She had expected Mrs.\nRachel up; she had known that the sight of Matthew jaunting off so\nunaccountably would be too much for her neighbor's curiosity.\n\"Oh, no, I'm quite well although I had a bad headache yesterday,\" she\nsaid. \"Matthew went to Bright River. We're getting a little boy from an\norphan asylum in Nova Scotia and he's coming on the train tonight.\"\nIf Marilla had said that Matthew had gone to Bright River to meet a\nkangaroo from Australia Mrs. Rachel could not have been more astonished.\nShe was actually stricken dumb for five seconds. It was unsupposable\nthat Marilla was making fun of her, but Mrs. Rachel was almost forced to\nsuppose it.\n\"Are you in earnest, Marilla?\" she demanded when voice returned to her.\n\"Yes, of course,\" said Marilla, as if getting boys from orphan asylums\nin Nova Scotia were part of the usual spring work on any well-regulated\nAvonlea farm instead of being an unheard of innovation.\nMrs. Rachel felt that she had received a severe mental jolt. She thought\nin exclamation points. A boy! Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of all people\nadopting a boy! From an orphan asylum! Well, the world was certainly\nturning upside down! She would be surprised at nothing after this!\nNothing!\n\"What on earth put such a notion into your head?\" she demanded\ndisapprovingly.\nThis had been done without her advice being asked, and must perforce be\ndisapproved.\n\"Well, we've been thinking about it for some time--all winter in fact,\"\nreturned Marilla. \"Mrs. Alexander Spencer was up here one day before\nChristmas and she said she was going to get a little girl from the\nasylum over in Hopeton in the spring. Her cousin lives there and Mrs.\nSpencer has visited here and knows all about it. So Matthew and I have\ntalked it over off and on ever since. We thought we'd get a boy. Matthew\nis getting up in years, you know--he's sixty--and he isn't so spry as he\nonce was. His heart troubles him a good deal. And you know how desperate\nhard it's got to be to get hired help. There's never anybody to be had\nbut those stupid, half-grown little French boys; and as soon as you do\nget one broke into your ways and taught something he's up and off to the\nlobster canneries or the States. At first Matthew suggested getting a\nHome boy. But I said 'no' flat to that. 'They may be all right--I'm not\nsaying they're not--but no London street Arabs for me,' I said. 'Give\nme a native born at least. There'll be a risk, no matter who we get. But\nI'll feel easier in my mind and sleep sounder at nights if we get a born\nCanadian.' So in the end we decided to ask Mrs. Spencer to pick us out\none when she went over to get her little girl. We heard last week she\nwas going, so we sent her word by Richard Spencer's folks at Carmody\nto bring us a smart, likely boy of about ten or eleven. We decided that\nwould be the best age--old enough to be of some use in doing chores\nright off and young enough to be trained up proper. We mean to give him\na good home and schooling. We had a telegram from Mrs. Alexander Spencer\ntoday--the mail-man brought it from the station--saying they were coming\non the five-thirty train tonight. So Matthew went to Bright River to\nmeet him. Mrs. Spencer will drop him off there. Of course she goes on to\nWhite Sands station herself.\"\nMrs. Rachel prided herself on always speaking her mind; she proceeded to\nspeak it now, having adjusted her mental attitude to this amazing piece\nof news.\n\"Well, Marilla, I'll just tell you plain that I think you're doing a\nmighty foolish thing--a risky thing, that's what. You don't know what\nyou're getting. You're bringing a strange child into your house and home\nand you don't know a single thing about him nor what his disposition is\nlike nor what sort of parents he had nor how he's likely to turn out.\nWhy, it was only last week I read in the paper how a man and his wife up\nwest of the Island took a boy out of an orphan asylum and he set fire to\nthe house at night--set it _on purpose_, Marilla--and nearly burnt them to\na crisp in their beds. And I know another case where an adopted boy used\nto suck the eggs--they couldn't break him of it. If you had asked my\nadvice in the matter--which you didn't do, Marilla--I'd have said for\nmercy's sake not to think of such a thing, that's what.\"\nThis Job's comforting seemed neither to offend nor to alarm Marilla. She\nknitted steadily on.\n\"I don't deny there's something in what you say, Rachel. I've had some\nqualms myself. But Matthew was terrible set on it. I could see that, so\nI gave in. It's so seldom Matthew sets his mind on anything that when he\ndoes I always feel it's my duty to give in. And as for the risk, there's\nrisks in pretty near everything a body does in this world. There's risks\nin people's having children of their own if it comes to that--they don't\nalways turn out well. And then Nova Scotia is right close to the Island.\nIt isn't as if we were getting him from England or the States. He can't\nbe much different from ourselves.\"\n\"Well, I hope it will turn out all right,\" said Mrs. Rachel in a tone\nthat plainly indicated her painful doubts. \"Only don't say I didn't\nwarn you if he burns Green Gables down or puts strychnine in the well--I\nheard of a case over in New Brunswick where an orphan asylum child did\nthat and the whole family died in fearful agonies. Only, it was a girl\nin that instance.\"\n\"Well, we're not getting a girl,\" said Marilla, as if poisoning wells\nwere a purely feminine accomplishment and not to be dreaded in the case\nof a boy. \"I'd never dream of taking a girl to bring up. I wonder at\nMrs. Alexander Spencer for doing it. But there, _she_ wouldn't shrink\nfrom adopting a whole orphan asylum if she took it into her head.\"\nMrs. Rachel would have liked to stay until Matthew came home with his",

Matthew was not looking at her and would not have seen\nwhat she was really like if he had been, but an ordinary observer would\nhave seen this: A child of about eleven, garbed in a very short, very\ntight, very ugly dress of yellowish-gray wincey. She wore a faded brown\nsailor hat and beneath the hat, extending down her back, were two braids\nof very thick, decidedly red hair. Her face was small, white and thin,\nalso much freckled; her mouth was large and so were her eyes, which\nlooked green in some lights and moods and gray in others.\nSo far, the ordinary observer; an extraordinary observer might have seen\nthat the chin was very pointed and pronounced; that the big eyes\nwere full of spirit and vivacity; that the mouth was sweet-lipped\nand expressive; that the forehead was broad and full; in short,\nour discerning extraordinary observer might have concluded that no\ncommonplace soul inhabited the body of this stray woman-child of whom\nshy Matthew Cuthbert was so ludicrously afraid.\nMatthew, however, was spared the ordeal of speaking first, for as soon\nas she concluded that he was coming to her she stood up, grasping with\none thin brown hand the handle of a shabby, old-fashioned carpet-bag;\nthe other she held out to him.\n\"I suppose you are Mr. Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables?\" she said in\na peculiarly clear, sweet voice. \"I'm very glad to see you. I was\nbeginning to be afraid you weren't coming for me and I was imagining\nall the things that might have happened to prevent you. I had made up\nmy mind that if you didn't come for me to-night I'd go down the track to\nthat big wild cherry-tree at the bend, and climb up into it to stay all\nnight. I wouldn't be a bit afraid, and it would be lovely to sleep in a\nwild cherry-tree all white with bloom in the moonshine, don't you think?\nYou could imagine you were dwelling in marble halls, couldn't you? And\nI was quite sure you would come for me in the morning, if you didn't\nto-night.\"\nMatthew had taken the scrawny little hand awkwardly in his; then and\nthere he decided what to do. He could not tell this child with the\nglowing eyes that there had been a mistake; he would take her home and\nlet Marilla do that. She couldn't be left at Bright River anyhow, no\nmatter what mistake had been made, so all questions and explanations\nmight as well be deferred until he was safely back at Green Gables.\n\"I'm sorry I was late,\" he said shyly. \"Come along. The horse is over in\nthe yard. Give me your bag.\"\n\"Oh, I can carry it,\" the child responded cheerfully. \"It isn't heavy.",

And if it isn't\ncarried in just a certain way the handle pulls out--so I'd better\nkeep it because I know the exact knack of it. It's an extremely old\ncarpet-bag. Oh, I'm very glad you've come, even if it would have been\nnice to sleep in a wild cherry-tree. We've got to drive a long piece,\nhaven't we? Mrs. Spencer said it was eight miles. I'm glad because I\nlove driving. Oh, it seems so wonderful that I'm going to live with you\nand belong to you. I've never belonged to anybody--not really. But the\nasylum was the worst. I've only been in it four months, but that was\nenough. I don't suppose you ever were an orphan in an asylum, so you\ncan't possibly understand what it is like. It's worse than anything you\ncould imagine. Mrs. Spencer said it was wicked of me to talk like\nthat, but I didn't mean to be wicked. It's so easy to be wicked without\nknowing it, isn't it? They were good, you know--the asylum people. But\nthere is so little scope for the imagination in an asylum--only just\nin the other orphans. It was pretty interesting to imagine things about\nthem--to imagine that perhaps the girl who sat next to you was really\nthe daughter of a belted earl, who had been stolen away from her parents\nin her infancy by a cruel nurse who died before she could confess. I\nused to lie awake at nights and imagine things like that, because\nI didn't have time in the day. I guess that's why I'm so thin--I _am_\ndreadful thin, ain't I? There isn't a pick on my bones. I do love to\nimagine I'm nice and plump, with dimples in my elbows.\"\nWith this Matthew's companion stopped talking, partly because she was\nout of breath and partly because they had reached the buggy. Not another\nword did she say until they had left the village and were driving down\na steep little hill, the road part of which had been cut so deeply into\nthe soft soil, that the banks, fringed with blooming wild cherry-trees\nand slim white birches, were several feet above their heads.\nThe child put out her hand and broke off a branch of wild plum that\nbrushed against the side of the buggy.\n\"Isn't that beautiful? What did that tree, leaning out from the bank,\nall white and lacy, make you think of?\" she asked.\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Why, a bride, of course--a bride all in white with a lovely misty veil.\nI've never seen one, but I can imagine what she would look like. I don't\never expect to be a bride myself. I'm so homely nobody will ever want to\nmarry me--unless it might be a foreign missionary. I suppose a foreign\nmissionary mightn't be very particular. But I do hope that some day I\nshall have a white dress. That is my highest ideal of earthly bliss. I\njust love pretty clothes. And I've never had a pretty dress in my life\nthat I can remember--but of course it's all the more to look forward\nto, isn't it? And then I can imagine that I'm dressed gorgeously. This\nmorning when I left the asylum I felt so ashamed because I had to wear\nthis horrid old wincey dress. All the orphans had to wear them, you\nknow. A merchant in Hopeton last winter donated three hundred yards of\nwincey to the asylum. Some people said it was because he couldn't sell\nit, but I'd rather believe that it was out of the kindness of his heart,\nwouldn't you? When we got on the train I felt as if everybody must be\nlooking at me and pitying me. But I just went to work and imagined that\nI had on the most beautiful pale blue silk dress--because when you _are_\nimagining you might as well imagine something worth while--and a big\nhat all flowers and nodding plumes, and a gold watch, and kid gloves and\nboots. I felt cheered up right away and I enjoyed my trip to the Island\nwith all my might. I wasn't a bit sick coming over in the boat. Neither\nwas Mrs. Spencer although she generally is. She said she hadn't time\nto get sick, watching to see that I didn't fall overboard. She said she\nnever saw the beat of me for prowling about. But if it kept her from\nbeing seasick it's a mercy I did prowl, isn't it? And I wanted to see\neverything that was to be seen on that boat, because I didn't know\nwhether I'd ever have another opportunity. Oh, there are a lot more\ncherry-trees all in bloom! This Island is the bloomiest place. I just\nlove it already, and I'm so glad I'm going to live here. I've always\nheard that Prince Edward Island was the prettiest place in the world,\nand I used to imagine I was living here, but I never really expected I\nwould. It's delightful when your imaginations come true, isn't it?\nBut those red roads are so funny. When we got into the train at\nCharlottetown and the red roads began to flash past I asked Mrs. Spencer\nwhat made them red and she said she didn't know and for pity's sake not\nto ask her any more questions. She said I must have asked her a thousand\nalready. I suppose I had, too, but how you going to find out about\nthings if you don't ask questions? And what _does_ make the roads red?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Well, that is one of the things to find out sometime. Isn't it splendid\nto think of all the things there are to find out about? It just makes\nme feel glad to be alive--it's such an interesting world. It wouldn't be\nhalf so interesting if we know all about everything, would it? There'd\nbe no scope for imagination then, would there? But am I talking too\nmuch? People are always telling me I do. Would you rather I didn't\ntalk? If you say so I'll stop. I can _stop_ when I make up my mind to it,\nalthough it's difficult.\"\nMatthew, much to his own surprise, was enjoying himself. Like most quiet\nfolks he liked talkative people when they were willing to do the talking\nthemselves and did not expect him to keep up his end of it. But he had\nnever expected to enjoy the society of a little girl. Women were bad\nenough in all conscience, but little girls were worse. He detested the\nway they had of sidling past him timidly, with sidewise glances, as if\nthey expected him to gobble them up at a mouthful if they ventured to\nsay a word. That was the Avonlea type of well-bred little girl. But\nthis freckled witch was very different, and although he found it rather\ndifficult for his slower intelligence to keep up with her brisk mental\nprocesses he thought that he \"kind of liked her chatter.\" So he said as\nshyly as usual:\n\"Oh, you can talk as much as you like. I don't mind.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so glad. I know you and I are going to get along together\nfine. It's such a relief to talk when one wants to and not be told\nthat children should be seen and not heard. I've had that said to me a\nmillion times if I have once. And people laugh at me because I use big\nwords. But if you have big ideas you have to use big words to express\nthem, haven't you?\"\n\"Well now, that seems reasonable,\" said Matthew.\n\"Mrs. Spencer said that my tongue must be hung in the middle. But it\nisn't--it's firmly fastened at one end. Mrs. Spencer said your place was\nnamed Green Gables. I asked her all about it. And she said there were\ntrees all around it. I was gladder than ever. I just love trees. And\nthere weren't any at all about the asylum, only a few poor weeny-teeny\nthings out in front with little whitewashed cagey things about them.\nThey just looked like orphans themselves, those trees did. It used to\nmake me want to cry to look at them. I used to say to them, 'Oh, you\n_poor_ little things! If you were out in a great big woods with other\ntrees all around you and little mosses and June bells growing over your\nroots and a brook not far away and birds singing in you branches, you\ncould grow, couldn't you? But you can't where you are. I know just\nexactly how you feel, little trees.' I felt sorry to leave them behind\nthis morning. You do get so attached to things like that, don't you? Is\nthere a brook anywhere near Green Gables? I forgot to ask Mrs. Spencer\nthat.\"\n\"Well now, yes, there's one right below the house.\"\n\"Fancy. It's always been one of my dreams to live near a brook. I\nnever expected I would, though. Dreams don't often come true, do they?\nWouldn't it be nice if they did? But just now I feel pretty nearly\nperfectly happy. I can't feel exactly perfectly happy because--well,\nwhat color would you call this?\"\nShe twitched one of her long glossy braids over her thin shoulder and\nheld it up before Matthew's eyes. Matthew was not used to deciding on\nthe tints of ladies' tresses, but in this case there couldn't be much\ndoubt.\n\"It's red, ain't it?\" he said.\nThe girl let the braid drop back with a sigh that seemed to come from\nher very toes and to exhale forth all the sorrows of the ages.\n\"Yes, it's red,\" she said resignedly. \"Now you see why I can't be\nperfectly happy. Nobody could who has red hair. I don't mind the other\nthings so much--the freckles and the green eyes and my skinniness. I\ncan imagine them away. I can imagine that I have a beautiful rose-leaf\ncomplexion and lovely starry violet eyes. But I _cannot_ imagine that\nred hair away. I do my best. I think to myself, 'Now my hair is a\nglorious black, black as the raven's wing.' But all the time I _know_ it\nis just plain red and it breaks my heart. It will be my lifelong sorrow.\nI read of a girl once in a novel who had a lifelong sorrow but it wasn't\nred hair. Her hair was pure gold rippling back from her alabaster brow.\nWhat is an alabaster brow? I never could find out. Can you tell me?\"\n\"Well now, I'm afraid I can't,\" said Matthew, who was getting a little\ndizzy. He felt as he had once felt in his rash youth when another boy\nhad enticed him on the merry-go-round at a picnic.\n\"Well, whatever it was it must have been something nice because she was\ndivinely beautiful. Have you ever imagined what it must feel like to be\ndivinely beautiful?\"\n\"Well now, no, I haven't,\" confessed Matthew ingenuously.\n\"I have, often. Which would you rather be if you had the\nchoice--divinely beautiful or dazzlingly clever or angelically good?\"\n\"Well now, I--I don't know exactly.\"\n\"Neither do I. I can never decide. But it doesn't make much real\ndifference for it isn't likely I'll ever be either. It's certain I'll\nnever be angelically good. Mrs. Spencer says--oh, Mr. Cuthbert! Oh, Mr.\nCuthbert!! Oh, Mr. Cuthbert!!!\"\nThat was not what Mrs. Spencer had said; neither had the child tumbled\nout of the buggy nor had Matthew done anything astonishing. They had\nsimply rounded a curve in the road and found themselves in the \"Avenue.\"\nThe \"Avenue,\" so called by the Newbridge people, was a stretch of road\nfour or five hundred yards long, completely arched over with huge,\nwide-spreading apple-trees, planted years ago by an eccentric old\nfarmer. Overhead was one long canopy of snowy fragrant bloom. Below the\nboughs the air was full of a purple twilight and far ahead a glimpse\nof painted sunset sky shone like a great rose window at the end of a\ncathedral aisle.\nIts beauty seemed to strike the child dumb. She leaned back in the\nbuggy, her thin hands clasped before her, her face lifted rapturously to\nthe white splendor above. Even when they had passed out and were driving\ndown the long slope to Newbridge she never moved or spoke. Still with\nrapt face she gazed afar into the sunset west, with eyes that saw\nvisions trooping splendidly across that glowing background. Through\nNewbridge, a bustling little village where dogs barked at them and small\nboys hooted and curious faces peered from the windows, they drove, still\nin silence. When three more miles had dropped away behind them the child\nhad not spoken. She could keep silence, it was evident, as energetically\nas she could talk.\n\"I guess you're feeling pretty tired and hungry,\" Matthew ventured to\nsay at last, accounting for her long visitation of dumbness with the\nonly reason he could think of. \"But we haven't very far to go now--only\nanother mile.\"\nShe came out of her reverie with a deep sigh and looked at him with the\ndreamy gaze of a soul that had been wondering afar, star-led.\n\"Oh, Mr. Cuthbert,\" she whispered, \"that place we came through--that\nwhite place--what was it?\"\n\"Well now, you must mean the Avenue,\" said Matthew after a few moments'\nprofound reflection. \"It is a kind of pretty place.\"\n\"Pretty? Oh, _pretty_ doesn't seem the right word to use. Nor beautiful,\neither. They don't go far enough. Oh, it was wonderful--wonderful.\nIt's the first thing I ever saw that couldn't be improved upon by\nimagination. It just satisfies me here\"--she put one hand on her\nbreast--\"it made a queer funny ache and yet it was a pleasant ache. Did\nyou ever have an ache like that, Mr. Cuthbert?\"\n\"Well now, I just can't recollect that I ever had.\"\n\"I have it lots of time--whenever I see anything royally beautiful. But\nthey shouldn't call that lovely place the Avenue. There is no meaning\nin a name like that. They should call it--let me see--the White Way of\nDelight. Isn't that a nice imaginative name? When I don't like the name\nof a place or a person I always imagine a new one and always think of\nthem so. There was a girl at the asylum whose name was Hepzibah Jenkins,\nbut I always imagined her as Rosalia DeVere. Other people may call that\nplace the Avenue, but I shall always call it the White Way of Delight.\nHave we really only another mile to go before we get home? I'm glad and\nI'm sorry. I'm sorry because this drive has been so pleasant and I'm\nalways sorry when pleasant things end. Something still pleasanter may\ncome after, but you can never be sure. And it's so often the case that\nit isn't pleasanter. That has been my experience anyhow. But I'm glad to\nthink of getting home. You see, I've never had a real home since I can\nremember. It gives me that pleasant ache again just to think of coming\nto a really truly home. Oh, isn't that pretty!\"\nThey had driven over the crest of a hill. Below them was a pond, looking\nalmost like a river so long and winding was it. A bridge spanned it\nmidway and from there to its lower end, where an amber-hued belt of\nsand-hills shut it in from the dark blue gulf beyond, the water was a\nglory of many shifting hues--the most spiritual shadings of crocus and\nrose and ethereal green, with other elusive tintings for which no name\nhas ever been found. Above the bridge the pond ran up into fringing\ngroves of fir and maple and lay all darkly translucent in their wavering\nshadows. Here and there a wild plum leaned out from the bank like a\nwhite-clad girl tip-toeing to her own reflection. From the marsh at the\nhead of the pond came the clear, mournfully-sweet chorus of the frogs.\nThere was a little gray house peering around a white apple orchard on\na slope beyond and, although it was not yet quite dark, a light was\nshining from one of its windows.\n\"That's Barry's pond,\" said Matthew.\n\"Oh, I don't like that name, either. I shall call it--let me see--the\nLake of Shining Waters. Yes, that is the right name for it. I know\nbecause of the thrill. When I hit on a name that suits exactly it gives\nme a thrill. Do things ever give you a thrill?\"\nMatthew ruminated.\n\"Well now, yes. It always kind of gives me a thrill to see them ugly\nwhite grubs that spade up in the cucumber beds. I hate the look of\nthem.\"\n\"Oh, I don't think that can be exactly the same kind of a thrill. Do you\nthink it can? There doesn't seem to be much connection between grubs\nand lakes of shining waters, does there? But why do other people call it\nBarry's pond?\"\n\"I reckon because Mr. Barry lives up there in that house. Orchard\nSlope's the name of his place. If it wasn't for that big bush behind it\nyou could see Green Gables from here. But we have to go over the bridge\nand round by the road, so it's near half a mile further.\"\n\"Has Mr. Barry any little girls? Well, not so very little either--about\nmy size.\"\n\"He's got one about eleven. Her name is Diana.\"\n\"Oh!\" with a long indrawing of breath. \"What a perfectly lovely name!\"\n\"Well now, I dunno. There's something dreadful heathenish about it,\nseems to me. I'd ruther Jane or Mary or some sensible name like that.\nBut when Diana was born there was a schoolmaster boarding there and they\ngave him the naming of her and he called her Diana.\"\n\"I wish there had been a schoolmaster like that around when I was born,\nthen. Oh, here we are at the bridge. I'm going to shut my eyes tight.\nI'm always afraid going over bridges. I can't help imagining that\nperhaps just as we get to the middle, they'll crumple up like a\njack-knife and nip us. So I shut my eyes. But I always have to open them\nfor all when I think we're getting near the middle. Because, you see, if\nthe bridge _did_ crumple up I'd want to _see_ it crumple. What a jolly\nrumble it makes! I always like the rumble part of it. Isn't it splendid\nthere are so many things to like in this world? There we're over. Now\nI'll look back. Good night, dear Lake of Shining Waters. I always say\ngood night to the things I love, just as I would to people. I think they\nlike it. That water looks as if it was smiling at me.\"",

That's Green Gables over--\"\n\"Oh, don't tell me,\" she interrupted breathlessly, catching at his\npartially raised arm and shutting her eyes that she might not see his\ngesture. \"Let me guess. I'm sure I'll guess right.\"\nShe opened her eyes and looked about her. They were on the crest of a\nhill. The sun had set some time since, but the landscape was still\nclear in the mellow afterlight. To the west a dark church spire rose\nup against a marigold sky. Below was a little valley and beyond a long,\ngently-rising slope with snug farmsteads scattered along it. From one\nto another the child's eyes darted, eager and wistful. At last they\nlingered on one away to the left, far back from the road, dimly white\nwith blossoming trees in the twilight of the surrounding woods. Over it,\nin the stainless southwest sky, a great crystal-white star was shining\nlike a lamp of guidance and promise.\n\"That's it, isn't it?\" she said, pointing.\nMatthew slapped the reins on the sorrel's back delightedly.\n\"Well now, you've guessed it! But I reckon Mrs. Spencer described it\nso's you could tell.\"\n\"No, she didn't--really she didn't. All she said might just as well have\nbeen about most of those other places. I hadn't any real idea what it\nlooked like. But just as soon as I saw it I felt it was home. Oh, it\nseems as if I must be in a dream. Do you know, my arm must be black and\nblue from the elbow up, for I've pinched myself so many times today.\nEvery little while a horrible sickening feeling would come over me and\nI'd be so afraid it was all a dream. Then I'd pinch myself to see if it\nwas real--until suddenly I remembered that even supposing it was only\na dream I'd better go on dreaming as long as I could; so I stopped\npinching. But it _is_ real and we're nearly home.\"\nWith a sigh of rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred\nuneasily. He felt glad that it would be Marilla and not he who would\nhave to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was\nnot to be hers after all. They drove over Lynde's Hollow, where it was\nalready quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them\nfrom her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green\nGables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was shrinking from\nthe approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was\nnot of Marilla or himself he was thinking or of the trouble this mistake\nwas probably going to make for them, but of the child's disappointment.\nWhen he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had\nan uncomfortable feeling that he was going to assist at murdering\nsomething--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill\na lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.\nThe yard was quite dark as they turned into it and the poplar leaves\nwere rustling silkily all round it.\n\"Listen to the trees talking in their sleep,\" she whispered, as he\nlifted her to the ground. \"What nice dreams they must have!\"\nThen, holding tightly to the carpet-bag which contained \"all her worldly\ngoods,\" she followed him into the house.",

But there _must_ have been a boy,\" insisted Marilla. \"We sent\nword to Mrs. Spencer to bring a boy.\"\n\"Well, she didn't. She brought _her_. I asked the station-master. And I\nhad to bring her home. She couldn't be left there, no matter where the\nmistake had come in.\"\n\"Well, this is a pretty piece of business!\" ejaculated Marilla.\nDuring this dialogue the child had remained silent, her eyes roving from\none to the other, all the animation fading out of her face. Suddenly\nshe seemed to grasp the full meaning of what had been said. Dropping her\nprecious carpet-bag she sprang forward a step and clasped her hands.\n\"You don't want me!\" she cried. \"You don't want me because I'm not a\nboy! I might have expected it. Nobody ever did want me. I might have\nknown it was all too beautiful to last. I might have known nobody really\ndid want me. Oh, what shall I do? I'm going to burst into tears!\"\nBurst into tears she did. Sitting down on a chair by the table, flinging\nher arms out upon it, and burying her face in them, she proceeded to cry\nstormily. Marilla and Matthew looked at each other deprecatingly across\nthe stove. Neither of them knew what to say or do. Finally Marilla\nstepped lamely into the breach.\n\"Well, well, there's no need to cry so about it.\"\n\"Yes, there _is_ need!\" The child raised her head quickly, revealing a\ntear-stained face and trembling lips. \"_You_ would cry, too, if you were\nan orphan and had come to a place you thought was going to be home and\nfound that they didn't want you because you weren't a boy. Oh, this is\nthe most _tragical_ thing that ever happened to me!\"\nSomething like a reluctant smile, rather rusty from long disuse,\nmellowed Marilla's grim expression.\n\"Well, don't cry any more.

But, although it was neat and clean, it did not seem quite the\nthing to put a girl there somehow. But the spare room was out of the\nquestion for such a stray waif, so there remained only the east gable\nroom. Marilla lighted a candle and told Anne to follow her, which Anne\nspiritlessly did, taking her hat and carpet-bag from the hall table as\nshe passed. The hall was fearsomely clean; the little gable chamber in\nwhich she presently found herself seemed still cleaner.\nMarilla set the candle on a three-legged, three-cornered table and\nturned down the bedclothes.\n\"I suppose you have a nightgown?\" she questioned.\nAnne nodded.\n\"Yes, I have two. The matron of the asylum made them for me. They're\nfearfully skimpy. There is never enough to go around in an asylum, so\nthings are always skimpy--at least in a poor asylum like ours. I hate\nskimpy night-dresses. But one can dream just as well in them as\nin lovely trailing ones, with frills around the neck, that's one\nconsolation.\"\n\"Well, undress as quick as you can and go to bed. I'll come back in a\nfew minutes for the candle. I daren't trust you to put it out yourself.\nYou'd likely set the place on fire.\"\nWhen Marilla had gone Anne looked around her wistfully. The whitewashed\nwalls were so painfully bare and staring that she thought they must ache\nover their own bareness. The floor was bare, too, except for a round\nbraided mat in the middle such as Anne had never seen before. In\none corner was the bed, a high, old-fashioned one, with four dark,\nlow-turned posts. In the other corner was the aforesaid three-corner\ntable adorned with a fat, red velvet pin-cushion hard enough to turn the\npoint of the most adventurous pin. Above it hung a little six-by-eight\nmirror. Midway between table and bed was the window, with an icy white\nmuslin frill over it, and opposite it was the wash-stand. The whole\napartment was of a rigidity not to be described in words, but which\nsent a shiver to the very marrow of Anne's bones. With a sob she hastily\ndiscarded her garments, put on the skimpy nightgown and sprang into bed\nwhere she burrowed face downward into the pillow and pulled the clothes\nover her head. When Marilla came up for the light various skimpy\narticles of raiment scattered most untidily over the floor and a certain\ntempestuous appearance of the bed were the only indications of any",

First came a\ndelightful thrill, as something very pleasant; then a horrible\nremembrance. This was Green Gables and they didn't want her because she\nwasn't a boy!\nBut it was morning and, yes, it was a cherry-tree in full bloom outside\nof her window. With a bound she was out of bed and across the floor.\nShe pushed up the sash--it went up stiffly and creakily, as if it hadn't\nbeen opened for a long time, which was the case; and it stuck so tight\nthat nothing was needed to hold it up.\nAnne dropped on her knees and gazed out into the June morning, her eyes\nglistening with delight. Oh, wasn't it beautiful? Wasn't it a lovely\nplace? Suppose she wasn't really going to stay here! She would imagine\nshe was. There was scope for imagination here.\nA huge cherry-tree grew outside, so close that its boughs tapped against\nthe house, and it was so thick-set with blossoms that hardly a leaf\nwas to be seen. On both sides of the house was a big orchard, one of\napple-trees and one of cherry-trees, also showered over with blossoms;\nand their grass was all sprinkled with dandelions. In the garden below\nwere lilac-trees purple with flowers, and their dizzily sweet fragrance\ndrifted up to the window on the morning wind.\nBelow the garden a green field lush with clover sloped down to the\nhollow where the brook ran and where scores of white birches grew,\nupspringing airily out of an undergrowth suggestive of delightful\npossibilities in ferns and mosses and woodsy things generally. Beyond it\nwas a hill, green and feathery with spruce and fir; there was a gap in\nit where the gray gable end of the little house she had seen from the\nother side of the Lake of Shining Waters was visible.\nOff to the left were the big barns and beyond them, away down over\ngreen, low-sloping fields, was a sparkling blue glimpse of sea.\nAnne's beauty-loving eyes lingered on it all, taking everything greedily\nin. She had looked on so many unlovely places in her life, poor child;\nbut this was as lovely as anything she had ever dreamed.\nShe knelt there, lost to everything but the loveliness around her, until\nshe was startled by a hand on her shoulder.

As a matter of\nfact, however, she had forgotten to turn back the bedclothes.\n\"I'm pretty hungry this morning,\" she announced as she slipped into the\nchair Marilla placed for her. \"The world doesn't seem such a howling\nwilderness as it did last night. I'm so glad it's a sunshiny morning.\nBut I like rainy mornings real well, too. All sorts of mornings are\ninteresting, don't you think? You don't know what's going to happen\nthrough the day, and there's so much scope for imagination. But I'm\nglad it's not rainy today because it's easier to be cheerful and bear\nup under affliction on a sunshiny day. I feel that I have a good deal\nto bear up under. It's all very well to read about sorrows and imagine\nyourself living through them heroically, but it's not so nice when you\nreally come to have them, is it?\"\n\"For pity's sake hold your tongue,\" said Marilla. \"You talk entirely too\nmuch for a little girl.\"\nThereupon Anne held her tongue so obediently and thoroughly that her\ncontinued silence made Marilla rather nervous, as if in the presence of\nsomething not exactly natural. Matthew also held his tongue,--but this\nwas natural,--so that the meal was a very silent one.\nAs it progressed Anne became more and more abstracted, eating\nmechanically, with her big eyes fixed unswervingly and unseeingly on the\nsky outside the window. This made Marilla more nervous than ever; she\nhad an uncomfortable feeling that while this odd child's body might\nbe there at the table her spirit was far away in some remote airy\ncloudland, borne aloft on the wings of imagination.

How far is it to White Sands?\"\n\"It's five miles; and as you're evidently bent on talking you might as\nwell talk to some purpose by telling me what you know about yourself.\"\n\"Oh, what I _know_ about myself isn't really worth telling,\" said Anne\neagerly. \"If you'll only let me tell you what I _imagine_ about myself\nyou'll think it ever so much more interesting.\"\n\"No, I don't want any of your imaginings. Just you stick to bald facts.\nBegin at the beginning. Where were you born and how old are you?\"\n\"I was eleven last March,\" said Anne, resigning herself to bald facts\nwith a little sigh. \"And I was born in Bolingbroke, Nova Scotia.\nMy father's name was Walter Shirley, and he was a teacher in the\nBolingbroke High School. My mother's name was Bertha Shirley. Aren't\nWalter and Bertha lovely names? I'm so glad my parents had nice names.\nIt would be a real disgrace to have a father named--well, say Jedediah,\nwouldn't it?\"\n\"I guess it doesn't matter what a person's name is as long as he behaves\nhimself,\" said Marilla, feeling herself called upon to inculcate a good\nand useful moral.\n\"Well, I don't know.\" Anne looked thoughtful. \"I read in a book once\nthat a rose by any other name would smell as sweet, but I've never been\nable to believe it. I don't believe a rose _would_ be as nice if it was\ncalled a thistle or a skunk cabbage. I suppose my father could have been\na good man even if he had been called Jedediah; but I'm sure it would\nhave been a cross. Well, my mother was a teacher in the High school,\ntoo, but when she married father she gave up teaching, of course. A\nhusband was enough responsibility. Mrs. Thomas said that they were\na pair of babies and as poor as church mice. They went to live in a\nweeny-teeny little yellow house in Bolingbroke. I've never seen that\nhouse, but I've imagined it thousands of times. I think it must have\nhad honeysuckle over the parlor window and lilacs in the front yard and\nlilies of the valley just inside the gate. Yes, and muslin curtains in\nall the windows. Muslin curtains give a house such an air. I was born\nin that house. Mrs. Thomas said I was the homeliest baby she ever saw, I\nwas so scrawny and tiny and nothing but eyes, but that mother thought I\nwas perfectly beautiful. I should think a mother would be a better judge\nthan a poor woman who came in to scrub, wouldn't you? I'm glad she\nwas satisfied with me anyhow, I would feel so sad if I thought I was a\ndisappointment to her--because she didn't live very long after that, you\nsee. She died of fever when I was just three months old. I do wish she'd\nlived long enough for me to remember calling her mother. I think it\nwould be so sweet to say 'mother,' don't you? And father died four days\nafterwards from fever too. That left me an orphan and folks were at\ntheir wits' end, so Mrs. Thomas said, what to do with me. You see,\nnobody wanted me even then. It seems to be my fate. Father and mother\nhad both come from places far away and it was well known they hadn't any\nrelatives living. Finally Mrs. Thomas said she'd take me, though she was\npoor and had a drunken husband. She brought me up by hand. Do you know\nif there is anything in being brought up by hand that ought to make\npeople who are brought up that way better than other people? Because\nwhenever I was naughty Mrs. Thomas would ask me how I could be such a\nbad girl when she had brought me up by hand--reproachful-like.\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Thomas moved away from Bolingbroke to Marysville, and I\nlived with them until I was eight years old. I helped look after the\nThomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and I can tell\nyou they took a lot of looking after. Then Mr. Thomas was killed\nfalling under a train and his mother offered to take Mrs. Thomas and the\nchildren, but she didn't want me. Mrs. Thomas was at _her_ wits' end, so\nshe said, what to do with me. Then Mrs. Hammond from up the river came\ndown and said she'd take me, seeing I was handy with children, and\nI went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the\nstumps. It was a very lonesome place. I'm sure I could never have\nlived there if I hadn't had an imagination. Mr. Hammond worked a little\nsawmill up there, and Mrs. Hammond had eight children. She had twins\nthree times. I like babies in moderation, but twins three times in\nsuccession is _too much_. I told Mrs. Hammond so firmly, when the last\npair came. I used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.\n\"I lived up river with Mrs. Hammond over two years, and then Mr. Hammond\ndied and Mrs. Hammond broke up housekeeping. She divided her children\namong her relatives and went to the States. I had to go to the asylum\nat Hopeton, because nobody would take me. They didn't want me at the\nasylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. But they had\nto take me and I was there four months until Mrs. Spencer came.\"\nAnne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. Evidently\nshe did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not\nwanted her.\n\"Did you ever go to school?\" demanded Marilla, turning the sorrel mare\ndown the shore road.\n\"Not a great deal. I went a little the last year I stayed with Mrs.\nThomas. When I went up river we were so far from a school that I\ncouldn't walk it in winter and there was a vacation in summer, so I\ncould only go in the spring and fall. But of course I went while I was\nat the asylum. I can read pretty well and I know ever so many pieces of\npoetry off by heart--'The Battle of Hohenlinden' and 'Edinburgh after\nFlodden,' and 'Bingen of the Rhine,' and most of the 'Lady of the Lake'\nand most of 'The Seasons' by James Thompson. Don't you just love poetry\nthat gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back? There is a piece\nin the Fifth Reader--'The Downfall of Poland'--that is just full of\nthrills. Of course, I wasn't in the Fifth Reader--I was only in the\nFourth--but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read.\"\n\"Were those women--Mrs. Thomas and Mrs. Hammond--good to you?\" asked\nMarilla, looking at Anne out of the corner of her eye.\n\"O-o-o-h,\" faltered Anne. Her sensitive little face suddenly flushed\nscarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow. \"Oh, they _meant_ to be--I know\nthey meant to be just as good and kind as possible. And when people\nmean to be good to you, you don't mind very much when they're not\nquite--always. They had a good deal to worry them, you know. It's a very\ntrying to have a drunken husband, you see; and it must be very trying to\nhave twins three times in succession, don't you think? But I feel sure\nthey meant to be good to me.\"\nMarilla asked no more questions. Anne gave herself up to a silent\nrapture over the shore road and Marilla guided the sorrel abstractedly\nwhile she pondered deeply. Pity was suddenly stirring in her heart for\nthe child. What a starved, unloved life she had had--a life of drudgery\nand poverty and neglect; for Marilla was shrewd enough to read between\nthe lines of Anne's history and divine the truth. No wonder she had been\nso delighted at the prospect of a real home. It was a pity she had to be\nsent back. What if she, Marilla, should indulge Matthew's unaccountable\nwhim and let her stay? He was set on it; and the child seemed a nice,\nteachable little thing.\n\"She's got too much to say,\" thought Marilla, \"but she might be trained\nout of that. And there's nothing rude or slangy in what she does say.\nShe's ladylike. It's likely her people were nice folks.\"\nThe shore road was \"woodsy and wild and lonesome.\" On the right hand,\nscrub firs, their spirits quite unbroken by long years of tussle with\nthe gulf winds, grew thickly. On the left were the steep red sandstone\ncliffs, so near the track in places that a mare of less steadiness than\nthe sorrel might have tried the nerves of the people behind her. Down\nat the base of the cliffs were heaps of surf-worn rocks or little sandy\ncoves inlaid with pebbles as with ocean jewels; beyond lay the sea,\nshimmering and blue, and over it soared the gulls, their pinions\nflashing silvery in the sunlight.\n\"Isn't the sea wonderful?\" said Anne, rousing from a long, wide-eyed\nsilence. \"Once, when I lived in Marysville, Mr. Thomas hired an express\nwagon and took us all to spend the day at the shore ten miles away.\nI enjoyed every moment of that day, even if I had to look after the\nchildren all the time. I lived it over in happy dreams for years.\nBut this shore is nicer than the Marysville shore. Aren't those gulls\nsplendid? Would you like to be a gull? I think I would--that is, if I\ncouldn't be a human girl. Don't you think it would be nice to wake up at\nsunrise and swoop down over the water and away out over that lovely blue\nall day; and then at night to fly back to one's nest? Oh, I can just\nimagine myself doing it. What big house is that just ahead, please?\"\n\"That's the White Sands Hotel. Mr. Kirke runs it, but the season hasn't\nbegun yet. There are heaps of Americans come there for the summer. They\nthink this shore is just about right.\"\n\"I was afraid it might be Mrs. Spencer's place,\" said Anne mournfully.\n\"I don't want to get there. Somehow, it will seem like the end of",

Mrs. Spencer lived in a big\nyellow house at White Sands Cove, and she came to the door with surprise\nand welcome mingled on her benevolent face.\n\"Dear, dear,\" she exclaimed, \"you're the last folks I was looking for\ntoday, but I'm real glad to see you. You'll put your horse in? And how\nare you, Anne?\"\n\"I'm as well as can be expected, thank you,\" said Anne smilelessly. A\nblight seemed to have descended on her.\n\"I suppose we'll stay a little while to rest the mare,\" said Marilla,\n\"but I promised Matthew I'd be home early. The fact is, Mrs. Spencer,\nthere's been a queer mistake somewhere, and I've come over to see where\nit is. We send word, Matthew and I, for you to bring us a boy from the\nasylum. We told your brother Robert to tell you we wanted a boy ten or\neleven years old.\"\n\"Marilla Cuthbert, you don't say so!\" said Mrs. Spencer in distress.\n\"Why, Robert sent word down by his daughter Nancy and she said you\nwanted a girl--didn't she Flora Jane?\" appealing to her daughter who had\ncome out to the steps.\n\"She certainly did, Miss Cuthbert,\" corroborated Flora Jane earnestly.\n\"I'm dreadful sorry,\" said Mrs. Spencer. \"It's too bad; but it certainly\nwasn't my fault, you see, Miss Cuthbert. I did the best I could and I\nthought I was following your instructions. Nancy is a terrible flighty\nthing. I've often had to scold her well for her heedlessness.\"\n\"It was our own fault,\" said Marilla resignedly. \"We should have come\nto you ourselves and not left an important message to be passed along by\nword of mouth in that fashion. Anyhow, the mistake has been made and the\nonly thing to do is to set it right. Can we send the child back to the\nasylum? I suppose they'll take her back, won't they?\"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Mrs. Spencer thoughtfully, \"but I don't think\nit will be necessary to send her back. Mrs. Peter Blewett was up here\nyesterday, and she was saying to me how much she wished she'd sent by me\nfor a little girl to help her. Mrs. Peter has a large family, you know,\nand she finds it hard to get help. Anne will be the very girl for you. I\ncall it positively providential.\"\nMarilla did not look as if she thought Providence had much to do with\nthe matter. Here was an unexpectedly good chance to get this unwelcome\norphan off her hands, and she did not even feel grateful for it.\nShe knew Mrs. Peter Blewett only by sight as a small, shrewish-faced\nwoman without an ounce of superfluous flesh on her bones. But she had\nheard of her. \"A terrible worker and driver,\" Mrs. Peter was said to\nbe; and discharged servant girls told fearsome tales of her temper and\nstinginess, and her family of pert, quarrelsome children. Marilla felt\na qualm of conscience at the thought of handing Anne over to her tender\nmercies.\n\"Well, I'll go in and we'll talk the matter over,\" she said.\n\"And if there isn't Mrs. Peter coming up the lane this blessed minute!\"\nexclaimed Mrs. Spencer, bustling her guests through the hall into the\nparlor, where a deadly chill struck on them as if the air had been",

She felt a lump coming up in her\nthroat and her eyes smarted painfully. She was beginning to be afraid\nshe couldn't keep the tears back when Mrs. Spencer returned, flushed\nand beaming, quite capable of taking any and every difficulty, physical,\nmental or spiritual, into consideration and settling it out of hand.\n\"It seems there's been a mistake about this little girl, Mrs. Blewett,\"\nshe said. \"I was under the impression that Mr. and Miss Cuthbert wanted\na little girl to adopt.

You don't look as if there was much to you. But you're wiry. I\ndon't know but the wiry ones are the best after all. Well, if I take you\nyou'll have to be a good girl, you know--good and smart and respectful.\nI'll expect you to earn your keep, and no mistake about that.

More-over, she did\nnot fancy Mrs. Blewett. To hand a sensitive, \"highstrung\" child over to\nsuch a woman! No, she could not take the responsibility of doing that!\n\"Well, I don't know,\" she said slowly. \"I didn't say that Matthew and I\nhad absolutely decided that we wouldn't keep her.

And mind, Matthew, you're not to go interfering with\nmy methods. Perhaps an old maid doesn't know much about bringing up\na child, but I guess she knows more than an old bachelor. So you just\nleave me to manage her. When I fail it'll be time enough to put your oar\nin.\"\n\"There, there, Marilla, you can have your own way,\" said Matthew\nreassuringly. \"Only be as good and kind to her as you can without\nspoiling her. I kind of think she's one of the sort you can do anything\nwith if you only get her to love you.\"\nMarilla sniffed, to express her contempt for Matthew's opinions\nconcerning anything feminine, and walked off to the dairy with the\npails.\n\"I won't tell her tonight that she can stay,\" she reflected, as she\nstrained the milk into the creamers. \"She'd be so excited that she\nwouldn't sleep a wink. Marilla Cuthbert, you're fairly in for it. Did\nyou ever suppose you'd see the day when you'd be adopting an orphan\ngirl?

I haven't any use at all for\nlittle girls who aren't neat.\"\n\"I was so harrowed up in my mind last night that I didn't think about my\nclothes at all,\" said Anne. \"I'll fold them nicely tonight. They always\nmade us do that at the asylum. Half the time, though, I'd forget, I'd be\nin such a hurry to get into bed nice and quiet and imagine things.\"\n\"You'll have to remember a little better if you stay here,\" admonished\nMarilla. \"There, that looks something like. Say your prayers now and get\ninto bed.\"\n\"I never say any prayers,\" announced Anne.\nMarilla looked horrified astonishment.\n\"Why, Anne, what do you mean? Were you never taught to say your prayers?\nGod always wants little girls to say their prayers. Don't you know who\nGod is, Anne?\"\n\"'God is a spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable, in His being,\nwisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness, and truth,'\" responded Anne\npromptly and glibly.\nMarilla looked rather relieved.\n\"So you do know something then, thank goodness! You're not quite a\nheathen. Where did you learn that?\"\n\"Oh, at the asylum Sunday-school. They made us learn the whole\ncatechism. I liked it pretty well. There's something splendid about some\nof the words. 'Infinite, eternal and unchangeable.' Isn't that grand? It\nhas such a roll to it--just like a big organ playing. You couldn't quite\ncall it poetry, I suppose, but it sounds a lot like it, doesn't it?\"\n\"We're not talking about poetry, Anne--we are talking about saying your\nprayers. Don't you know it's a terrible wicked thing not to say your\nprayers every night? I'm afraid you are a very bad little girl.\"\n\"You'd find it easier to be bad than good if you had red hair,\" said\nAnne reproachfully. \"People who haven't red hair don't know what trouble\nis. Mrs. Thomas told me that God made my hair red _on purpose_, and I've\nnever cared about Him since. And anyhow I'd always be too tired at night\nto bother saying prayers. People who have to look after twins can't be\nexpected to say their prayers. Now, do you honestly think they can?\"\nMarilla decided that Anne's religious training must be begun at once.\nPlainly there was no time to be lost.\n\"You must say your prayers while you are under my roof, Anne.\"\n\"Why, of course, if you want me to,\" assented Anne cheerfully. \"I'd do\nanything to oblige you.

She tucked\nthe child up in bed, mentally vowing that she should be taught a prayer\nthe very next day, and was leaving the room with the light when Anne\ncalled her back.\n\"I've just thought of it now. I should have said, 'Amen' in place\nof 'yours respectfully,' shouldn't I?--the way the ministers do. I'd\nforgotten it, but I felt a prayer should be finished off in some way, so\nI put in the other. Do you suppose it will make any difference?\"\n\"I--I don't suppose it will,\" said Marilla. \"Go to sleep now like a good",

During the\nforenoon she kept the child busy with various tasks and watched over her\nwith a keen eye while she did them. By noon she had concluded that Anne\nwas smart and obedient, willing to work and quick to learn; her most\nserious shortcoming seemed to be a tendency to fall into daydreams in\nthe middle of a task and forget all about it until such time as she was\nsharply recalled to earth by a reprimand or a catastrophe.\nWhen Anne had finished washing the dinner dishes she suddenly confronted\nMarilla with the air and expression of one desperately determined to\nlearn the worst. Her thin little body trembled from head to foot; her\nface flushed and her eyes dilated until they were almost black; she\nclasped her hands tightly and said in an imploring voice:\n\"Oh, please, Miss Cuthbert, won't you tell me if you are going to send\nme away or not? I've tried to be patient all the morning, but I really\nfeel that I cannot bear not knowing any longer. It's a dreadful feeling.\nPlease tell me.\"\n\"You haven't scalded the dishcloth in clean hot water as I told you to\ndo,\" said Marilla immovably. \"Just go and do it before you ask any more\nquestions, Anne.\"\nAnne went and attended to the dishcloth. Then she returned to Marilla\nand fastened imploring eyes of the latter's face. \"Well,\" said Marilla,\nunable to find any excuse for deferring her explanation longer, \"I\nsuppose I might as well tell you. Matthew and I have decided to keep\nyou--that is, if you will try to be a good little girl and show yourself\ngrateful. Why, child, whatever is the matter?\"\n\"I'm crying,\" said Anne in a tone of bewilderment. \"I can't think why.\nI'm glad as glad can be. Oh, _glad_ doesn't seem the right word at all. I\nwas glad about the White Way and the cherry blossoms--but this! Oh, it's\nsomething more than glad. I'm so happy. I'll try to be so good. It\nwill be uphill work, I expect, for Mrs. Thomas often told me I was\ndesperately wicked. However, I'll do my very best. But can you tell me\nwhy I'm crying?\"\n\"I suppose it's because you're all excited and worked up,\" said Marilla\ndisapprovingly. \"Sit down on that chair and try to calm yourself. I'm\nafraid you both cry and laugh far too easily. Yes, you can stay here and\nwe will try to do right by you. You must go to school; but it's only a\nfortnight till vacation so it isn't worth while for you to start before",

I'm not used to being called\nMiss Cuthbert and it would make me nervous.\"\n\"It sounds awfully disrespectful to just say Marilla,\" protested Anne.\n\"I guess there'll be nothing disrespectful in it if you're careful\nto speak respectfully. Everybody, young and old, in Avonlea calls me\nMarilla except the minister. He says Miss Cuthbert--when he thinks of\nit.\"\n\"I'd love to call you Aunt Marilla,\" said Anne wistfully. \"I've never\nhad an aunt or any relation at all--not even a grandmother. It would\nmake me feel as if I really belonged to you. Can't I call you Aunt\nMarilla?\"\n\"No. I'm not your aunt and I don't believe in calling people names that\ndon't belong to them.\"\n\"But we could imagine you were my aunt.\"\n\"I couldn't,\" said Marilla grimly.\n\"Do you never imagine things different from what they really are?\" asked\nAnne wide-eyed.\n\"No.\"\n\"Oh!\" Anne drew a long breath. \"Oh, Miss--Marilla, how much you miss!\"\n\"I don't believe in imagining things different from what they really\nare,\" retorted Marilla. \"When the Lord puts us in certain circumstances\nHe doesn't mean for us to imagine them away. And that reminds me. Go\ninto the sitting room, Anne--be sure your feet are clean and don't\nlet any flies in--and bring me out the illustrated card that's on the\nmantelpiece. The Lord's Prayer is on it and you'll devote your spare\ntime this afternoon to learning it off by heart. There's to be no more\nof such praying as I heard last night.\"\n\"I suppose I was very awkward,\" said Anne apologetically, \"but then, you\nsee, I'd never had any practice. You couldn't really expect a person\nto pray very well the first time she tried, could you? I thought out a\nsplendid prayer after I went to bed, just as I promised you I would.\nIt was nearly as long as a minister's and so poetical. But would you\nbelieve it? I couldn't remember one word when I woke up this morning.\nAnd I'm afraid I'll never be able to think out another one as good.\nSomehow, things never are so good when they're thought out a second\ntime. Have you ever noticed that?\"\n\"Here is something for you to notice, Anne. When I tell you to do\na thing I want you to obey me at once and not stand stock-still and\ndiscourse about it. Just you go and do as I bid you.\"\nAnne promptly departed for the sitting-room across the hall; she failed\nto return; after waiting ten minutes Marilla laid down her knitting\nand marched after her with a grim expression. She found Anne standing\nmotionless before a picture hanging on the wall between the two windows,\nwith her eyes a-star with dreams. The white and green light strained\nthrough apple trees and clustering vines outside fell over the rapt\nlittle figure with a half-unearthly radiance.\n\"Anne, whatever are you thinking of?\" demanded Marilla sharply.\nAnne came back to earth with a start.\n\"That,\" she said, pointing to the picture--a rather vivid chromo\nentitled, \"Christ Blessing Little Children\"--\"and I was just imagining I\nwas one of them--that I was the little girl in the blue dress, standing\noff by herself in the corner as if she didn't belong to anybody, like\nme. She looks lonely and sad, don't you think? I guess she hadn't any\nfather or mother of her own. But she wanted to be blessed, too, so she\njust crept shyly up on the outside of the crowd, hoping nobody would\nnotice her--except Him. I'm sure I know just how she felt. Her heart\nmust have beat and her hands must have got cold, like mine did when I\nasked you if I could stay. She was afraid He mightn't notice her. But\nit's likely He did, don't you think?

I've dreamed of meeting her all\nmy life. I never really supposed I would, but so many of my loveliest\ndreams have come true all at once that perhaps this one will, too. Do\nyou think it's possible?\"\n\"Diana Barry lives over at Orchard Slope and she's about your age. She's\na very nice little girl, and perhaps she will be a playmate for you when\nshe comes home. She's visiting her aunt over at Carmody just now. You'll\nhave to be careful how you behave yourself, though. Mrs. Barry is a\nvery particular woman. She won't let Diana play with any little girl who\nisn't nice and good.\"\nAnne looked at Marilla through the apple blossoms, her eyes aglow with\ninterest.\n\"What is Diana like? Her hair isn't red, is it? Oh, I hope not. It's bad\nenough to have red hair myself, but I positively couldn't endure it in a\nbosom friend.\"\n\"Diana is a very pretty little girl. She has black eyes and hair and\nrosy cheeks. And she is good and smart, which is better than being\npretty.\"\nMarilla was as fond of morals as the Duchess in Wonderland, and was\nfirmly convinced that one should be tacked on to every remark made to a\nchild who was being brought up.\nBut Anne waved the moral inconsequently aside and seized only on the\ndelightful possibilities before it.\n\"Oh, I'm so glad she's pretty. Next to being beautiful oneself--and\nthat's impossible in my case--it would be best to have a beautiful bosom\nfriend. When I lived with Mrs. Thomas she had a bookcase in her sitting\nroom with glass doors. There weren't any books in it; Mrs. Thomas kept\nher best china and her preserves there--when she had any preserves to\nkeep. One of the doors was broken. Mr. Thomas smashed it one night\nwhen he was slightly intoxicated. But the other was whole and I used to\npretend that my reflection in it was another little girl who lived in\nit. I called her Katie Maurice, and we were very intimate. I used to\ntalk to her by the hour, especially on Sunday, and tell her everything.\nKatie was the comfort and consolation of my life. We used to pretend\nthat the bookcase was enchanted and that if I only knew the spell I\ncould open the door and step right into the room where Katie Maurice\nlived, instead of into Mrs. Thomas' shelves of preserves and china. And\nthen Katie Maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a\nwonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have\nlived there happy for ever after. When I went to live with Mrs. Hammond\nit just broke my heart to leave Katie Maurice. She felt it dreadfully,\ntoo, I know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye\nthrough the bookcase door. There was no bookcase at Mrs. Hammond's. But\njust up the river a little way from the house there was a long green\nlittle valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. It echoed back every\nword you said, even if you didn't talk a bit loud. So I imagined that it\nwas a little girl called Violetta and we were great friends and I loved\nher almost as well as I loved Katie Maurice--not quite, but almost, you\nknow. The night before I went to the asylum I said good-bye to Violetta,\nand oh, her good-bye came back to me in such sad, sad tones. I had\nbecome so attached to her that I hadn't the heart to imagine a bosom\nfriend at the asylum, even if there had been any scope for imagination\nthere.\"\n\"I think it's just as well there wasn't,\" said Marilla drily. \"I\ndon't approve of such goings-on. You seem to half believe your own\nimaginations. It will be well for you to have a real live friend to\nput such nonsense out of your head. But don't let Mrs. Barry hear you\ntalking about your Katie Maurices and your Violettas or she'll think you\ntell stories.\"",

Go to your room and finish learning\nit well, and stay there until I call you down to help me get tea.\"\n\"Can I take the apple blossoms with me for company?\" pleaded Anne.\n\"No; you don't want your room cluttered up with flowers. You should have\nleft them on the tree in the first place.\"\n\"I did feel a little that way, too,\" said Anne. \"I kind of felt I\nshouldn't shorten their lovely lives by picking them--I wouldn't want\nto be picked if I were an apple blossom.

What do you do when you meet with an irresistible\ntemptation?\"\n\"Anne, did you hear me tell you to go to your room?\"\nAnne sighed, retreated to the east gable, and sat down in a chair by the\nwindow.\n\"There--I know this prayer. I learned that last sentence coming\nupstairs. Now I'm going to imagine things into this room so that they'll\nalways stay imagined. The floor is covered with a white velvet carpet\nwith pink roses all over it and there are pink silk curtains at the\nwindows. The walls are hung with gold and silver brocade tapestry. The\nfurniture is mahogany. I never saw any mahogany, but it does sound _so_\nluxurious. This is a couch all heaped with gorgeous silken cushions,\npink and blue and crimson and gold, and I am reclining gracefully on it.\nI can see my reflection in that splendid big mirror hanging on the wall.\nI am tall and regal, clad in a gown of trailing white lace, with a\npearl cross on my breast and pearls in my hair. My hair is of midnight\ndarkness and my skin is a clear ivory pallor. My name is the Lady\nCordelia Fitzgerald. No, it isn't--I can't make _that_ seem real.\"\nShe danced up to the little looking-glass and peered into it. Her\npointed freckled face and solemn gray eyes peered back at her.\n\"You're only Anne of Green Gables,\" she said earnestly, \"and I see you,\njust as you are looking now, whenever I try to imagine I'm the Lady\nCordelia. But it's a million times nicer to be Anne of Green Gables than\nAnne of nowhere in particular, isn't it?\"\nShe bent forward, kissed her reflection affectionately, and betook\nherself to the open window.\n\"Dear Snow Queen, good afternoon. And good afternoon dear birches down\nin the hollow. And good afternoon, dear gray house up on the hill. I\nwonder if Diana is to be my bosom friend. I hope she will, and I shall\nlove her very much. But I must never quite forget Katie Maurice\nand Violetta. They would feel so hurt if I did and I'd hate to hurt\nanybody's feelings, even a little bookcase girl's or a little echo\ngirl's. I must be careful to remember them and send them a kiss every\nday.\"\nAnne blew a couple of airy kisses from her fingertips past the cherry\nblossoms and then, with her chin in her hands, drifted luxuriously out\non a sea of daydreams.",

When details were exhausted Mrs. Rachel introduced the\nreal reason of her call.\n\"I've been hearing some surprising things about you and Matthew.\"\n\"I don't suppose you are any more surprised than I am myself,\" said\nMarilla. \"I'm getting over my surprise now.\"\n\"It was too bad there was such a mistake,\" said Mrs. Rachel\nsympathetically. \"Couldn't you have sent her back?\"\n\"I suppose we could, but we decided not to. Matthew took a fancy to her.\nAnd I must say I like her myself--although I admit she has her faults.\nThe house seems a different place already. She's a real bright little\nthing.\"\nMarilla said more than she had intended to say when she began, for she\nread disapproval in Mrs. Rachel's expression.\n\"It's a great responsibility you've taken on yourself,\" said that\nlady gloomily, \"especially when you've never had any experience with\nchildren. You don't know much about her or her real disposition, I\nsuppose, and there's no guessing how a child like that will turn out.\nBut I don't want to discourage you I'm sure, Marilla.\"\n\"I'm not feeling discouraged,\" was Marilla's dry response, \"when I make\nup my mind to do a thing it stays made up. I suppose you'd like to see\nAnne. I'll call her in.\"\nAnne came running in presently, her face sparkling with the delight of\nher orchard rovings; but, abashed at finding the delight herself in\nthe unexpected presence of a stranger, she halted confusedly inside\nthe door. She certainly was an odd-looking little creature in the short",

Then Marilla suddenly became aware of an\nuncomfortable and rebuking consciousness that she felt more humiliation\nover this than sorrow over the discovery of such a serious defect\nin Anne's disposition. And how was she to punish her? The amiable\nsuggestion of the birch switch--to the efficiency of which all of Mrs.\nRachel's own children could have borne smarting testimony--did not\nappeal to Marilla. She did not believe she could whip a child. No,\nsome other method of punishment must be found to bring Anne to a proper\nrealization of the enormity of her offense.\nMarilla found Anne face downward on her bed, crying bitterly, quite\noblivious of muddy boots on a clean counterpane.\n\"Anne,\" she said not ungently.\nNo answer.\n\"Anne,\" with greater severity, \"get off that bed this minute and listen\nto what I have to say to you.\"\nAnne squirmed off the bed and sat rigidly on a chair beside it, her face\nswollen and tear-stained and her eyes fixed stubbornly on the floor.\n\"This is a nice way for you to behave. Anne! Aren't you ashamed of\nyourself?\"\n\"She hadn't any right to call me ugly and redheaded,\" retorted Anne,\nevasive and defiant.\n\"You hadn't any right to fly into such a fury and talk the way you did\nto her, Anne. I was ashamed of you--thoroughly ashamed of you. I\nwanted you to behave nicely to Mrs. Lynde, and instead of that you have\ndisgraced me. I'm sure I don't know why you should lose your temper like\nthat just because Mrs. Lynde said you were red-haired and homely. You\nsay it yourself often enough.\"\n\"Oh, but there's such a difference between saying a thing yourself and\nhearing other people say it,\" wailed Anne. \"You may know a thing is\nso, but you can't help hoping other people don't quite think it is. I\nsuppose you think I have an awful temper, but I couldn't help it. When\nshe said those things something just rose right up in me and choked me.\nI _had_ to fly out at her.\"\n\"Well, you made a fine exhibition of yourself I must say. Mrs. Lynde\nwill have a nice story to tell about you everywhere--and she'll tell\nit, too. It was a dreadful thing for you to lose your temper like that,\nAnne.\"\n\"Just imagine how you would feel if somebody told you to your face that\nyou were skinny and ugly,\" pleaded Anne tearfully.\nAn old remembrance suddenly rose up before Marilla. She had been a very\nsmall child when she had heard one aunt say of her to another, \"What a\npity she is such a dark, homely little thing.\" Marilla was every day of\nfifty before the sting had gone out of that memory.\n\"I don't say that I think Mrs. Lynde was exactly right in saying what\nshe did to you, Anne,\" she admitted in a softer tone. \"Rachel is too\noutspoken. But that is no excuse for such behavior on your part. She\nwas a stranger and an elderly person and my visitor--all three very good\nreasons why you should have been respectful to her. You were rude and\nsaucy and\"--Marilla had a saving inspiration of punishment--\"you must go\nto her and tell her you are very sorry for your bad temper and ask her\nto forgive you.\"\n\"I can never do that,\" said Anne determinedly and darkly. \"You can\npunish me in any way you like, Marilla. You can shut me up in a dark,\ndamp dungeon inhabited by snakes and toads and feed me only on bread and\nwater and I shall not complain. But I cannot ask Mrs. Lynde to forgive\nme.\"\n\"We're not in the habit of shutting people up in dark damp dungeons,\"\nsaid Marilla drily, \"especially as they're rather scarce in Avonlea. But\napologize to Mrs. Lynde you must and shall and you'll stay here in your\nroom until you can tell me you're willing to do it.\"\n\"I shall have to stay here forever then,\" said Anne mournfully, \"because\nI can't tell Mrs. Lynde I'm sorry I said those things to her. How can\nI? I'm _not_ sorry. I'm sorry I've vexed you; but I'm _glad_ I told her just\nwhat I did. It was a great satisfaction. I can't say I'm sorry when I'm\nnot, can I? I can't even _imagine_ I'm sorry.\"\n\"Perhaps your imagination will be in better working order by the\nmorning,\" said Marilla, rising to depart. \"You'll have the night to\nthink over your conduct in and come to a better frame of mind. You said\nyou would try to be a very good girl if we kept you at Green Gables, but\nI must say it hasn't seemed very much like it this evening.\"\nLeaving this Parthian shaft to rankle in Anne's stormy bosom, Marilla\ndescended to the kitchen, grievously troubled in mind and vexed in\nsoul. She was as angry with herself as with Anne, because, whenever she\nrecalled Mrs. Rachel's dumbfounded countenance her lips twitched with\namusement and she felt a most reprehensible desire to laugh.",

As\na general thing Matthew gravitated between the kitchen and the little\nbedroom off the hall where he slept; once in a while he ventured\nuncomfortably into the parlor or sitting room when the minister came to\ntea. But he had never been upstairs in his own house since the spring he\nhelped Marilla paper the spare bedroom, and that was four years ago.\nHe tiptoed along the hall and stood for several minutes outside the\ndoor of the east gable before he summoned courage to tap on it with his\nfingers and then open the door to peep in.\nAnne was sitting on the yellow chair by the window gazing mournfully out\ninto the garden. Very small and unhappy she looked, and Matthew's heart\nsmote him. He softly closed the door and tiptoed over to her.\n\"Anne,\" he whispered, as if afraid of being overheard, \"how are you\nmaking it, Anne?\"\nAnne smiled wanly.\n\"Pretty well. I imagine a good deal, and that helps to pass the time. Of\ncourse, it's rather lonesome. But then, I may as well get used to that.\"\nAnne smiled again, bravely facing the long years of solitary\nimprisonment before her.\nMatthew recollected that he must say what he had come to say without\nloss of time, lest Marilla return prematurely. \"Well now, Anne, don't\nyou think you'd better do it and have it over with?\" he whispered.\n\"It'll have to be done sooner or later, you know, for Marilla's a\ndreadful deter-mined woman--dreadful determined, Anne. Do it right off,\nI say, and have it over.\"\n\"Do you mean apologize to Mrs. Lynde?\"\n\"Yes--apologize--that's the very word,\" said Matthew eagerly. \"Just\nsmooth it over so to speak. That's what I was trying to get at.\"\n\"I suppose I could do it to oblige you,\" said Anne thoughtfully. \"It\nwould be true enough to say I am sorry, because I _am_ sorry now. I wasn't\na bit sorry last night. I was mad clear through, and I stayed mad all\nnight. I know I did because I woke up three times and I was just\nfurious every time. But this morning it was over. I wasn't in a temper\nanymore--and it left a dreadful sort of goneness, too. I felt so ashamed\nof myself. But I just couldn't think of going and telling Mrs. Lynde\nso. It would be so humiliating. I made up my mind I'd stay shut up here\nforever rather than do that. But still--I'd do anything for you--if you\nreally want me to--\"\n\"Well now, of course I do. It's terrible lonesome downstairs without\nyou. Just go and smooth things over--that's a good girl.\"\n\"Very well,\" said Anne resignedly. \"I'll tell Marilla as soon as she\ncomes in I've repented.\"\n\"That's right--that's right, Anne. But don't tell Marilla I said\nanything about it. She might think I was putting my oar in and I\npromised not to do that.\"\n\"Wild horses won't drag the secret from me,\" promised Anne solemnly.\n\"How would wild horses drag a secret from a person anyhow?\"\nBut Matthew was gone, scared at his own success. He fled hastily to the\nremotest corner of the horse pasture lest Marilla should suspect what",

You must just imagine it. I behaved terribly to\nyou--and I've disgraced the dear friends, Matthew and Marilla, who have\nlet me stay at Green Gables although I'm not a boy. I'm a dreadfully\nwicked and ungrateful girl, and I deserve to be punished and cast out\nby respectable people forever. It was very wicked of me to fly into a\ntemper because you told me the truth. It _was_ the truth; every word you\nsaid was true. My hair is red and I'm freckled and skinny and ugly.\nWhat I said to you was true, too, but I shouldn't have said it. Oh, Mrs.\nLynde, please, please, forgive me. If you refuse it will be a lifelong\nsorrow on a poor little orphan girl, would you, even if she had a\ndreadful temper? Oh, I am sure you wouldn't. Please say you forgive me,\nMrs. Lynde.\"\nAnne clasped her hands together, bowed her head, and waited for the word\nof judgment.\nThere was no mistaking her sincerity--it breathed in every tone of her\nvoice. Both Marilla and Mrs. Lynde recognized its unmistakable ring.\nBut the former under-stood in dismay that Anne was actually enjoying\nher valley of humiliation--was reveling in the thoroughness of her\nabasement. Where was the wholesome punishment upon which she, Marilla,\nhad plumed herself? Anne had turned it into a species of positive\npleasure.\nGood Mrs. Lynde, not being overburdened with perception, did not see\nthis. She only perceived that Anne had made a very thorough apology and\nall resentment vanished from her kindly, if somewhat officious, heart.\n\"There, there, get up, child,\" she said heartily. \"Of course I forgive\nyou. I guess I was a little too hard on you, anyway. But I'm such an\noutspoken person. You just mustn't mind me, that's what. It can't be\ndenied your hair is terrible red; but I knew a girl once--went to school\nwith her, in fact--whose hair was every mite as red as yours when she\nwas young, but when she grew up it darkened to a real handsome auburn. I\nwouldn't be a mite surprised if yours did, too--not a mite.\"\n\"Oh, Mrs. Lynde!\" Anne drew a long breath as she rose to her feet. \"You\nhave given me a hope. I shall always feel that you are a benefactor. Oh,\nI could endure anything if I only thought my hair would be a handsome\nauburn when I grew up. It would be so much easier to be good if one's",

I pity it because it isn't beautiful.\"\n\"Handsome is as handsome does,\" quoted Marilla. \"I've had that said\nto me before, but I have my doubts about it,\" remarked skeptical Anne,\nsniffing at her narcissi. \"Oh, aren't these flowers sweet!

A little gypsy\nwind came down it to meet them, laden with the spicy perfume of young\ndew-wet ferns. Far up in the shadows a cheerful light gleamed out\nthrough the trees from the kitchen at Green Gables. Anne suddenly came\nclose to Marilla and slipped her hand into the older woman's hard palm.\n\"It's lovely to be going home and know it's home,\" she said. \"I love\nGreen Gables already, and I never loved any place before. No place ever\nseemed like home. Oh, Marilla, I'm so happy. I could pray right now and\nnot find it a bit hard.\"\nSomething warm and pleasant welled up in Marilla's heart at touch of\nthat thin little hand in her own--a throb of the maternity she had\nmissed, perhaps. Its very unaccustomedness and sweetness disturbed\nher. She hastened to restore her sensations to their normal calm by\ninculcating a moral.\n\"If you'll be a good girl you'll always be happy, Anne. And you should\nnever find it hard to say your prayers.\"\n\"Saying one's prayers isn't exactly the same thing as praying,\" said\nAnne meditatively. \"But I'm going to imagine that I'm the wind that is\nblowing up there in those tree tops. When I get tired of the trees I'll\nimagine I'm gently waving down here in the ferns--and then I'll fly over\nto Mrs. Lynde's garden and set the flowers dancing--and then I'll go\nwith one great swoop over the clover field--and then I'll blow over the\nLake of Shining Waters and ripple it all up into little sparkling waves.\nOh, there's so much scope for imagination in a wind! So I'll not talk\nany more just now, Marilla.\"\n\"Thanks be to goodness for that,\" breathed Marilla in devout relief.",

One was of snuffy colored gingham which\nMarilla had been tempted to buy from a peddler the preceding summer\nbecause it looked so serviceable; one was of black-and-white checkered\nsateen which she had picked up at a bargain counter in the winter; and\none was a stiff print of an ugly blue shade which she had purchased that\nweek at a Carmody store.\nShe had made them up herself, and they were all made alike--plain skirts\nfulled tightly to plain waists, with sleeves as plain as waist and skirt\nand tight as sleeves could be.\n\"I'll imagine that I like them,\" said Anne soberly.\n\"I don't want you to imagine it,\" said Marilla, offended. \"Oh, I can see\nyou don't like the dresses! What is the matter with them? Aren't they\nneat and clean and new?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then why don't you like them?\"\n\"They're--they're not--pretty,\" said Anne reluctantly.\n\"Pretty!\" Marilla sniffed. \"I didn't trouble my head about getting\npretty dresses for you. I don't believe in pampering vanity, Anne, I'll\ntell you that right off. Those dresses are good, sensible, serviceable\ndresses, without any frills or furbelows about them, and they're all\nyou'll get this summer. The brown gingham and the blue print will do\nyou for school when you begin to go. The sateen is for church and Sunday\nschool. I'll expect you to keep them neat and clean and not to tear\nthem. I should think you'd be grateful to get most anything after those\nskimpy wincey things you've been wearing.\"\n\"Oh, I _am_ grateful,\" protested Anne. \"But I'd be ever so much\ngratefuller if--if you'd made just one of them with puffed sleeves.\nPuffed sleeves are so fashionable now. It would give me such a thrill,\nMarilla, just to wear a dress with puffed sleeves.\"\n\"Well, you'll have to do without your thrill. I hadn't any material\nto waste on puffed sleeves. I think they are ridiculous-looking things\nanyhow. I prefer the plain, sensible ones.\"\n\"But I'd rather look ridiculous when everybody else does than plain and\nsensible all by myself,\" persisted Anne mournfully.\n\"Trust you for that! Well, hang those dresses carefully up in your\ncloset, and then sit down and learn the Sunday school lesson. I got\na quarterly from Mr. Bell for you and you'll go to Sunday school\ntomorrow,\" said Marilla, disappearing downstairs in high dudgeon.",

Her wreath having faded, Anne had discarded it in the lane,\nso Marilla was spared the knowledge of that for a time.\n\"I didn't like it a bit. It was horrid.\"\n\"Anne Shirley!\" said Marilla rebukingly.\nAnne sat down on the rocker with a long sigh, kissed one of Bonny's\nleaves, and waved her hand to a blossoming fuchsia.\n\"They might have been lonesome while I was away,\" she explained. \"And\nnow about the Sunday school. I behaved well, just as you told me. Mrs.\nLynde was gone, but I went right on myself. I went into the church, with\na lot of other little girls, and I sat in the corner of a pew by the\nwindow while the opening exercises went on. Mr. Bell made an awfully\nlong prayer. I would have been dreadfully tired before he got through\nif I hadn't been sitting by that window. But it looked right out on the\nLake of Shining Waters, so I just gazed at that and imagined all sorts\nof splendid things.\"\n\"You shouldn't have done anything of the sort. You should have listened\nto Mr. Bell.\"\n\"But he wasn't talking to me,\" protested Anne. \"He was talking to God\nand he didn't seem to be very much inter-ested in it, either. I think\nhe thought God was too far off though. There was a long row of white\nbirches hanging over the lake and the sunshine fell down through\nthem, 'way, 'way down, deep into the water. Oh, Marilla, it was like a\nbeautiful dream! It gave me a thrill and I just said, 'Thank you for it,\nGod,' two or three times.\"\n\"Not out loud, I hope,\" said Marilla anxiously.\n\"Oh, no, just under my breath. Well, Mr. Bell did get through at last\nand they told me to go into the classroom with Miss Rogerson's class.\nThere were nine other girls in it. They all had puffed sleeves. I tried\nto imagine mine were puffed, too, but I couldn't. Why couldn't I? It was\nas easy as could be to imagine they were puffed when I was alone in\nthe east gable, but it was awfully hard there among the others who had\nreally truly puffs.\"\n\"You shouldn't have been thinking about your sleeves in Sunday school.\nYou should have been attending to the lesson. I hope you knew it.\"\n\"Oh, yes; and I answered a lot of questions. Miss Rogerson asked ever so\nmany. I don't think it was fair for her to do all the asking. There were\nlots I wanted to ask her, but I didn't like to because I didn't think\nshe was a kindred spirit. Then all the other little girls recited a\nparaphrase. She asked me if I knew any. I told her I didn't, but I could\nrecite, 'The Dog at His Master's Grave' if she liked. That's in the\nThird Royal Reader. It isn't a really truly religious piece of poetry,\nbut it's so sad and melancholy that it might as well be. She said it\nwouldn't do and she told me to learn the nineteenth paraphrase for next\nSunday. I read it over in church afterwards and it's splendid. There are\ntwo lines in particular that just thrill me.\n\"'Quick as the slaughtered squadrons fell\nIn Midian's evil day.'\n\"I don't know what 'squadrons' means nor 'Midian,' either, but it sounds\n_so_ tragical. I can hardly wait until next Sunday to recite it.\nI'll practice it all the week. After Sunday school I asked Miss\nRogerson--because Mrs. Lynde was too far away--to show me your pew.\nI sat just as still as I could and the text was Revelations, third\nchapter, second and third verses. It was a very long text. If I was a\nminister I'd pick the short, snappy ones. The sermon was awfully long,\ntoo. I suppose the minister had to match it to the text. I didn't think\nhe was a bit interesting. The trouble with him seems to be that he\nhasn't enough imagination. I didn't listen to him very much. I just let",

It was putting flowers on your hat at all,\nno matter what color they were, that was ridiculous. You are the most\naggravating child!\"\n\"I don't see why it's any more ridiculous to wear flowers on your hat\nthan on your dress,\" protested Anne. \"Lots of little girls there had\nbouquets pinned on their dresses. What's the difference?\"\nMarilla was not to be drawn from the safe concrete into dubious paths of\nthe abstract.\n\"Don't answer me back like that, Anne. It was very silly of you to do\nsuch a thing. Never let me catch you at such a trick again. Mrs. Rachel\nsays she thought she would sink through the floor when she saw you come\nin all rigged out like that. She couldn't get near enough to tell you\nto take them off till it was too late. She says people talked about it\nsomething dreadful. Of course they would think I had no better sense\nthan to let you go decked out like that.\"\n\"Oh, I'm so sorry,\" said Anne, tears welling into her eyes. \"I never\nthought you'd mind. The roses and buttercups were so sweet and pretty\nI thought they'd look lovely on my hat. Lots of the little girls had\nartificial flowers on their hats. I'm afraid I'm going to be a dreadful\ntrial to you. Maybe you'd better send me back to the asylum. That would\nbe terrible; I don't think I could endure it; most likely I would go\ninto consumption; I'm so thin as it is, you see. But that would be\nbetter than being a trial to you.\"\n\"Nonsense,\" said Marilla, vexed at herself for having made the child\ncry. \"I don't want to send you back to the asylum, I'm sure. All I want\nis that you should behave like other little girls and not make yourself\nridiculous. Don't cry any more. I've got some news for you. Diana Barry\ncame home this afternoon. I'm going up to see if I can borrow a skirt\npattern from Mrs. Barry, and if you like you can come with me and get\nacquainted with Diana.\"\nAnne rose to her feet, with clasped hands, the tears still glistening on\nher cheeks; the dish towel she had been hemming slipped unheeded to the\nfloor.",

It will be better\nfor you than straining your eyes over that book. She reads entirely\ntoo much--\" this to Marilla as the little girls went out--\"and I can't\nprevent her, for her father aids and abets her. She's always poring over\na book.

It was\nencircled by huge old willows and tall firs, beneath which flourished\nflowers that loved the shade. Prim, right-angled paths neatly bordered\nwith clamshells, intersected it like moist red ribbons and in the beds\nbetween old-fashioned flowers ran riot. There were rosy bleeding-hearts\nand great splendid crimson peonies; white, fragrant narcissi and thorny,\nsweet Scotch roses; pink and blue and white columbines and lilac-tinted\nBouncing Bets; clumps of southernwood and ribbon grass and mint; purple\nAdam-and-Eve, daffodils, and masses of sweet clover white with its\ndelicate, fragrant, feathery sprays; scarlet lightning that shot\nits fiery lances over prim white musk-flowers; a garden it was where\nsunshine lingered and bees hummed, and winds, beguiled into loitering,\npurred and rustled.",

            "text": "When Marilla and Anne went home Diana went with them as far as the log\nbridge. The two little girls walked with their arms about each other.\nAt the brook they parted with many promises to spend the next afternoon\ntogether.\n\"Well, did you find Diana a kindred spirit?\" asked Marilla as they went\nup through the garden of Green Gables.\n\"Oh yes,\" sighed Anne, blissfully unconscious of any sarcasm on\nMarilla's part. \"Oh Marilla, I'm the happiest girl on Prince Edward\nIsland this very moment. I assure you I'll say my prayers with a right\ngood-will tonight. Diana and I are going to build a playhouse in Mr.\nWilliam Bell's birch grove tomorrow. Can I have those broken pieces of\nchina that are out in the woodshed? Diana's birthday is in February and\nmine is in March. Don't you think that is a very strange coincidence?\nDiana is going to lend me a book to read. She says it's perfectly\nsplendid and tremendously exciting. She's going to show me a place back\nin the woods where rice lilies grow. Don't you think Diana has got very\nsoulful eyes? I wish I had soulful eyes. Diana is going to teach me to\nsing a song called 'Nelly in the Hazel Dell.' She's going to give me a\npicture to put up in my room; it's a perfectly beautiful picture, she\nsays--a lovely lady in a pale blue silk dress. A sewing-machine agent\ngave it to her. I wish I had something to give Diana. I'm an inch taller\nthan Diana, but she is ever so much fatter; she says she'd like to be\nthin because it's so much more graceful, but I'm afraid she only said\nit to soothe my feelings. We're going to the shore some day to gather\nshells. We have agreed to call the spring down by the log bridge the\nDryad's Bubble. Isn't that a perfectly elegant name? I read a story\nonce about a spring called that. A dryad is sort of a grown-up fairy, I\nthink.\"\n\"Well, all I hope is you won't talk Diana to death,\" said Marilla. \"But\nremember this in all your planning, Anne. You're not going to play all\nthe time nor most of it. You'll have your work to do and it'll have to\nbe done first.\"\nAnne's cup of happiness was full, and Matthew caused it to overflow. He\nhad just got home from a trip to the store at Carmody, and he sheepishly\nproduced a small parcel from his pocket and handed it to Anne, with a\ndeprecatory look at Marilla.\n\"I heard you say you liked chocolate sweeties, so I got you some,\" he\nsaid.\n\"Humph,\" sniffed Marilla. \"It'll ruin her teeth and stomach. There,\nthere, child, don't look so dismal. You can eat those, since Matthew\nhas gone and got them. He'd better have brought you peppermints. They're\nwholesomer. Don't sicken yourself eating all them at once now.\"\n\"Oh, no, indeed, I won't,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'll just eat one\ntonight, Marilla. And I can give Diana half of them, can't I? The\nother half will taste twice as sweet to me if I give some to her. It's\ndelightful to think I have something to give her.\"\n\"I will say it for the child,\" said Marilla when Anne had gone to\nher gable, \"she isn't stingy. I'm glad, for of all faults I detest\nstinginess in a child. Dear me, it's only three weeks since she came,\nand it seems as if she'd been here always. I can't imagine the place\nwithout her. Now, don't be looking I told-you-so, Matthew. That's bad\nenough in a woman, but it isn't to be endured in a man. I'm perfectly\nwilling to own up that I'm glad I consented to keep the child and that\nI'm getting fond of her, but don't you rub it in, Matthew Cuthbert.\"",

But of course\nI'd rather be Anne of Green Gables sewing patchwork than Anne of any\nother place with nothing to do but play. I wish time went as quick\nsewing patches as it does when I'm playing with Diana, though. Oh, we\ndo have such elegant times, Marilla. I have to furnish most of the\nimagination, but I'm well able to do that. Diana is simply perfect in\nevery other way. You know that little piece of land across the brook\nthat runs up between our farm and Mr. Barry's. It belongs to Mr. William\nBell, and right in the corner there is a little ring of white birch\ntrees--the most romantic spot, Marilla. Diana and I have our playhouse\nthere. We call it Idlewild. Isn't that a poetical name? I assure you it\ntook me some time to think it out. I stayed awake nearly a whole night\nbefore I invented it. Then, just as I was dropping off to sleep, it came\nlike an inspiration. Diana was _enraptured_ when she heard it. We have got\nour house fixed up elegantly. You must come and see it, Marilla--won't\nyou? We have great big stones, all covered with moss, for seats, and\nboards from tree to tree for shelves. And we have all our dishes on\nthem. Of course, they're all broken but it's the easiest thing in the\nworld to imagine that they are whole. There's a piece of a plate with a\nspray of red and yellow ivy on it that is especially beautiful. We keep\nit in the parlor and we have the fairy glass there, too. The fairy glass\nis as lovely as a dream. Diana found it out in the woods behind their\nchicken house. It's all full of rainbows--just little young rainbows\nthat haven't grown big yet--and Diana's mother told her it was broken\noff a hanging lamp they once had. But it's nice to imagine the fairies\nlost it one night when they had a ball, so we call it the fairy glass.\nMatthew is going to make us a table. Oh, we have named that little round\npool over in Mr. Barry's field Willowmere. I got that name out of the\nbook Diana lent me. That was a thrilling book, Marilla. The heroine\nhad five lovers. I'd be satisfied with one, wouldn't you? She was very\nhandsome and she went through great tribulations. She could faint as\neasy as anything. I'd love to be able to faint, wouldn't you, Marilla?\nIt's so romantic. But I'm really very healthy for all I'm so thin. I\nbelieve I'm getting fatter, though. Don't you think I am? I look at my\nelbows every morning when I get up to see if any dimples are coming.\nDiana is having a new dress made with elbow sleeves. She is going to\nwear it to the picnic. Oh, I do hope it will be fine next Wednesday. I\ndon't feel that I could endure the disappointment if anything happened\nto prevent me from getting to the picnic. I suppose I'd live through it,\nbut I'm certain it would be a lifelong sorrow. It wouldn't matter if\nI got to a hundred picnics in after years; they wouldn't make up for\nmissing this one. They're going to have boats on the Lake of Shining\nWaters--and ice cream, as I told you. I have never tasted ice cream.\nDiana tried to explain what it was like, but I guess ice cream is one of\nthose things that are beyond imagination.\"",

I thought I stuck it in my pincushion when I came\nhome from church yesterday evening, but I can't find it anywhere.\"\n\"I--I saw it this afternoon when you were away at the Aid Society,\" said\nAnne, a little slowly. \"I was passing your door when I saw it on the\ncushion, so I went in to look at it.\"\n\"Did you touch it?\" said Marilla sternly.\n\"Y-e-e-s,\" admitted Anne, \"I took it up and I pinned it on my breast\njust to see how it would look.\"\n\"You had no business to do anything of the sort. It's very wrong in a\nlittle girl to meddle. You shouldn't have gone into my room in the first\nplace and you shouldn't have touched a brooch that didn't belong to you\nin the second. Where did you put it?\"\n\"Oh, I put it back on the bureau. I hadn't it on a minute. Truly, I\ndidn't mean to meddle, Marilla. I didn't think about its being wrong to\ngo in and try on the brooch; but I see now that it was and I'll never\ndo it again. That's one good thing about me. I never do the same naughty\nthing twice.\"\n\"You didn't put it back,\" said Marilla. \"That brooch isn't anywhere on\nthe bureau. You've taken it out or something, Anne.\"\n\"I did put it back,\" said Anne quickly--pertly, Marilla thought. \"I\ndon't just remember whether I stuck it on the pincushion or laid it in\nthe china tray. But I'm perfectly certain I put it back.\"\n\"I'll go and have another look,\" said Marilla, determining to be just.\n\"If you put that brooch back it's there still. If it isn't I'll know you\ndidn't, that's all!\"\nMarilla went to her room and made a thorough search, not only over the\nbureau but in every other place she thought the brooch might possibly\nbe. It was not to be found and she returned to the kitchen.\n\"Anne, the brooch is gone. By your own admission you were the last\nperson to handle it. Now, what have you done with it? Tell me the truth\nat once. Did you take it out and lose it?\"\n\"No, I didn't,\" said Anne solemnly, meeting Marilla's angry gaze\nsquarely. \"I never took the brooch out of your room and that is the\ntruth, if I was to be led to the block for it--although I'm not very\ncertain what a block is. So there, Marilla.\"\nAnne's \"so there\" was only intended to emphasize her assertion, but\nMarilla took it as a display of defiance.\n\"I believe you are telling me a falsehood, Anne,\" she said sharply. \"I\nknow you are. There now, don't say anything more unless you are prepared\nto tell the whole truth. Go to your room and stay there until you are\nready to confess.\"\n\"Will I take the peas with me?\" said Anne meekly.\n\"No, I'll finish shelling them myself. Do as I bid you.\"\nWhen Anne had gone Marilla went about her evening tasks in a very\ndisturbed state of mind. She was worried about her valuable brooch. What\nif Anne had lost it? And how wicked of the child to deny having taken\nit, when anybody could see she must have! With such an innocent face,\ntoo!\n\"I don't know what I wouldn't sooner have had happen,\" thought Marilla,\nas she nervously shelled the peas. \"Of course, I don't suppose she meant\nto steal it or anything like that. She's just taken it to play with\nor help along that imagination of hers. She must have taken it, that's\nclear, for there hasn't been a soul in that room since she was in it, by\nher own story, until I went up tonight. And the brooch is gone, there's\nnothing surer. I suppose she has lost it and is afraid to own up for\nfear she'll be punished. It's a dreadful thing to think she tells\nfalsehoods. It's a far worse thing than her fit of temper. It's a\nfearful responsibility to have a child in your house you can't trust.\nSlyness and untruthfulness--that's what she has displayed. I declare I\nfeel worse about that than about the brooch. If she'd only have told the\ntruth about it I wouldn't mind so much.\"",

            "text": "Wednesday morning dawned as bright and fair as if expressly made to\norder for the picnic. Birds sang around Green Gables; the Madonna lilies\nin the garden sent out whiffs of perfume that entered in on viewless\nwinds at every door and window, and wandered through halls and rooms\nlike spirits of benediction. The birches in the hollow waved joyful\nhands as if watching for Anne's usual morning greeting from the east\ngable. But Anne was not at her window. When Marilla took her breakfast\nup to her she found the child sitting primly on her bed, pale and\nresolute, with tight-shut lips and gleaming eyes.\n\"Marilla, I'm ready to confess.\"\n\"Ah!\" Marilla laid down her tray. Once again her method had succeeded;\nbut her success was very bitter to her. \"Let me hear what you have to\nsay then, Anne.\"\n\"I took the amethyst brooch,\" said Anne, as if repeating a lesson she\nhad learned. \"I took it just as you said. I didn't mean to take it when\nI went in. But it did look so beautiful, Marilla, when I pinned it on my\nbreast that I was overcome by an irresistible temptation. I imagined how\nperfectly thrilling it would be to take it to Idlewild and play I was\nthe Lady Cordelia Fitzgerald. It would be so much easier to imagine I\nwas the Lady Cordelia if I had a real amethyst brooch on. Diana and\nI make necklaces of roseberries but what are roseberries compared to\namethysts? So I took the brooch. I thought I could put it back before\nyou came home. I went all the way around by the road to lengthen out the\ntime. When I was going over the bridge across the Lake of Shining Waters\nI took the brooch off to have another look at it. Oh, how it did shine\nin the sunlight! And then, when I was leaning over the bridge, it\njust slipped through my fingers--so--and went down--down--down, all\npurply-sparkling, and sank forevermore beneath the Lake of Shining\nWaters. And that's the best I can do at confessing, Marilla.\"\nMarilla felt hot anger surge up into her heart again. This child had\ntaken and lost her treasured amethyst brooch and now sat there calmly\nreciting the details thereof without the least apparent compunction or\nrepentance.\n\"Anne, this is terrible,\" she said, trying to speak calmly. \"You are the\nvery wickedest girl I ever heard of.\"\n\"Yes, I suppose I am,\" agreed Anne tranquilly. \"And I know I'll have to\nbe punished. It'll be your duty to punish me, Marilla. Won't you please\nget it over right off because I'd like to go to the picnic with nothing\non my mind.\"\n\"Picnic, indeed! You'll go to no picnic today, Anne Shirley. That shall\nbe your punishment. And it isn't half severe enough either for what\nyou've done!\"\n\"Not go to the picnic!\" Anne sprang to her feet and clutched Marilla's\nhand. \"But you _promised_ me I might! Oh, Marilla, I must go to the\npicnic. That was why I confessed. Punish me any way you like but that.\nOh, Marilla, please, please, let me go to the picnic. Think of the ice\ncream! For anything you know I may never have a chance to taste ice\ncream again.\"\nMarilla disengaged Anne's clinging hands stonily.\n\"You needn't plead, Anne. You are not going to the picnic and that's\nfinal. No, not a word.\"\nAnne realized that Marilla was not to be moved. She clasped her hands\ntogether, gave a piercing shriek, and then flung herself face\ndownward on the bed, crying and writhing in an utter abandonment of\ndisappointment and despair.\n\"For the land's sake!\" gasped Marilla, hastening from the room. \"I\nbelieve the child is crazy. No child in her senses would behave as she\ndoes. If she isn't she's utterly bad. Oh dear, I'm afraid Rachel was\nright from the first. But I've put my hand to the plow and I won't look\nback.\"\nThat was a dismal morning. Marilla worked fiercely and scrubbed the\nporch floor and the dairy shelves when she could find nothing else to\ndo. Neither the shelves nor the porch needed it--but Marilla did. Then\nshe went out and raked the yard.\nWhen dinner was ready she went to the stairs and called Anne. A\ntear-stained face appeared, looking tragically over the banisters.\n\"Come down to your dinner, Anne.\"\n\"I don't want any dinner, Marilla,\" said Anne, sobbingly. \"I couldn't\neat anything. My heart is broken. You'll feel remorse of conscience\nsomeday, I expect, for breaking it, Marilla, but I forgive you. Remember\nwhen the time comes that I forgive you. But please don't ask me to eat\nanything, especially boiled pork and greens. Boiled pork and greens are\nso unromantic when one is in affliction.\"\nExasperated, Marilla returned to the kitchen and poured out her tale\nof woe to Matthew, who, between his sense of justice and his unlawful\nsympathy with Anne, was a miserable man.\n\"Well now, she shouldn't have taken the brooch, Marilla, or told stories\nabout it,\" he admitted, mournfully surveying his plateful of unromantic\npork and greens as if he, like Anne, thought it a food unsuited to\ncrises of feeling, \"but she's such a little thing--such an interesting\nlittle thing. Don't you think it's pretty rough not to let her go to the\npicnic when she's so set on it?\"\n\"Matthew Cuthbert, I'm amazed at you. I think I've let her off entirely\ntoo easy. And she doesn't appear to realize how wicked she's been at\nall--that's what worries me most. If she'd really felt sorry it wouldn't\nbe so bad. And you don't seem to realize it, neither; you're making\nexcuses for her all the time to yourself--I can see that.\"\n\"Well now, she's such a little thing,\" feebly reiterated Matthew. \"And\nthere should be allowances made, Marilla. You know she's never had any\nbringing up.\"\n\"Well, she's having it now\" retorted Marilla.\nThe retort silenced Matthew if it did not convince him. That dinner was\na very dismal meal. The only cheerful thing about it was Jerry Buote,\nthe hired boy, and Marilla resented his cheerfulness as a personal\ninsult.\nWhen her dishes were washed and her bread sponge set and her hens fed\nMarilla remembered that she had noticed a small rent in her best black\nlace shawl when she had taken it off on Monday afternoon on returning\nfrom the Ladies' Aid.\nShe would go and mend it. The shawl was in a box in her trunk. As\nMarilla lifted it out, the sunlight, falling through the vines that\nclustered thickly about the window, struck upon something caught in the\nshawl--something that glittered and sparkled in facets of violet light.\nMarilla snatched at it with a gasp. It was the amethyst brooch, hanging\nto a thread of the lace by its catch!\n\"Dear life and heart,\" said Marilla blankly, \"what does this mean?\nHere's my brooch safe and sound that I thought was at the bottom of\nBarry's pond. Whatever did that girl mean by saying she took it and lost\nit? I declare I believe Green Gables is bewitched. I remember now that\nwhen I took off my shawl Monday afternoon I laid it on the bureau for a\nminute. I suppose the brooch got caught in it somehow. Well!\"\nMarilla betook herself to the east gable, brooch in hand. Anne had cried\nherself out and was sitting dejectedly by the window.\n\"Anne Shirley,\" said Marilla solemnly, \"I've just found my brooch\nhanging to my black lace shawl. Now I want to know what that rigmarole\nyou told me this morning meant.\"\n\"Why, you said you'd keep me here until I confessed,\" returned Anne\nwearily, \"and so I decided to confess because I was bound to get to the\npicnic. I thought out a confession last night after I went to bed and\nmade it as interesting as I could. And I said it over and over so that I\nwouldn't forget it. But you wouldn't let me go to the picnic after all,\nso all my trouble was wasted.\"\nMarilla had to laugh in spite of herself. But her conscience pricked\nher.\n\"Anne, you do beat all! But I was wrong--I see that now. I shouldn't\nhave doubted your word when I'd never known you to tell a story.\nOf course, it wasn't right for you to confess to a thing you hadn't\ndone--it was very wrong to do so. But I drove you to it. So if you'll\nforgive me, Anne, I'll forgive you and we'll start square again. And now",

            "text": "WHAT a splendid day!\" said Anne, drawing a long breath. \"Isn't it good\njust to be alive on a day like this? I pity the people who aren't born\nyet for missing it. They may have good days, of course, but they can\nnever have this one. And it's splendider still to have such a lovely way\nto go to school by, isn't it?\"\n\"It's a lot nicer than going round by the road; that is so dusty\nand hot,\" said Diana practically, peeping into her dinner basket and\nmentally calculating if the three juicy, toothsome, raspberry tarts\nreposing there were divided among ten girls how many bites each girl\nwould have.\nThe little girls of Avonlea school always pooled their lunches, and\nto eat three raspberry tarts all alone or even to share them only with\none's best chum would have forever and ever branded as \"awful mean\" the\ngirl who did it. And yet, when the tarts were divided among ten girls\nyou just got enough to tantalize you.\nThe way Anne and Diana went to school _was_ a pretty one. Anne thought\nthose walks to and from school with Diana couldn't be improved upon\neven by imagination. Going around by the main road would have been so\nunromantic; but to go by Lover's Lane and Willowmere and Violet Vale and\nthe Birch Path was romantic, if ever anything was.\nLover's Lane opened out below the orchard at Green Gables and stretched\nfar up into the woods to the end of the Cuthbert farm. It was the way by\nwhich the cows were taken to the back pasture and the wood hauled home\nin winter. Anne had named it Lover's Lane before she had been a month at\nGreen Gables.\n\"Not that lovers ever really walk there,\" she explained to Marilla,\n\"but Diana and I are reading a perfectly magnificent book and there's a\nLover's Lane in it. So we want to have one, too. And it's a very pretty\nname, don't you think? So romantic! We can't imagine the lovers into it,\nyou know. I like that lane because you can think out loud there without\npeople calling you crazy.\"\nAnne, starting out alone in the morning, went down Lover's Lane as far\nas the brook. Here Diana met her, and the two little girls went on\nup the lane under the leafy arch of maples--\"maples are such sociable\ntrees,\" said Anne; \"they're always rustling and whispering to\nyou\"--until they came to a rustic bridge. Then they left the lane\nand walked through Mr. Barry's back field and past Willowmere. Beyond\nWillowmere came Violet Vale--a little green dimple in the shadow of Mr.\nAndrew Bell's big woods. \"Of course there are no violets there now,\"\nAnne told Marilla, \"but Diana says there are millions of them in spring.\nOh, Marilla, can't you just imagine you see them? It actually takes away\nmy breath. I named it Violet Vale. Diana says she never saw the beat\nof me for hitting on fancy names for places. It's nice to be clever at\nsomething, isn't it? But Diana named the Birch Path. She wanted to, so\nI let her; but I'm sure I could have found something more poetical than\nplain Birch Path. Anybody can think of a name like that. But the Birch\nPath is one of the prettiest places in the world, Marilla.\"\nIt was. Other people besides Anne thought so when they stumbled on it.\nIt was a little narrow, twisting path, winding down over a long hill\nstraight through Mr. Bell's woods, where the light came down sifted\nthrough so many emerald screens that it was as flawless as the heart\nof a diamond. It was fringed in all its length with slim young birches,\nwhite stemmed and lissom boughed; ferns and starflowers and wild\nlilies-of-the-valley and scarlet tufts of pigeonberries grew thickly\nalong it; and always there was a delightful spiciness in the air and\nmusic of bird calls and the murmur and laugh of wood winds in the trees\noverhead. Now and then you might see a rabbit skipping across the road\nif you were quiet--which, with Anne and Diana, happened about once in\na blue moon. Down in the valley the path came out to the main road and\nthen it was just up the spruce hill to the school.",

The schoolhouse was set back from the road and behind it was\na dusky fir wood and a brook where all the children put their bottles of\nmilk in the morning to keep cool and sweet until dinner hour.\nMarilla had seen Anne start off to school on the first day of September\nwith many secret misgivings. Anne was such an odd girl. How would she\nget on with the other children? And how on earth would she ever manage\nto hold her tongue during school hours?\nThings went better than Marilla feared, however. Anne came home that\nevening in high spirits.\n\"I think I'm going to like school here,\" she announced. \"I don't think\nmuch of the master, though. He's all the time curling his mustache\nand making eyes at Prissy Andrews. Prissy is grown up, you know. She's\nsixteen and she's studying for the entrance examination into Queen's\nAcademy at Charlottetown next year. Tillie Boulter says the master is\n_dead gone_ on her. She's got a beautiful complexion and curly brown hair\nand she does it up so elegantly. She sits in the long seat at the back\nand he sits there, too, most of the time--to explain her lessons, he\nsays. But Ruby Gillis says she saw him writing something on her slate\nand when Prissy read it she blushed as red as a beet and giggled; and\nRuby Gillis says she doesn't believe it had anything to do with the\nlesson.\"\n\"Anne Shirley, don't let me hear you talking about your teacher in that\nway again,\" said Marilla sharply. \"You don't go to school to criticize\nthe master. I guess he can teach _you_ something, and it's your business\nto learn. And I want you to understand right off that you are not to\ncome home telling tales about him. That is something I won't encourage.\nI hope you were a good girl.\"\n\"Indeed I was,\" said Anne comfortably. \"It wasn't so hard as you might\nimagine, either. I sit with Diana. Our seat is right by the window and\nwe can look down to the Lake of Shining Waters. There are a lot of nice\ngirls in school and we had scrumptious fun playing at dinnertime. It's\nso nice to have a lot of little girls to play with. But of course I like\nDiana best and always will. I _adore_ Diana. I'm dreadfully far behind the\nothers. They're all in the fifth book and I'm only in the fourth. I feel\nthat it's kind of a disgrace. But there's not one of them has such an\nimagination as I have and I soon found that out. We had reading and\ngeography and Canadian history and dictation today. Mr. Phillips said my\nspelling was disgraceful and he held up my slate so that everybody could\nsee it, all marked over. I felt so mortified, Marilla; he might have\nbeen politer to a stranger, I think. Ruby Gillis gave me an apple and\nSophia Sloane lent me a lovely pink card with 'May I see you home?' on\nit. I'm to give it back to her tomorrow. And Tillie Boulter let me wear\nher bead ring all the afternoon. Can I have some of those pearl beads\noff the old pincushion in the garret to make myself a ring? And oh,\nMarilla, Jane Andrews told me that Minnie MacPherson told her that she\nheard Prissy Andrews tell Sara Gillis that I had a very pretty nose.\nMarilla, that is the first compliment I have ever had in my life and you\ncan't imagine what a strange feeling it gave me.

            "text": "a pretty nose? I know you'll tell me the truth.\"\n\"Your nose is well enough,\" said Marilla shortly. Secretly she thought\nAnne's nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of\ntelling her so.\nThat was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. And now, this\ncrisp September morning, Anne and Diana were tripping blithely down the\nBirch Path, two of the happiest little girls in Avonlea.\n\"I guess Gilbert Blythe will be in school today,\" said Diana. \"He's been\nvisiting his cousins over in New Brunswick all summer and he only came\nhome Saturday night. He's _aw'fly_ handsome, Anne. And he teases the\ngirls something terrible. He just torments our lives out.\"\nDiana's voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented\nout than not.\n\"Gilbert Blythe?\" said Anne. \"Isn't his name that's written up on the\nporch wall with Julia Bell's and a big 'Take Notice' over them?\"\n\"Yes,\" said Diana, tossing her head, \"but I'm sure he doesn't like Julia\nBell so very much. I've heard him say he studied the multiplication\ntable by her freckles.\"\n\"Oh, don't speak about freckles to me,\" implored Anne. \"It isn't\ndelicate when I've got so many. But I do think that writing take-notices\nup on the wall about the boys and girls is the silliest ever. I should\njust like to see anybody dare to write my name up with a boy's. Not, of\ncourse,\" she hastened to add, \"that anybody would.\"\nAnne sighed. She didn't want her name written up. But it was a little\nhumiliating to know that there was no danger of it.\n\"Nonsense,\" said Diana, whose black eyes and glossy tresses had played\nsuch havoc with the hearts of Avonlea schoolboys that her name figured\non the porch walls in half a dozen take-notices. \"It's only meant as\na joke. And don't you be too sure your name won't ever be written up.\nCharlie Sloane is _dead gone_ on you. He told his mother--his _mother_,\nmind you--that you were the smartest girl in school. That's better than\nbeing good looking.\"\n\"No, it isn't,\" said Anne, feminine to the core. \"I'd rather be pretty\nthan clever. And I hate Charlie Sloane, I can't bear a boy with goggle\neyes. If anyone wrote my name up with his I'd never _get_ over it, Diana\nBarry. But it _is_ nice to keep head of your class.\"\n\"You'll have Gilbert in your class after this,\" said Diana, \"and he's\nused to being head of his class, I can tell you. He's only in the fourth\nbook although he's nearly fourteen. Four years ago his father was sick\nand had to go out to Alberta for his health and Gilbert went with him.\nThey were there three years and Gil didn't go to school hardly any\nuntil they came back. You won't find it so easy to keep head after this,\nAnne.\"\n\"I'm glad,\" said Anne quickly. \"I couldn't really feel proud of keeping\nhead of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. I got up yesterday\nspelling 'ebullition.' Josie Pye was head and, mind you, she peeped\nin her book. Mr. Phillips didn't see her--he was looking at Prissy\nAndrews--but I did. I just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she\ngot as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.\"\n\"Those Pye girls are cheats all round,\" said Diana indignantly, as they\nclimbed the fence of the main road. \"Gertie Pye actually went and put\nher milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. Did you ever? I\ndon't speak to her now.\"\nWhen Mr. Phillips was in the back of the room hearing Prissy Andrews's\nLatin, Diana whispered to Anne, \"That's Gilbert Blythe sitting right\nacross the aisle from you, Anne. Just look at him and see if you don't\nthink he's handsome.\"\nAnne looked accordingly. She had a good chance to do so, for the said\nGilbert Blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid\nof Ruby Gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. He\nwas a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth\ntwisted into a teasing smile. Presently Ruby Gillis started up to take\na sum to the master; she fell back into her seat with a little shriek,\nbelieving that her hair was pulled out by the roots. Everybody looked at\nher and Mr. Phillips glared so sternly that Ruby began to cry. Gilbert\nhad whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the\nsoberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at\nAnne and winked with inexpressible drollery.\n\"I think your Gilbert Blythe _is_ handsome,\" confided Anne to Diana,\n\"but I think he's very bold. It isn't good manners to wink at a strange\ngirl.\"\nBut it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.\nMr. Phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to\nPrissy Andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as\nthey pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their\nslates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.\nGilbert Blythe was trying to make Anne Shirley look at him and failing\nutterly, because Anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only\nto the very existence of Gilbert Blythe, but of every other scholar in\nAvonlea school itself. With her chin propped on her hands and her eyes\nfixed on the blue glimpse of the Lake of Shining Waters that the west\nwindow afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and\nseeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.\nGilbert Blythe wasn't used to putting himself out to make a girl look\nat him and meeting with failure. She _should_ look at him, that red-haired\nShirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that weren't\nlike the eyes of any other girl in Avonlea school.\nGilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of Anne's long red\nbraid, held it out at arm's length and said in a piercing whisper:\n\"Carrots! Carrots!\"\nThen Anne looked at him with a vengeance!\nShe did more than look. She sprang to her feet, her bright fancies\nfallen into cureless ruin. She flashed one indignant glance at Gilbert\nfrom eyes whose angry sparkle was swiftly quenched in equally angry\ntears.\n\"You mean, hateful boy!\" she exclaimed passionately. \"How dare you!\"\nAnd then--thwack! Anne had brought her slate down on Gilbert's head and\ncracked it--slate not head--clear across.\nAvonlea school always enjoyed a scene. This was an especially enjoyable\none. Everybody said \"Oh\" in horrified delight. Diana gasped. Ruby\nGillis, who was inclined to be hysterical, began to cry. Tommy\nSloane let his team of crickets escape him altogether while he stared\nopen-mouthed at the tableau.\nMr. Phillips stalked down the aisle and laid his hand heavily on Anne's\nshoulder.\n\"Anne Shirley, what does this mean?\" he said angrily. Anne returned no\nanswer. It was asking too much of flesh and blood to expect her to tell\nbefore the whole school that she had been called \"carrots.\" Gilbert it\nwas who spoke up stoutly.\n\"It was my fault Mr. Phillips. I teased her.\"\nMr. Phillips paid no heed to Gilbert.\n\"I am sorry to see a pupil of mine displaying such a temper and such\na vindictive spirit,\" he said in a solemn tone, as if the mere fact of\nbeing a pupil of his ought to root out all evil passions from the hearts\nof small imperfect mortals. \"Anne, go and stand on the platform in front\nof the blackboard for the rest of the afternoon.\"\nAnne would have infinitely preferred a whipping to this punishment under\nwhich her sensitive spirit quivered as from a whiplash. With a white,\nset face she obeyed. Mr. Phillips took a chalk crayon and wrote on the\nblackboard above her head.\n\"Ann Shirley has a very bad temper. Ann Shirley must learn to control\nher temper,\" and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,\nwho couldn't read writing, should understand it.\nAnne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.\nShe did not cry or hang her head. Anger was still too hot in her heart\nfor that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. With\nresentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike Diana's\nsympathetic gaze and Charlie Sloane's indignant nods and Josie Pye's\nmalicious smiles. As for Gilbert Blythe, she would not even look at him.\nShe would _never_ look at him again! She would never speak to him!!\nWhen school was dismissed Anne marched out with her red head held high.\nGilbert Blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.\n\"I'm awfully sorry I made fun of your hair, Anne,\" he whispered\ncontritely. \"Honest I am. Don't be mad for keeps, now.\"\nAnne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. \"Oh\nhow could you, Anne?\" breathed Diana as they went down the road half\nreproachfully, half admiringly. Diana felt that _she_ could never have\nresisted Gilbert's plea.\n\"I shall never forgive Gilbert Blythe,\" said Anne firmly. \"And Mr.\nPhillips spelled my name without an e, too. The iron has entered into my\nsoul, Diana.\"\nDiana hadn't the least idea what Anne meant but she understood it was\nsomething terrible.\n\"You mustn't mind Gilbert making fun of your hair,\" she said soothingly.\n\"Why, he makes fun of all the girls.

He's called me a crow a dozen times; and I never heard him\napologize for anything before, either.\"\n\"There's a great deal of difference between being called a crow and\nbeing called carrots,\" said Anne with dignity. \"Gilbert Blythe has hurt\nmy feelings _excruciatingly_, Diana.\"",

But when things begin to\nhappen they are apt to keep on.\nAvonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in Mr. Bell's spruce\ngrove over the hill and across his big pasture field. From there they\ncould keep an eye on Eben Wright's house, where the master boarded. When\nthey saw Mr. Phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhouse;\nbut the distance being about three times longer than Mr. Wright's lane\nthey were very apt to arrive there, breathless and gasping, some three\nminutes too late.\nOn the following day Mr. Phillips was seized with one of his spasmodic\nfits of reform and announced before going home to dinner, that he should\nexpect to find all the scholars in their seats when he returned. Anyone\nwho came in late would be punished.\nAll the boys and some of the girls went to Mr. Bell's spruce grove as\nusual, fully intending to stay only long enough to \"pick a chew.\" But\nspruce groves are seductive and yellow nuts of gum beguiling; they\npicked and loitered and strayed; and as usual the first thing that\nrecalled them to a sense of the flight of time was Jimmy Glover shouting\nfrom the top of a patriarchal old spruce \"Master's coming.\"\nThe girls who were on the ground, started first and managed to reach the\nschoolhouse in time but without a second to spare. The boys, who had to\nwriggle hastily down from the trees, were later; and Anne, who had not\nbeen picking gum at all but was wandering happily in the far end of the\ngrove, waist deep among the bracken, singing softly to herself, with a\nwreath of rice lilies on her hair as if she were some wild divinity\nof the shadowy places, was latest of all. Anne could run like a deer,\nhowever; run she did with the impish result that she overtook the boys\nat the door and was swept into the schoolhouse among them just as Mr.\nPhillips was in the act of hanging up his hat.\nMr. Phillips's brief reforming energy was over; he didn't want the\nbother of punishing a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something\nto save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it\nin Anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a\nforgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a\nparticularly rakish and disheveled appearance.\n\"Anne Shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boys' company we\nshall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,\" he said sarcastically.\n\"Take those flowers out of your hair and sit with Gilbert Blythe.\"\nThe other boys snickered. Diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the\nwreath from Anne's hair and squeezed her hand. Anne stared at the master\nas if turned to stone.\n\"Did you hear what I said, Anne?\" queried Mr. Phillips sternly.\n\"Yes, sir,\" said Anne slowly \"but I didn't suppose you really meant it.\"\n\"I assure you I did\"--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the\nchildren, and Anne especially, hated. It flicked on the raw. \"Obey me at\nonce.\"\nFor a moment Anne looked as if she meant to disobey. Then, realizing\nthat there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the\naisle, sat down beside Gilbert Blythe, and buried her face in her arms",

Ruby Gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down,\ntold the others going home from school that she'd \"acksually never seen\nanything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.\"\nTo Anne, this was as the end of all things. It was bad enough to be\nsingled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it\nwas worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should\nbe Gilbert Blythe was heaping insult on injury to a degree utterly\nunbearable. Anne felt that she could not bear it and it would be of\nno use to try. Her whole being seethed with shame and anger and\nhumiliation.\nAt first the other scholars looked and whispered and giggled and nudged.\nBut as Anne never lifted her head and as Gilbert worked fractions as if\nhis whole soul was absorbed in them and them only, they soon returned\nto their own tasks and Anne was forgotten. When Mr. Phillips called the\nhistory class out Anne should have gone, but Anne did not move, and\nMr. Phillips, who had been writing some verses \"To Priscilla\" before he\ncalled the class, was thinking about an obstinate rhyme still and never\nmissed her. Once, when nobody was looking, Gilbert took from his desk\na little pink candy heart with a gold motto on it, \"You are sweet,\" and\nslipped it under the curve of Anne's arm. Whereupon Anne arose, took the\npink heart gingerly between the tips of her fingers, dropped it on the\nfloor, ground it to powder beneath her heel, and resumed her position\nwithout deigning to bestow a glance on Gilbert.\nWhen school went out Anne marched to her desk, ostentatiously took out\neverything therein, books and writing tablet, pen and ink, testament and\narithmetic, and piled them neatly on her cracked slate.\n\"What are you taking all those things home for, Anne?\" Diana wanted to\nknow, as soon as they were out on the road. She had not dared to ask the\nquestion before.\n\"I am not coming back to school any more,\" said Anne. Diana gasped and\nstared at Anne to see if she meant it.\n\"Will Marilla let you stay home?\" she asked.\n\"She'll have to,\" said Anne. \"I'll _never_ go to school to that man\nagain.\"\n\"Oh, Anne!\" Diana looked as if she were ready to cry. \"I do think you're\nmean. What shall I do? Mr. Phillips will make me sit with that horrid\nGertie Pye--I know he will because she is sitting alone. Do come back,\nAnne.\"\n\"I'd do almost anything in the world for you, Diana,\" said Anne sadly.\n\"I'd let myself be torn limb from limb if it would do you any good. But\nI can't do this, so please don't ask it. You harrow up my very soul.\"\n\"Just think of all the fun you will miss,\" mourned Diana. \"We are going\nto build the loveliest new house down by the brook; and we'll be playing\nball next week and you've never played ball, Anne. It's tremendously\nexciting. And we're going to learn a new song--Jane Andrews is\npracticing it up now; and Alice Andrews is going to bring a new Pansy\nbook next week and we're all going to read it out loud, chapter about,\ndown by the brook. And you know you are so fond of reading out loud,\nAnne.\"\nNothing moved Anne in the least. Her mind was made up. She would not go\nto school to Mr. Phillips again; she told Marilla so when she got home.\n\"Nonsense,\" said Marilla.\n\"It isn't nonsense at all,\" said Anne, gazing at Marilla with solemn,\nreproachful eyes. \"Don't you understand, Marilla? I've been insulted.\"\n\"Insulted fiddlesticks! You'll go to school tomorrow as usual.\"\n\"Oh, no.\" Anne shook her head gently. \"I'm not going back, Marilla. I'll\nlearn my lessons at home and I'll be as good as I can be and hold my\ntongue all the time if it's possible at all. But I will not go back to\nschool, I assure you.\"\nMarilla saw something remarkably like unyielding stubbornness looking\nout of Anne's small face. She understood that she would have trouble in\novercoming it; but she re-solved wisely to say nothing more just then.\n\"I'll run down and see Rachel about it this evening,\" she thought.",

It's my belief that\nMr. Phillips was in the wrong. Of course, it doesn't do to say so to the\nchildren, you know. And of course he did right to punish her yesterday\nfor giving way to temper. But today it was different. The others who\nwere late should have been punished as well as Anne, that's what. And I\ndon't believe in making the girls sit with the boys for punishment. It\nisn't modest. Tillie Boulter was real indignant. She took Anne's part\nright through and said all the scholars did too. Anne seems real popular\namong them, somehow. I never thought she'd take with them so well.\"\n\"Then you really think I'd better let her stay home,\" said Marilla in\namazement.\n\"Yes. That is I wouldn't say school to her again until she said it\nherself. Depend upon it, Marilla, she'll cool off in a week or so and\nbe ready enough to go back of her own accord, that's what, while, if\nyou were to make her go back right off, dear knows what freak or tantrum\nshe'd take next and make more trouble than ever. The less fuss made the\nbetter, in my opinion. She won't miss much by not going to school, as\nfar as _that_ goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The\norder he keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he neglects the young\nfry and puts all his time on those big scholars he's getting ready for\nQueen's. He'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle\nhadn't been a trustee--_the_ trustee, for he just leads the other two\naround by the nose, that's what. I declare, I don't know what education\nin this Island is coming to.\"\nMrs. Rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the\nhead of the educational system of the Province things would be much\nbetter managed.\nMarilla took Mrs. Rachel's advice and not another word was said to Anne",

She learned her lessons at home, did her\nchores, and played with Diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights;\nbut when she met Gilbert Blythe on the road or encountered him in Sunday\nschool she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by\nhis evident desire to appease her. Even Diana's efforts as a peacemaker\nwere of no avail. Anne had evidently made up her mind to hate Gilbert\nBlythe to the end of life.\nAs much as she hated Gilbert, however, did she love Diana, with all the\nlove of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and\ndislikes. One evening Marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket\nof apples, found Anne sitting along by the east window in the twilight,\ncrying bitterly.\n\"Whatever's the matter now, Anne?\" she asked.\n\"It's about Diana,\" sobbed Anne luxuriously. \"I love Diana so, Marilla.\nI cannot ever live without her. But I know very well when we grow up\nthat Diana will get married and go away and leave me. And oh, what shall\nI do? I hate her husband--I just hate him furiously. I've been imagining\nit all out--the wedding and everything--Diana dressed in snowy garments,\nwith a veil, and looking as beautiful and regal as a queen; and me the\nbridesmaid, with a lovely dress too, and puffed sleeves, but with a\nbreaking heart hid beneath my smiling face. And then bidding Diana\ngoodbye-e-e--\" Here Anne broke down entirely and wept with increasing\nbitterness.\nMarilla turned quickly away to hide her twitching face; but it was no\nuse; she collapsed on the nearest chair and burst into such a hearty and\nunusual peal of laughter that Matthew, crossing the yard outside, halted\nin amazement. When had he heard Marilla laugh like that before?",

It would be terrible if we just skipped from\nSeptember to November, wouldn't it? Look at these maple branches. Don't\nthey give you a thrill--several thrills? I'm going to decorate my room\nwith them.\"\n\"Messy things,\" said Marilla, whose aesthetic sense was not noticeably\ndeveloped. \"You clutter up your room entirely too much with out-of-doors\nstuff, Anne. Bedrooms were made to sleep in.\"\n\"Oh, and dream in too, Marilla. And you know one can dream so much\nbetter in a room where there are pretty things. I'm going to put these\nboughs in the old blue jug and set them on my table.\"\n\"Mind you don't drop leaves all over the stairs then. I'm going on a\nmeeting of the Aid Society at Carmody this afternoon, Anne, and I won't\nlikely be home before dark. You'll have to get Matthew and Jerry their\nsupper, so mind you don't forget to put the tea to draw until you sit\ndown at the table as you did last time.\"\n\"It was dreadful of me to forget,\" said Anne apologetically, \"but that\nwas the afternoon I was trying to think of a name for Violet Vale and it\ncrowded other things out. Matthew was so good. He never scolded a bit.\nHe put the tea down himself and said we could wait awhile as well as\nnot. And I told him a lovely fairy story while we were waiting, so\nhe didn't find the time long at all. It was a beautiful fairy story,\nMarilla. I forgot the end of it, so I made up an end for it myself and\nMatthew said he couldn't tell where the join came in.\"\n\"Matthew would think it all right, Anne, if you took a notion to get up\nand have dinner in the middle of the night. But you keep your wits about\nyou this time. And--I don't really know if I'm doing right--it may make\nyou more addlepated than ever--but you can ask Diana to come over and\nspend the afternoon with you and have tea here.\"\n\"Oh, Marilla!\" Anne clasped her hands. \"How perfectly lovely! You _are_\nable to imagine things after all or else you'd never have understood how\nI've longed for that very thing. It will seem so nice and grown-uppish.\nNo fear of my forgetting to put the tea to draw when I have company. Oh,\nMarilla, can I use the rosebud spray tea set?\"\n\"No, indeed! The rosebud tea set! Well, what next? You know I never use\nthat except for the minister or the Aids. You'll put down the old brown\ntea set. But you can open the little yellow crock of cherry preserves.\nIt's time it was being used anyhow--I believe it's beginning to work.\nAnd you can cut some fruit cake and have some of the cookies and snaps.\"\n\"I can just imagine myself sitting down at the head of the table and\npouring out the tea,\" said Anne, shutting her eyes ecstatically. \"And\nasking Diana if she takes sugar! I know she doesn't but of course I'll\nask her just as if I didn't know. And then pressing her to take another\npiece of fruit cake and another helping of preserves. Oh, Marilla, it's\na wonderful sensation just to think of it. Can I take her into the spare\nroom to lay off her hat when she comes? And then into the parlor to\nsit?\"\n\"No. The sitting room will do for you and your company. But there's a\nbottle half full of raspberry cordial that was left over from the church\nsocial the other night. It's on the second shelf of the sitting-room\ncloset and you and Diana can have it if you like, and a cooky to eat\nwith it along in the afternoon, for I daresay Matthew 'll be late coming\nin to tea since he's hauling potatoes to the vessel.\"",

            "text": "\"I should think Marilla's raspberry cordial would prob'ly be much nicer\nthan Mrs. Lynde's,\" said Anne loyally. \"Marilla is a famous cook. She is\ntrying to teach me to cook but I assure you, Diana, it is uphill work.\nThere's so little scope for imagination in cookery. You just have to go\nby rules. The last time I made a cake I forgot to put the flour in. I\nwas thinking the loveliest story about you and me, Diana. I thought you\nwere desperately ill with smallpox and everybody deserted you, but I\nwent boldly to your bedside and nursed you back to life; and then I took\nthe smallpox and died and I was buried under those poplar trees in the\ngraveyard and you planted a rosebush by my grave and watered it with\nyour tears; and you never, never forgot the friend of your youth who\nsacrificed her life for you. Oh, it was such a pathetic tale, Diana.\nThe tears just rained down over my cheeks while I mixed the cake. But\nI forgot the flour and the cake was a dismal failure. Flour is so\nessential to cakes, you know. Marilla was very cross and I don't wonder.\nI'm a great trial to her. She was terribly mortified about the pudding\nsauce last week. We had a plum pudding for dinner on Tuesday and there\nwas half the pudding and a pitcherful of sauce left over. Marilla said\nthere was enough for another dinner and told me to set it on the pantry\nshelf and cover it. I meant to cover it just as much as could be, Diana,\nbut when I carried it in I was imagining I was a nun--of course I'm a\nProtestant but I imagined I was a Catholic--taking the veil to bury a\nbroken heart in cloistered seclusion; and I forgot all about covering\nthe pudding sauce. I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry.\nDiana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in\nthat pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out\nin the yard and then I washed the spoon in three waters. Marilla was out\nmilking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I'd give the\nsauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was\na frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow,\nwhichever they wanted to be, so I never thought about the pudding sauce\nagain and Marilla sent me out to pick apples. Well, Mr. and Mrs. Chester\nRoss from Spencervale came here that morning. You know they are very\nstylish people, especially Mrs. Chester Ross. When Marilla called me in\ndinner was all ready and everybody was at the table. I tried to be as\npolite and dignified as I could be, for I wanted Mrs. Chester Ross to\nthink I was a ladylike little girl even if I wasn't pretty. Everything\nwent right until I saw Marilla coming with the plum pudding in one hand\nand the pitcher of pudding sauce _warmed up_, in the other. Diana, that\nwas a terrible moment. I remembered everything and I just stood up in\nmy place and shrieked out 'Marilla, you mustn't use that pudding sauce.\nThere was a mouse drowned in it. I forgot to tell you before.' Oh,\nDiana, I shall never forget that awful moment if I live to be a hundred.\nMrs. Chester Ross just _looked_ at me and I thought I would sink through\nthe floor with mortification. She is such a perfect housekeeper and\nfancy what she must have thought of us. Marilla turned red as fire but\nshe never said a word--then. She just carried that sauce and pudding out\nand brought in some strawberry preserves. She even offered me some, but\nI couldn't swallow a mouthful. It was like heaping coals of fire on\nmy head. After Mrs. Chester Ross went away, Marilla gave me a dreadful\nscolding. Why, Diana, what is the matter?\"\nDiana had stood up very unsteadily; then she sat down again, putting her\nhands to her head.\n\"I'm--I'm awful sick,\" she said, a little thickly. \"I--I--must go right\nhome.\"\n\"Oh, you mustn't dream of going home without your tea,\" cried Anne in\ndistress. \"I'll get it right off--I'll go and put the tea down this very\nminute.\"\n\"I must go home,\" repeated Diana, stupidly but determinedly.\n\"Let me get you a lunch anyhow,\" implored Anne. \"Let me give you a bit\nof fruit cake and some of the cherry preserves. Lie down on the sofa for\na little while and you'll be better. Where do you feel bad?\"\n\"I must go home,\" said Diana, and that was all she would say. In vain\nAnne pleaded.\n\"I never heard of company going home without tea,\" she mourned. \"Oh,\nDiana, do you suppose that it's possible you're really taking the\nsmallpox? If you are I'll go and nurse you, you can depend on that. I'll\nnever forsake you. But I do wish you'd stay till after tea. Where do you\nfeel bad?\"\n\"I'm awful dizzy,\" said Diana.\nAnd indeed, she walked very dizzily. Anne, with tears of disappointment\nin her eyes, got Diana's hat and went with her as far as the Barry\nyard fence. Then she wept all the way back to Green Gables, where she\nsorrowfully put the remainder of the raspberry cordial back into the\npantry and got tea ready for Matthew and Jerry, with all the zest gone",

Into the kitchen she dashed and flung herself face\ndownward on the sofa in an agony.\n\"Whatever has gone wrong now, Anne?\" queried Marilla in doubt and\ndismay. \"I do hope you haven't gone and been saucy to Mrs. Lynde again.\"\nNo answer from Anne save more tears and stormier sobs!\n\"Anne Shirley, when I ask you a question I want to be answered. Sit\nright up this very minute and tell me what you are crying about.\"\nAnne sat up, tragedy personified.\n\"Mrs. Lynde was up to see Mrs. Barry today and Mrs. Barry was in an\nawful state,\" she wailed. \"She says that I set Diana _drunk_ Saturday\nand sent her home in a disgraceful condition. And she says I must be a\nthoroughly bad, wicked little girl and she's never, never going to let\nDiana play with me again. Oh, Marilla, I'm just overcome with woe.\"\nMarilla stared in blank amazement.\n\"Set Diana drunk!\" she said when she found her voice. \"Anne are you or\nMrs. Barry crazy? What on earth did you give her?\"\n\"Not a thing but raspberry cordial,\" sobbed Anne. \"I never thought\nraspberry cordial would set people drunk, Marilla--not even if they\ndrank three big tumblerfuls as Diana did. Oh, it sounds so--so--like\nMrs. Thomas's husband! But I didn't mean to set her drunk.\"\n\"Drunk fiddlesticks!\" said Marilla, marching to the sitting room pantry.\nThere on the shelf was a bottle which she at once recognized as one\ncontaining some of her three-year-old homemade currant wine for which\nshe was celebrated in Avonlea, although certain of the stricter sort,\nMrs. Barry among them, disapproved strongly of it. And at the same time\nMarilla recollected that she had put the bottle of raspberry cordial\ndown in the cellar instead of in the pantry as she had told Anne.\nShe went back to the kitchen with the wine bottle in her hand. Her face\nwas twitching in spite of herself.\n\"Anne, you certainly have a genius for getting into trouble. You went\nand gave Diana currant wine instead of raspberry cordial. Didn't you\nknow the difference yourself?\"\n\"I never tasted it,\" said Anne. \"I thought it was the cordial. I meant\nto be so--so--hospitable. Diana got awfully sick and had to go home.\nMrs. Barry told Mrs. Lynde she was simply dead drunk. She just laughed\nsilly-like when her mother asked her what was the matter and went to\nsleep and slept for hours. Her mother smelled her breath and knew she\nwas drunk. She had a fearful headache all day yesterday. Mrs. Barry is\nso indignant. She will never believe but what I did it on purpose.\"\n\"I should think she would better punish Diana for being so greedy as to\ndrink three glassfuls of anything,\" said Marilla shortly. \"Why, three\nof those big glasses would have made her sick even if it had only been\ncordial. Well, this story will be a nice handle for those folks who are\nso down on me for making currant wine, although I haven't made any for\nthree years ever since I found out that the minister didn't approve. I\njust kept that bottle for sickness. There, there, child, don't cry. I\ncan't see as you were to blame although I'm sorry it happened so.\"\n\"I must cry,\" said Anne. \"My heart is broken. The stars in their courses\nfight against me, Marilla. Diana and I are parted forever. Oh, Marilla,\nI little dreamed of this when first we swore our vows of friendship.\"\n\"Don't be foolish, Anne. Mrs. Barry will think better of it when she\nfinds you're not to blame. I suppose she thinks you've done it for a\nsilly joke or something of that sort. You'd best go up this evening and",

You're so much more dignified\nthan I am. Likely she'd listen to you quicker than to me.\"\n\"Well, I will,\" said Marilla, reflecting that it would probably be the\nwiser course. \"Don't cry any more, Anne. It will be all right.\"\nMarilla had changed her mind about it being all right by the time she\ngot back from Orchard Slope. Anne was watching for her coming and flew\nto the porch door to meet her.\n\"Oh, Marilla, I know by your face that it's been no use,\" she said\nsorrowfully. \"Mrs. Barry won't forgive me?\"\n\"Mrs. Barry indeed!\" snapped Marilla. \"Of all the unreasonable women\nI ever saw she's the worst. I told her it was all a mistake and you\nweren't to blame, but she just simply didn't believe me. And she rubbed\nit well in about my currant wine and how I'd always said it couldn't\nhave the least effect on anybody. I just told her plainly that currant\nwine wasn't meant to be drunk three tumblerfuls at a time and that if a\nchild I had to do with was so greedy I'd sober her up with a right good\nspanking.\"\nMarilla whisked into the kitchen, grievously disturbed, leaving a very\nmuch distracted little soul in the porch behind her. Presently Anne\nstepped out bareheaded into the chill autumn dusk; very determinedly and\nsteadily she took her way down through the sere clover field over the\nlog bridge and up through the spruce grove, lighted by a pale little\nmoon hanging low over the western woods. Mrs. Barry, coming to the door\nin answer to a timid knock, found a white-lipped eager-eyed suppliant on\nthe doorstep.\nHer face hardened. Mrs. Barry was a woman of strong prejudices and\ndislikes, and her anger was of the cold, sullen sort which is always\nhardest to overcome. To do her justice, she really believed Anne had\nmade Diana drunk out of sheer malice prepense, and she was honestly\nanxious to preserve her little daughter from the contamination of\nfurther intimacy with such a child.\n\"What do you want?\" she said stiffly.\nAnne clasped her hands.\n\"Oh, Mrs. Barry, please forgive me. I did not mean to--to--intoxicate\nDiana. How could I? Just imagine if you were a poor little orphan girl\nthat kind people had adopted and you had just one bosom friend in all\nthe world. Do you think you would intoxicate her on purpose? I thought\nit was only raspberry cordial. I was firmly convinced it was raspberry\ncordial. Oh, please don't say that you won't let Diana play with me any\nmore. If you do you will cover my life with a dark cloud of woe.\"\nThis speech which would have softened good Mrs. Lynde's heart in a\ntwinkling, had no effect on Mrs. Barry except to irritate her still\nmore. She was suspicious of Anne's big words and dramatic gestures and\nimagined that the child was making fun of her. So she said, coldly and\ncruelly:\n\"I don't think you are a fit little girl for Diana to associate with.\nYou'd better go home and behave yourself.\"\nAnne's lips quivered.\n\"Won't you let me see Diana just once to say farewell?\" she implored.\n\"Diana has gone over to Carmody with her father,\" said Mrs. Barry, going\nin and shutting the door.",

But the hope faded when she saw Diana's dejected\ncountenance.\n\"Your mother hasn't relented?\" she gasped.\nDiana shook her head mournfully.\n\"No; and oh, Anne, she says I'm never to play with you again. I've cried\nand cried and I told her it wasn't your fault, but it wasn't any use. I\nhad ever such a time coaxing her to let me come down and say good-bye to\nyou. She said I was only to stay ten minutes and she's timing me by the\nclock.\"\n\"Ten minutes isn't very long to say an eternal farewell in,\" said Anne\ntearfully. \"Oh, Diana, will you promise faithfully never to forget\nme, the friend of your youth, no matter what dearer friends may caress\nthee?\"\n\"Indeed I will,\" sobbed Diana, \"and I'll never have another bosom\nfriend--I don't want to have.

Oh, just say it once again.\"\n\"I love you devotedly, Anne,\" said Diana stanchly, \"and I always will,\nyou may be sure of that.\"\n\"And I will always love thee, Diana,\" said Anne, solemnly extending her\nhand. \"In the years to come thy memory will shine like a star over my\nlonely life, as that last story we read together says.

I've got my patchwork scissors in my apron pocket fortunately,\"\nsaid Anne. She solemnly clipped one of Diana's curls. \"Fare thee well,\nmy beloved friend. Henceforth we must be as strangers though living side\nby side.

When Anne\nwent to her seat after dinner hour--she had been told by Mr. Phillips to\nsit with the model Minnie Andrews--she found on her desk a big luscious\n\"strawberry apple.\" Anne caught it up all ready to take a bite when she\nremembered that the only place in Avonlea where strawberry apples grew\nwas in the old Blythe orchard on the other side of the Lake of Shining\nWaters. Anne dropped the apple as if it were a red-hot coal and\nostentatiously wiped her fingers on her handkerchief. The apple lay\nuntouched on her desk until the next morning, when little Timothy\nAndrews, who swept the school and kindled the fire, annexed it as one\nof his perquisites. Charlie Sloane's slate pencil, gorgeously bedizened\nwith striped red and yellow paper, costing two cents where ordinary\npencils cost only one, which he sent up to her after dinner hour, met\nwith a more favorable reception. Anne was graciously pleased to accept\nit and rewarded the donor with a smile which exalted that infatuated\nyouth straightway into the seventh heaven of delight and caused him to\nmake such fearful errors in his dictation that Mr. Phillips kept him in\nafter school to rewrite it.\nBut as,\nThe C\u00e6sar's pageant shorn of Brutus' bust\nDid but of Rome's best son remind her more,\nso the marked absence of any tribute or recognition from Diana Barry who\nwas sitting with Gertie Pye embittered Anne's little triumph.\n\"Diana might just have smiled at me once, I think,\" she mourned to\nMarilla that night. But the next morning a note most fearfully and\nwonderfully twisted and folded, and a small parcel were passed across to\nAnne.\n\"Dear Anne, ran the former, \"Mother says I'm not to play with you or\ntalk to you even in school. It isn't my fault and don't be cross at\nme, because I love you as much as ever. I miss you awfully to tell\nall my secrets to and I don't like Gertie Pye one bit. I made you\none of the new bookmarkers out of red tissue paper. They are awfully\nfashionable now and only three girls in school know how to make\nthem. When you look at it remember\nYour true friend,\nDiana Barry.\nAnne read the note, kissed the bookmark, and dispatched a prompt reply\nback to the other side of the school.\nMy own darling Diana:--\nOf course I am not cross at you because you have to obey your mother.\nOur spirits can commune. I shall keep your lovely present forever.\nMinnie Andrews is a very nice little girl--although she has no\nimagination--but after having been Diana's busum friend I cannot be\nMinnie's. Please excuse mistakes because my spelling isn't very good\nyet, although much improoved.\nYours until death us do part\nAnne or Cordelia Shirley.\nP.S. I shall sleep with your letter under my pillow tonight. A. _or_ C.S.\nMarilla pessimistically expected more trouble since Anne had again begun\nto go to school. But none developed. Perhaps Anne caught something of\nthe \"model\" spirit from Minnie Andrews; at least she got on very well\nwith Mr. Phillips thenceforth. She flung herself into her studies heart\nand soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by Gilbert Blythe.\nThe rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured\non Gilbert's side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing\ncannot be said of Anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for\nholding grudges. She was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. She\nwould not stoop to admit that she meant to rival Gilbert in schoolwork,\nbecause that would have been to acknowledge his existence which Anne\npersistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated\nbetween them. Now Gilbert was head of the spelling class; now Anne, with\na toss of her long red braids, spelled him down. One morning Gilbert had\nall his sums done correctly and had his name written on the blackboard\non the roll of honor; the next morning Anne, having wrestled wildly with\ndecimals the entire evening before, would be first. One awful day they\nwere ties and their names were written up together. It was almost as bad\nas a take-notice and Anne's mortification was as evident as Gilbert's\nsatisfaction. When the written examinations at the end of each month\nwere held the suspense was terrible. The first month Gilbert came out\nthree marks ahead. The second Anne beat him by five. But her triumph was\nmarred by the fact that Gilbert congratulated her heartily before the\nwhole school. It would have been ever so much sweeter to her if he had\nfelt the sting of his defeat.\nMr. Phillips might not be a very good teacher; but a pupil so inflexibly\ndetermined on learning as Anne was could hardly escape making progress\nunder any kind of teacher. By the end of the term Anne and Gilbert were\nboth promoted into the fifth class and allowed to begin studying the\nelements of \"the branches\"--by which Latin, geometry, French, and\nalgebra were meant. In geometry Anne met her Waterloo.\n\"It's perfectly awful stuff, Marilla,\" she groaned. \"I'm sure I'll never\nbe able to make head or tail of it. There is no scope for imagination in\nit at all. Mr. Phillips says I'm the worst dunce he ever saw at it.\nAnd Gil--I mean some of the others are so smart at it. It is extremely\nmortifying, Marilla.\n\"Even Diana gets along better than I do. But I don't mind being beaten\nby Diana. Even although we meet as strangers now I still love her with\nan _inextinguishable_ love. It makes me very sad at times to think about\nher. But really, Marilla, one can't stay sad very long in such an\ninteresting world, can one?\"",

            "text": "Hence, while Marilla and Mrs. Rachel were enjoying themselves hugely\nat the mass meeting, Anne and Matthew had the cheerful kitchen at Green\nGables all to themselves. A bright fire was glowing in the old-fashioned\nWaterloo stove and blue-white frost crystals were shining on the\nwindowpanes. Matthew nodded over a _Farmers' Advocate_ on the sofa and\nAnne at the table studied her lessons with grim determination, despite\nsundry wistful glances at the clock shelf, where lay a new book that\nJane Andrews had lent her that day. Jane had assured her that it was\nwarranted to produce any number of thrills, or words to that effect, and\nAnne's fingers tingled to reach out for it. But that would mean Gilbert\nBlythe's triumph on the morrow. Anne turned her back on the clock shelf\nand tried to imagine it wasn't there.\n\"Matthew, did you ever study geometry when you went to school?\"\n\"Well now, no, I didn't,\" said Matthew, coming out of his doze with a\nstart.\n\"I wish you had,\" sighed Anne, \"because then you'd be able to sympathize\nwith me. You can't sympathize properly if you've never studied it. It is\ncasting a cloud over my whole life. I'm such a dunce at it, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew soothingly. \"I guess you're all right\nat anything. Mr. Phillips told me last week in Blair's store at Carmody\nthat you was the smartest scholar in school and was making rapid\nprogress. 'Rapid progress' was his very words. There's them as runs down\nTeddy Phillips and says he ain't much of a teacher, but I guess he's all\nright.\"\nMatthew would have thought anyone who praised Anne was \"all right.\"\n\"I'm sure I'd get on better with geometry if only he wouldn't change\nthe letters,\" complained Anne. \"I learn the proposition off by heart and\nthen he draws it on the blackboard and puts different letters from what\nare in the book and I get all mixed up. I don't think a teacher should\ntake such a mean advantage, do you? We're studying agriculture now and\nI've found out at last what makes the roads red. It's a great comfort.\nI wonder how Marilla and Mrs. Lynde are enjoying themselves. Mrs. Lynde\nsays Canada is going to the dogs the way things are being run at Ottawa\nand that it's an awful warning to the electors. She says if women were\nallowed to vote we would soon see a blessed change. What way do you\nvote, Matthew?\"\n\"Conservative,\" said Matthew promptly. To vote Conservative was part of\nMatthew's religion.\n\"Then I'm Conservative too,\" said Anne decidedly. \"I'm glad because\nGil--because some of the boys in school are Grits. I guess Mr. Phillips\nis a Grit too because Prissy Andrews's father is one, and Ruby Gillis\nsays that when a man is courting he always has to agree with the girl's\nmother in religion and her father in politics. Is that true, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno,\" said Matthew.\n\"Did you ever go courting, Matthew?\"\n\"Well now, no, I dunno's I ever did,\" said Matthew, who had certainly\nnever thought of such a thing in his whole existence.\nAnne reflected with her chin in her hands.\n\"It must be rather interesting, don't you think, Matthew? Ruby Gillis\nsays when she grows up she's going to have ever so many beaus on the\nstring and have them all crazy about her; but I think that would be too\nexciting. I'd rather have just one in his right mind. But Ruby Gillis\nknows a great deal about such matters because she has so many big\nsisters, and Mrs. Lynde says the Gillis girls have gone off like hot\ncakes. Mr. Phillips goes up to see Prissy Andrews nearly every evening.\nHe says it is to help her with her lessons but Miranda Sloane is\nstudying for Queen's too, and I should think she needed help a lot more\nthan Prissy because she's ever so much stupider, but he never goes to\nhelp her in the evenings at all. There are a great many things in this\nworld that I can't understand very well, Matthew.\"\n\"Well now, I dunno as I comprehend them all myself,\" acknowledged\nMatthew.\n\"Well, I suppose I must finish up my lessons. I won't allow myself to\nopen that new book Jane lent me until I'm through. But it's a terrible\ntemptation, Matthew. Even when I turn my back on it I can see it there\njust as plain. Jane said she cried herself sick over it. I love a book\nthat makes me cry. But I think I'll carry that book into the sitting\nroom and lock it in the jam closet and give you the key. And you must\n_not_ give it to me, Matthew, until my lessons are done, not even if\nI implore you on my bended knees. It's all very well to say resist\ntemptation, but it's ever so much easier to resist it if you can't get\nthe key. And then shall I run down the cellar and get some russets,\nMatthew? Wouldn't you like some russets?\"\n\"Well now, I dunno but what I would,\" said Matthew, who never ate\nrussets but knew Anne's weakness for them.\nJust as Anne emerged triumphantly from the cellar with her plateful of\nrussets came the sound of flying footsteps on the icy board walk outside\nand the next moment the kitchen door was flung open and in rushed Diana\nBarry, white faced and breathless, with a shawl wrapped hastily around\nher head. Anne promptly let go of her candle and plate in her surprise,\nand plate, candle, and apples crashed together down the cellar ladder\nand were found at the bottom embedded in melted grease, the next day,",

But he can speak. I was proud of\nbeing a Conservative. Rachel Lynde, of course, being a Liberal, had no\nuse for him. Your dinner is in the oven, Anne, and you can get yourself\nsome blue plum preserve out of the pantry. I guess you're hungry.\nMatthew has been telling me about last night. I must say it was\nfortunate you knew what to do. I wouldn't have had any idea myself, for\nI never saw a case of croup. There now, never mind talking till you've\nhad your dinner. I can tell by the look of you that you're just full up\nwith speeches, but they'll keep.\"\nMarilla had something to tell Anne, but she did not tell it just then\nfor she knew if she did Anne's consequent excitement would lift her\nclear out of the region of such material matters as appetite or dinner.\nNot until Anne had finished her saucer of blue plums did Marilla say:\n\"Mrs. Barry was here this afternoon, Anne. She wanted to see you, but I\nwouldn't wake you up. She says you saved Minnie May's life, and she is\nvery sorry she acted as she did in that affair of the currant wine. She\nsays she knows now you didn't mean to set Diana drunk, and she hopes\nyou'll forgive her and be good friends with Diana again. You're to go\nover this evening if you like for Diana can't stir outside the door\non account of a bad cold she caught last night. Now, Anne Shirley, for\npity's sake don't fly up into the air.\"\nThe warning seemed not unnecessary, so uplifted and aerial was Anne's\nexpression and attitude as she sprang to her feet, her face irradiated\nwith the flame of her spirit.\n\"Oh, Marilla, can I go right now--without washing my dishes? I'll wash\nthem when I come back, but I cannot tie myself down to anything so\nunromantic as dishwashing at this thrilling moment.\"\n\"Yes, yes, run along,\" said Marilla indulgently. \"Anne Shirley--are you\ncrazy? Come back this instant and put something on you. I might as well\ncall to the wind. She's gone without a cap or wrap. Look at her tearing\nthrough the orchard with her hair streaming. It'll be a mercy if she\ndoesn't catch her death of cold.\"\nAnne came dancing home in the purple winter twilight across the snowy\nplaces. Afar in the southwest was the great shimmering, pearl-like\nsparkle of an evening star in a sky that was pale golden and ethereal\nrose over gleaming white spaces and dark glens of spruce. The tinkles\nof sleigh bells among the snowy hills came like elfin chimes through\nthe frosty air, but their music was not sweeter than the song in Anne's\nheart and on her lips.\n\"You see before you a perfectly happy person, Marilla,\" she announced.\n\"I'm perfectly happy--yes, in spite of my red hair. Just at present I\nhave a soul above red hair. Mrs. Barry kissed me and cried and said she\nwas so sorry and she could never repay me. I felt fearfully embarrassed,\nMarilla, but I just said as politely as I could, 'I have no hard\nfeelings for you, Mrs. Barry. I assure you once for all that I did not\nmean to intoxicate Diana and henceforth I shall cover the past with the\nmantle of oblivion.' That was a pretty dignified way of speaking wasn't\nit, Marilla?\"\n\"I felt that I was heaping coals of fire on Mrs. Barry's head. And Diana\nand I had a lovely afternoon. Diana showed me a new fancy crochet stitch\nher aunt over at Carmody taught her. Not a soul in Avonlea knows it but\nus, and we pledged a solemn vow never to reveal it to anyone else. Diana\ngave me a beautiful card with a wreath of roses on it and a verse of\npoetry:\"\n\"If you love me as I love you\nNothing but death can part us two.\"\n\"And that is true, Marilla. We're going to ask Mr. Phillips to let us\nsit together in school again, and Gertie Pye can go with Minnie Andrews.\nWe had an elegant tea. Mrs. Barry had the very best china set out,\nMarilla, just as if I was real company. I can't tell you what a thrill\nit gave me. Nobody ever used their very best china on my account before.\nAnd we had fruit cake and pound cake and doughnuts and two kinds of\npreserves, Marilla. And Mrs. Barry asked me if I took tea and said 'Pa,\nwhy don't you pass the biscuits to Anne?' It must be lovely to be grown\nup, Marilla, when just being treated as if you were is so nice.\"\n\"I don't know about that,\" said Marilla, with a brief sigh.\n\"Well, anyway, when I am grown up,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I'm always\ngoing to talk to little girls as if they were too, and I'll never laugh\nwhen they use big words. I know from sorrowful experience how that hurts\none's feelings. After tea Diana and I made taffy. The taffy wasn't very\ngood, I suppose because neither Diana nor I had ever made any before.\nDiana left me to stir it while she buttered the plates and I forgot and\nlet it burn; and then when we set it out on the platform to cool the cat\nwalked over one plate and that had to be thrown away. But the making of\nit was splendid fun. Then when I came home Mrs. Barry asked me to come\nover as often as I could and Diana stood at the window and threw kisses\nto me all the way down to Lover's Lane. I assure you, Marilla, that I\nfeel like praying tonight and I'm going to think out a special brand-new\nprayer in honor of the occasion.\"",

I\nhope you didn't disturb your aunt, Diana.\"\nDiana preserved a discreet silence, but she and Anne exchanged furtive\nsmiles of guilty amusement across the table. Anne hurried home after\nbreakfast and so remained in blissful ignorance of the disturbance which\npresently resulted in the Barry household until the late afternoon, when\nshe went down to Mrs. Lynde's on an errand for Marilla.\n\"So you and Diana nearly frightened poor old Miss Barry to death last\nnight?\" said Mrs. Lynde severely, but with a twinkle in her eye. \"Mrs.\nBarry was here a few minutes ago on her way to Carmody. She's feeling\nreal worried over it. Old Miss Barry was in a terrible temper when she\ngot up this morning--and Josephine Barry's temper is no joke, I can tell\nyou that. She wouldn't speak to Diana at all.\"\n\"It wasn't Diana's fault,\" said Anne contritely. \"It was mine. I\nsuggested racing to see who would get into bed first.\"\n\"I knew it!\" said Mrs. Lynde, with the exultation of a correct guesser.\n\"I knew that idea came out of your head. Well, it's made a nice lot of\ntrouble, that's what. Old Miss Barry came out to stay for a month, but\nshe declares she won't stay another day and is going right back to town\ntomorrow, Sunday and all as it is. She'd have gone today if they could\nhave taken her. She had promised to pay for a quarter's music lessons\nfor Diana, but now she is determined to do nothing at all for such a\ntomboy. Oh, I guess they had a lively time of it there this morning. The\nBarrys must feel cut up. Old Miss Barry is rich and they'd like to keep\non the good side of her. Of course, Mrs. Barry didn't say just that to\nme, but I'm a pretty good judge of human nature, that's what.\"\n\"I'm such an unlucky girl,\" mourned Anne. \"I'm always getting into\nscrapes myself and getting my best friends--people I'd shed my heart's\nblood for--into them too.

She saw nothing to laugh at in the situation, which to her\neyes appeared very serious. When she left Mrs. Lynde's she took her way\nacross the crusted fields to Orchard Slope. Diana met her at the kitchen\ndoor.\n\"Your Aunt Josephine was very cross about it, wasn't she?\" whispered\nAnne.\n\"Yes,\" answered Diana, stifling a giggle with an apprehensive glance\nover her shoulder at the closed sitting-room door. \"She was fairly\ndancing with rage, Anne. Oh, how she scolded. She said I was the\nworst-behaved girl she ever saw and that my parents ought to be ashamed\nof the way they had brought me up. She says she won't stay and I'm sure\nI don't care. But Father and Mother do.\"\n\"Why didn't you tell them it was my fault?\" demanded Anne.\n\"It's likely I'd do such a thing, isn't it?\" said Diana with just scorn.\n\"I'm no telltale, Anne Shirley, and anyhow I was just as much to blame\nas you.\"\n\"Well, I'm going in to tell her myself,\" said Anne resolutely.\nDiana stared.\n\"Anne Shirley, you'd never! why--she'll eat you alive!\"\n\"Don't frighten me any more than I am frightened,\" implored Anne. \"I'd\nrather walk up to a cannon's mouth. But I've got to do it, Diana. It\nwas my fault and I've got to confess. I've had practice in confessing,\nfortunately.\"\n\"Well, she's in the room,\" said Diana. \"You can go in if you want to. I\nwouldn't dare. And I don't believe you'll do a bit of good.\"\nWith this encouragement Anne bearded the lion in its den--that is to\nsay, walked resolutely up to the sitting-room door and knocked faintly.\nA sharp \"Come in\" followed.\nMiss Josephine Barry, thin, prim, and rigid, was knitting fiercely by\nthe fire, her wrath quite unappeased and her eyes snapping through her\ngold-rimmed glasses. She wheeled around in her chair, expecting to see\nDiana, and beheld a white-faced girl whose great eyes were brimmed up\nwith a mixture of desperate courage and shrinking terror.\n\"Who are you?\" demanded Miss Josephine Barry, without ceremony.\n\"I'm Anne of Green Gables,\" said the small visitor tremulously, clasping\nher hands with her characteristic gesture, \"and I've come to confess, if\nyou please.\"\n\"Confess what?\"\n\"That it was all my fault about jumping into bed on you last night. I\nsuggested it. Diana would never have thought of such a thing, I am sure.\nDiana is a very ladylike girl, Miss Barry. So you must see how unjust it\nis to blame her.\"\n\"Oh, I must, hey? I rather think Diana did her share of the jumping at\nleast. Such carryings on in a respectable house!\"\n\"But we were only in fun,\" persisted Anne. \"I think you ought to forgive\nus, Miss Barry, now that we've apologized. And anyhow, please forgive\nDiana and let her have her music lessons. Diana's heart is set on her\nmusic lessons, Miss Barry, and I know too well what it is to set your\nheart on a thing and not get it. If you must be cross with anyone, be\ncross with me. I've been so used in my early days to having people cross\nat me that I can endure it much better than Diana can.\"\nMuch of the snap had gone out of the old lady's eyes by this time\nand was replaced by a twinkle of amused interest. But she still said\nseverely:\n\"I don't think it is any excuse for you that you were only in fun.\nLittle girls never indulged in that kind of fun when I was young. You\ndon't know what it is to be awakened out of a sound sleep, after a long\nand arduous journey, by two great girls coming bounce down on you.\"\n\"I don't _know_, but I can _imagine_,\" said Anne eagerly. \"I'm sure it must\nhave been very disturbing. But then, there is our side of it too. Have\nyou any imagination, Miss Barry? If you have, just put yourself in\nour place. We didn't know there was anybody in that bed and you nearly\nscared us to death. It was simply awful the way we felt. And then we\ncouldn't sleep in the spare room after being promised. I suppose you are\nused to sleeping in spare rooms. But just imagine what you would feel\nlike if you were a little orphan girl who had never had such an honor.\"\nAll the snap had gone by this time. Miss Barry actually laughed--a\nsound which caused Diana, waiting in speechless anxiety in the kitchen\noutside, to give a great gasp of relief.\n\"I'm afraid my imagination is a little rusty--it's so long since I used\nit,\" she said. \"I dare say your claim to sympathy is just as strong as\nmine. It all depends on the way we look at it. Sit down here and tell me\nabout yourself.\"\n\"I am very sorry I can't,\" said Anne firmly. \"I would like to, because\nyou seem like an interesting lady, and you might even be a kindred\nspirit although you don't look very much like it. But it is my duty to\ngo home to Miss Marilla Cuthbert. Miss Marilla Cuthbert is a very kind\nlady who has taken me to bring up properly. She is doing her best, but\nit is very discouraging work. You must not blame her because I jumped on\nthe bed. But before I go I do wish you would tell me if you will forgive\nDiana and stay just as long as you meant to in Avonlea.\"\n\"I think perhaps I will if you will come over and talk to me\noccasionally,\" said Miss Barry.\nThat evening Miss Barry gave Diana a silver bangle bracelet and told the\nsenior members of the household that she had unpacked her valise.\n\"I've made up my mind to stay simply for the sake of getting better\nacquainted with that Anne-girl,\" she said frankly. \"She amuses me, and\nat my time of life an amusing person is a rarity.\"\nMarilla's only comment when she heard the story was, \"I told you so.\"\nThis was for Matthew's benefit.\nMiss Barry stayed her month out and over. She was a more agreeable guest\nthan usual, for Anne kept her in good humor. They became firm friends.\nWhen Miss Barry went away she said:\n\"Remember, you Anne-girl, when you come to town you're to visit me and\nI'll put you in my very sparest spare-room bed to sleep.\"\n\"Miss Barry was a kindred spirit, after all,\" Anne confided to Marilla.",

The maples in Lover's Lane were red budded\nand little curly ferns pushed up around the Dryad's Bubble. Away up in\nthe barrens, behind Mr. Silas Sloane's place, the Mayflowers blossomed\nout, pink and white stars of sweetness under their brown leaves. All the\nschool girls and boys had one golden afternoon gathering them, coming\nhome in the clear, echoing twilight with arms and baskets full of\nflowery spoil.\n\"I'm so sorry for people who live in lands where there are no\nMayflowers,\" said Anne. \"Diana says perhaps they have something better,\nbut there couldn't be anything better than Mayflowers, could there,\nMarilla? And Diana says if they don't know what they are like they don't\nmiss them. But I think that is the saddest thing of all. I think it\nwould be _tragic_, Marilla, not to know what Mayflowers are like and _not_\nto miss them. Do you know what I think Mayflowers are, Marilla? I think\nthey must be the souls of the flowers that died last summer and this\nis their heaven. But we had a splendid time today, Marilla. We had our\nlunch down in a big mossy hollow by an old well--such a _romantic_ spot.\nCharlie Sloane dared Arty Gillis to jump over it, and Arty did because\nhe wouldn't take a dare. Nobody would in school. It is very _fashionable_\nto dare. Mr. Phillips gave all the Mayflowers he found to Prissy Andrews\nand I heard him to say 'sweets to the sweet.' He got that out of a\nbook, I know; but it shows he has some imagination. I was offered some\nMayflowers too, but I rejected them with scorn. I can't tell you the\nperson's name because I have vowed never to let it cross my lips. We\nmade wreaths of the Mayflowers and put them on our hats; and when the\ntime came to go home we marched in procession down the road, two by two,\nwith our bouquets and wreaths, singing 'My Home on the Hill.' Oh, it was\nso thrilling, Marilla. All Mr. Silas Sloane's folks rushed out to see us\nand everybody we met on the road stopped and stared after us. We made a\nreal sensation.\"",

The\nwalls were as white, the pincushion as hard, the chairs as stiffly\nand yellowly upright as ever. Yet the whole character of the room was\naltered. It was full of a new vital, pulsing personality that seemed to\npervade it and to be quite independent of schoolgirl books and dresses\nand ribbons, and even of the cracked blue jug full of apple blossoms\non the table. It was as if all the dreams, sleeping and waking, of its\nvivid occupant had taken a visible although unmaterial form and had\ntapestried the bare room with splendid filmy tissues of rainbow and\nmoonshine. Presently Marilla came briskly in with some of Anne's freshly\nironed school aprons. She hung them over a chair and sat down with\na short sigh. She had had one of her headaches that afternoon, and\nalthough the pain had gone she felt weak and \"tuckered out,\" as she\nexpressed it. Anne looked at her with eyes limpid with sympathy.",

A New Departure in Flavorings\nDEAR ME, there is nothing but meetings and partings in this world, as\nMrs. Lynde says,\" remarked Anne plaintively, putting her slate and books\ndown on the kitchen table on the last day of June and wiping her red\neyes with a very damp handkerchief. \"Wasn't it fortunate, Marilla, that\nI took an extra handkerchief to school today? I had a presentiment that\nit would be needed.\"\n\"I never thought you were so fond of Mr. Phillips that you'd require two\nhandkerchiefs to dry your tears just because he was going away,\" said\nMarilla.\n\"I don't think I was crying because I was really so very fond of him,\"\nreflected Anne. \"I just cried because all the others did. It was\nRuby Gillis started it. Ruby Gillis has always declared she hated Mr.\nPhillips, but just as soon as he got up to make his farewell speech she\nburst into tears. Then all the girls began to cry, one after the other.\nI tried to hold out, Marilla. I tried to remember the time Mr. Phillips\nmade me sit with Gil--with a boy; and the time he spelled my name\nwithout an 'e' on the blackboard; and how he said I was the worst dunce\nhe ever saw at geometry and laughed at my spelling; and all the times he\nhad been so horrid and sarcastic; but somehow I couldn't, Marilla, and I\njust had to cry too. Jane Andrews has been talking for a month about how\nglad she'd be when Mr. Phillips went away and she declared she'd never\nshed a tear. Well, she was worse than any of us and had to borrow a\nhandkerchief from her brother--of course the boys didn't cry--because\nshe hadn't brought one of her own, not expecting to need it. Oh,\nMarilla, it was heartrending. Mr. Phillips made such a beautiful\nfarewell speech beginning, 'The time has come for us to part.' It was\nvery affecting. And he had tears in his eyes too, Marilla. Oh, I felt\ndreadfully sorry and remorseful for all the times I'd talked in school\nand drawn pictures of him on my slate and made fun of him and Prissy.\nI can tell you I wished I'd been a model pupil like Minnie Andrews. She\nhadn't anything on her conscience. The girls cried all the way home from\nschool. Carrie Sloane kept saying every few minutes, 'The time has come\nfor us to part,' and that would start us off again whenever we were in\nany danger of cheering up. I do feel dreadfully sad, Marilla. But one\ncan't feel quite in the depths of despair with two months' vacation\nbefore them, can they, Marilla? And besides, we met the new minister and\nhis wife coming from the station. For all I was feeling so bad about Mr.\nPhillips going away I couldn't help taking a little interest in a new\nminister, could I? His wife is very pretty. Not exactly regally lovely,\nof course--it wouldn't do, I suppose, for a minister to have a regally\nlovely wife, because it might set a bad example. Mrs. Lynde says the\nminister's wife over at Newbridge sets a very bad example because she\ndresses so fashionably. Our new minister's wife was dressed in blue\nmuslin with lovely puffed sleeves and a hat trimmed with roses.\nJane Andrews said she thought puffed sleeves were too worldly for\na minister's wife, but I didn't make any such uncharitable remark,\nMarilla, because I know what it is to long for puffed sleeves. Besides,\nshe's only been a minister's wife for a little while, so one should\nmake allowances, shouldn't they? They are going to board with Mrs. Lynde\nuntil the manse is ready.\"\nIf Marilla, in going down to Mrs. Lynde's that evening, was actuated by\nany motive save her avowed one of returning the quilting frames she had\nborrowed the preceding winter, it was an amiable weakness shared by most\nof the Avonlea people. Many a thing Mrs. Lynde had lent, sometimes\nnever expecting to see it again, came home that night in charge of the\nborrowers thereof. A new minister, and moreover a minister with a wife,\nwas a lawful object of curiosity in a quiet little country settlement\nwhere sensations were few and far between.\nOld Mr. Bentley, the minister whom Anne had found lacking in\nimagination, had been pastor of Avonlea for eighteen years. He was a\nwidower when he came, and a widower he remained, despite the fact that\ngossip regularly married him to this, that, or the other one, every year\nof his sojourn. In the preceding February he had resigned his charge and\ndeparted amid the regrets of his people, most of whom had the affection\nborn of long intercourse for their good old minister in spite of his\nshortcomings as an orator. Since then the Avonlea church had enjoyed a\nvariety of religious dissipation in listening to the many and various\ncandidates and \"supplies\" who came Sunday after Sunday to preach on\ntrial. These stood or fell by the judgment of the fathers and mothers\nin Israel; but a certain small, red-haired girl who sat meekly in the\ncorner of the old Cuthbert pew also had her opinions about them and\ndiscussed the same in full with Matthew, Marilla always declining from\nprinciple to criticize ministers in any shape or form.\n\"I don't think Mr. Smith would have done, Matthew\" was Anne's final\nsumming up. \"Mrs. Lynde says his delivery was so poor, but I think his\nworst fault was just like Mr. Bentley's--he had no imagination. And Mr.\nTerry had too much; he let it run away with him just as I did mine in\nthe matter of the Haunted Wood. Besides, Mrs. Lynde says his theology\nwasn't sound. Mr. Gresham was a very good man and a very religious man,\nbut he told too many funny stories and made the people laugh in church;\nhe was undignified, and you must have some dignity about a minister,\nmustn't you, Matthew? I thought Mr. Marshall was decidedly attractive;\nbut Mrs. Lynde says he isn't married, or even engaged, because she made\nspecial inquiries about him, and she says it would never do to have\na young unmarried minister in Avonlea, because he might marry in the\ncongregation and that would make trouble. Mrs. Lynde is a very farseeing\nwoman, isn't she, Matthew? I'm very glad they've called Mr. Allan. I\nliked him because his sermon was interesting and he prayed as if he\nmeant it and not just as if he did it because he was in the habit of it.\nMrs. Lynde says he isn't perfect, but she says she supposes we couldn't\nexpect a perfect minister for seven hundred and fifty dollars a year,\nand anyhow his theology is sound because she questioned him thoroughly\non all the points of doctrine. And she knows his wife's people and they\nare most respectable and the women are all good housekeepers. Mrs. Lynde\nsays that sound doctrine in the man and good housekeeping in the woman\nmake an ideal combination for a minister's family.\"\nThe new minister and his wife were a young, pleasant-faced couple, still\non their honeymoon, and full of all good and beautiful enthusiasms for\ntheir chosen lifework. Avonlea opened its heart to them from the start.",

            "text": "Old and young liked the frank, cheerful young man with his high ideals,\nand the bright, gentle little lady who assumed the mistress-ship of the\nmanse. With Mrs. Allan Anne fell promptly and wholeheartedly in love.\nShe had discovered another kindred spirit.\n\"Mrs. Allan is perfectly lovely,\" she announced one Sunday afternoon.\n\"She's taken our class and she's a splendid teacher. She said right away\nshe didn't think it was fair for the teacher to ask all the questions,\nand you know, Marilla, that is exactly what I've always thought. She\nsaid we could ask her any question we liked and I asked ever so many.\nI'm good at asking questions, Marilla.\"\n\"I believe you,\" was Marilla's emphatic comment.\n\"Nobody else asked any except Ruby Gillis, and she asked if there was\nto be a Sunday-school picnic this summer. I didn't think that was a\nvery proper question to ask because it hadn't any connection with the\nlesson--the lesson was about Daniel in the lions' den--but Mrs. Allan\njust smiled and said she thought there would be. Mrs. Allan has a\nlovely smile; she has such _exquisite_ dimples in her cheeks. I wish I had\ndimples in my cheeks, Marilla. I'm not half so skinny as I was when I\ncame here, but I have no dimples yet. If I had perhaps I could influence\npeople for good. Mrs. Allan said we ought always to try to influence\nother people for good. She talked so nice about everything. I never knew\nbefore that religion was such a cheerful thing. I always thought it\nwas kind of melancholy, but Mrs. Allan's isn't, and I'd like to be a\nChristian if I could be one like her. I wouldn't want to be one like Mr.\nSuperintendent Bell.\"\n\"It's very naughty of you to speak so about Mr. Bell,\" said Marilla\nseverely. \"Mr. Bell is a real good man.\"\n\"Oh, of course he's good,\" agreed Anne, \"but he doesn't seem to get any\ncomfort out of it. If I could be good I'd dance and sing all day because\nI was glad of it. I suppose Mrs. Allan is too old to dance and sing and\nof course it wouldn't be dignified in a minister's wife. But I can just\nfeel she's glad she's a Christian and that she'd be one even if she\ncould get to heaven without it.\"\n\"I suppose we must have Mr. and Mrs. Allan up to tea someday soon,\" said\nMarilla reflectively. \"They've been most everywhere but here. Let me\nsee. Next Wednesday would be a good time to have them. But don't say a\nword to Matthew about it, for if he knew they were coming he'd find some\nexcuse to be away that day. He'd got so used to Mr. Bentley he didn't\nmind him, but he's going to find it hard to get acquainted with a new\nminister, and a new minister's wife will frighten him to death.\"\n\"I'll be as secret as the dead,\" assured Anne. \"But oh, Marilla, will\nyou let me make a cake for the occasion? I'd love to do something for\nMrs. Allan, and you know I can make a pretty good cake by this time.\"\n\"You can make a layer cake,\" promised Marilla.\nMonday and Tuesday great preparations went on at Green Gables.\nHaving the minister and his wife to tea was a serious and important\nundertaking, and Marilla was determined not to be eclipsed by any of\nthe Avonlea housekeepers. Anne was wild with excitement and delight. She\ntalked it all over with Diana Tuesday night in the twilight, as they\nsat on the big red stones by the Dryad's Bubble and made rainbows in the\nwater with little twigs dipped in fir balsam.\n\"Everything is ready, Diana, except my cake which I'm to make in the\nmorning, and the baking-powder biscuits which Marilla will make just\nbefore teatime. I assure you, Diana, that Marilla and I have had a busy\ntwo days of it. It's such a responsibility having a minister's family to\ntea. I never went through such an experience before. You should just see\nour pantry. It's a sight to behold. We're going to have jellied chicken\nand cold tongue. We're to have two kinds of jelly, red and yellow, and\nwhipped cream and lemon pie, and cherry pie, and three kinds of cookies,\nand fruit cake, and Marilla's famous yellow plum preserves that she\nkeeps especially for ministers, and pound cake and layer cake, and\nbiscuits as aforesaid; and new bread and old both, in case the minister\nis dyspeptic and can't eat new. Mrs. Lynde says ministers are dyspeptic,\nbut I don't think Mr. Allan has been a minister long enough for it to\nhave had a bad effect on him. I just grow cold when I think of my layer\ncake. Oh, Diana, what if it shouldn't be good! I dreamed last night that\nI was chased all around by a fearful goblin with a big layer cake for a\nhead.\"\n\"It'll be good, all right,\" assured Diana, who was a very comfortable\nsort of friend. \"I'm sure that piece of the one you made that we had for\nlunch in Idlewild two weeks ago was perfectly elegant.\"\n\"Yes; but cakes have such a terrible habit of turning out bad just\nwhen you especially want them to be good,\" sighed Anne, setting a\nparticularly well-balsamed twig afloat. \"However, I suppose I shall\njust have to trust to Providence and be careful to put in the flour. Oh,\nlook, Diana, what a lovely rainbow! Do you suppose the dryad will come\nout after we go away and take it for a scarf?\"\n\"You know there is no such thing as a dryad,\" said Diana. Diana's mother\nhad found out about the Haunted Wood and had been decidedly angry over\nit. As a result Diana had abstained from any further imitative flights\nof imagination and did not think it prudent to cultivate a spirit of\nbelief even in harmless dryads.\n\"But it's so easy to imagine there is,\" said Anne. \"Every night before\nI go to bed, I look out of my window and wonder if the dryad is really\nsitting here, combing her locks with the spring for a mirror. Sometimes\nI look for her footprints in the dew in the morning. Oh, Diana, don't\ngive up your faith in the dryad!\"\nWednesday morning came. Anne got up at sunrise because she was too\nexcited to sleep. She had caught a severe cold in the head by reason of\nher dabbling in the spring on the preceding evening; but nothing short\nof absolute pneumonia could have quenched her interest in culinary\nmatters that morning. After breakfast she proceeded to make her cake.\nWhen she finally shut the oven door upon it she drew a long breath.\n\"I'm sure I haven't forgotten anything this time, Marilla. But do you\nthink it will rise? Just suppose perhaps the baking powder isn't good? I\nused it out of the new can. And Mrs. Lynde says you can never be sure of\ngetting good baking powder nowadays when everything is so adulterated.\nMrs. Lynde says the Government ought to take the matter up, but she says\nwe'll never see the day when a Tory Government will do it. Marilla, what\nif that cake doesn't rise?\"\n\"We'll have plenty without it\" was Marilla's unimpassioned way of\nlooking at the subject.\nThe cake did rise, however, and came out of the oven as light and\nfeathery as golden foam. Anne, flushed with delight, clapped it together\nwith layers of ruby jelly and, in imagination, saw Mrs. Allan eating it\nand possibly asking for another piece!\n\"You'll be using the best tea set, of course, Marilla,\" she said. \"Can I\nfix the table with ferns and wild roses?\"\n\"I think that's all nonsense,\" sniffed Marilla. \"In my opinion it's the\neatables that matter and not flummery decorations.\"\n\"Mrs. Barry had _her_ table decorated,\" said Anne, who was not entirely\nguiltless of the wisdom of the serpent, \"and the minister paid her an\nelegant compliment. He said it was a feast for the eye as well as the\npalate.\"\n\"Well, do as you like,\" said Marilla, who was quite determined not to\nbe surpassed by Mrs. Barry or anybody else. \"Only mind you leave enough\nroom for the dishes and the food.\"\nAnne laid herself out to decorate in a manner and after a fashion that\nshould leave Mrs. Barry's nowhere. Having abundance of roses and ferns\nand a very artistic taste of her own, she made that tea table such a\nthing of beauty that when the minister and his wife sat down to it they\nexclaimed in chorus over it loveliness.\n\"It's Anne's doings,\" said Marilla, grimly just; and Anne felt that Mrs.\nAllan's approving smile was almost too much happiness for this world.\nMatthew was there, having been inveigled into the party only goodness",

He had been in such a state of shyness and\nnervousness that Marilla had given him up in despair, but Anne took him\nin hand so successfully that he now sat at the table in his best clothes\nand white collar and talked to the minister not uninterestingly.\nHe never said a word to Mrs. Allan, but that perhaps was not to be\nexpected.\nAll went merry as a marriage bell until Anne's layer cake was passed.\nMrs. Allan, having already been helped to a bewildering variety,\ndeclined it. But Marilla, seeing the disappointment on Anne's face, said\nsmilingly:\n\"Oh, you must take a piece of this, Mrs. Allan. Anne made it on purpose\nfor you.\"\n\"In that case I must sample it,\" laughed Mrs. Allan, helping herself to\na plump triangle, as did also the minister and Marilla.\nMrs. Allan took a mouthful of hers and a most peculiar expression\ncrossed her face; not a word did she say, however, but steadily ate away\nat it. Marilla saw the expression and hastened to taste the cake.\n\"Anne Shirley!\" she exclaimed, \"what on earth did you put into that\ncake?\"\n\"Nothing but what the recipe said, Marilla,\" cried Anne with a look of\nanguish. \"Oh, isn't it all right?\"\n\"All right! It's simply horrible. Mr. Allan, don't try to eat it. Anne,\ntaste it yourself. What flavoring did you use?\"\n\"Vanilla,\" said Anne, her face scarlet with mortification after tasting\nthe cake. \"Only vanilla. Oh, Marilla, it must have been the baking\npowder. I had my suspicions of that bak--\"\n\"Baking powder fiddlesticks! Go and bring me the bottle of vanilla you\nused.\"\nAnne fled to the pantry and returned with a small bottle partially\nfilled with a brown liquid and labeled yellowly, \"Best Vanilla.\"\nMarilla took it, uncorked it, smelled it.\n\"Mercy on us, Anne, you've flavored that cake with _Anodyne Liniment_. I\nbroke the liniment bottle last week and poured what was left into an\nold empty vanilla bottle. I suppose it's partly my fault--I should have\nwarned you--but for pity's sake why couldn't you have smelled it?\"\nAnne dissolved into tears under this double disgrace.\n\"I couldn't--I had such a cold!\" and with this she fairly fled to the\ngable chamber, where she cast herself on the bed and wept as one who\nrefuses to be comforted.\nPresently a light step sounded on the stairs and somebody entered the\nroom.\n\"Oh, Marilla,\" sobbed Anne, without looking up, \"I'm disgraced forever.\nI shall never be able to live this down. It will get out--things always\ndo get out in Avonlea. Diana will ask me how my cake turned out and I\nshall have to tell her the truth. I shall always be pointed at as the\ngirl who flavored a cake with anodyne liniment. Gil--the boys in school\nwill never get over laughing at it. Oh, Marilla, if you have a spark\nof Christian pity don't tell me that I must go down and wash the dishes\nafter this. I'll wash them when the minister and his wife are gone, but\nI cannot ever look Mrs. Allan in the face again. Perhaps she'll think I\ntried to poison her. Mrs. Lynde says she knows an orphan girl who tried\nto poison her benefactor. But the liniment isn't poisonous. It's meant\nto be taken internally--although not in cakes. Won't you tell Mrs. Allan\nso, Marilla?\"\n\"Suppose you jump up and tell her so yourself,\" said a merry voice.\nAnne flew up, to find Mrs. Allan standing by her bed, surveying her with\nlaughing eyes.\n\"My dear little girl, you mustn't cry like this,\" she said, genuinely\ndisturbed by Anne's tragic face. \"Why, it's all just a funny mistake\nthat anybody might make.\"\n\"Oh, no, it takes me to make such a mistake,\" said Anne forlornly. \"And\nI wanted to have that cake so nice for you, Mrs. Allan.\"\n\"Yes, I know, dear. And I assure you I appreciate your kindness and\nthoughtfulness just as much as if it had turned out all right. Now,\nyou mustn't cry any more, but come down with me and show me your flower\ngarden. Miss Cuthbert tells me you have a little plot all your own. I\nwant to see it, for I'm very much interested in flowers.\"\nAnne permitted herself to be led down and comforted, reflecting that it\nwas really providential that Mrs. Allan was a kindred spirit. Nothing\nmore was said about the liniment cake, and when the guests went away\nAnne found that she had enjoyed the evening more than could have been\nexpected, considering that terrible incident. Nevertheless, she sighed\ndeeply.\n\"Marilla, isn't it nice to think that tomorrow is a new day with no\nmistakes in it yet?\"\n\"I'll warrant you'll make plenty in it,\" said Marilla. \"I never saw your\nbeat for making mistakes, Anne.\"\n\"Yes, and well I know it,\" admitted Anne mournfully. \"But have you ever\nnoticed one encouraging thing about me, Marilla? I never make the same\nmistake twice.\"\n\"I don't know as that's much benefit when you're always making new\nones.\"\n\"Oh, don't you see, Marilla? There must be a limit to the mistakes one\nperson can make, and when I get to the end of them, then I'll be through\nwith them. That's a very comforting thought.\"\n\"Well, you'd better go and give that cake to the pigs,\" said Marilla.",

Now?\" asked\nMarilla, when Anne had just come in from a run to the post office. \"Have\nyou discovered another kindred spirit?\" Excitement hung around Anne like\na garment, shone in her eyes, kindled in every feature. She had come\ndancing up the lane, like a wind-blown sprite, through the mellow\nsunshine and lazy shadows of the August evening.\n\"No, Marilla, but oh, what do you think? I am invited to tea at the\nmanse tomorrow afternoon! Mrs. Allan left the letter for me at the post\noffice. Just look at it, Marilla. 'Miss Anne Shirley, Green Gables.'\nThat is the first time I was ever called 'Miss.' Such a thrill as it\ngave me! I shall cherish it forever among my choicest treasures.\"\n\"Mrs. Allan told me she meant to have all the members of her\nSunday-school class to tea in turn,\" said Marilla, regarding the\nwonderful event very coolly. \"You needn't get in such a fever over it.\nDo learn to take things calmly, child.\"\nFor Anne to take things calmly would have been to change her nature. All\n\"spirit and fire and dew,\" as she was, the pleasures and pains of life\ncame to her with trebled intensity. Marilla felt this and was vaguely\ntroubled over it, realizing that the ups and downs of existence would\nprobably bear hardly on this impulsive soul and not sufficiently\nunderstanding that the equally great capacity for delight might more\nthan compensate. Therefore Marilla conceived it to be her duty to drill\nAnne into a tranquil uniformity of disposition as impossible and alien\nto her as to a dancing sunbeam in one of the brook shallows. She did not\nmake much headway, as she sorrowfully admitted to herself. The downfall\nof some dear hope or plan plunged Anne into \"deeps of affliction.\" The\nfulfillment thereof exalted her to dizzy realms of delight. Marilla had\nalmost begun to despair of ever fashioning this waif of the world into\nher model little girl of demure manners and prim deportment. Neither\nwould she have believed that she really liked Anne much better as she\nwas.",

One clear star\nhung over the orchard and the fireflies were flitting over in Lover's\nLane, in and out among the ferns and rustling boughs. Anne watched them\nas she talked and somehow felt that wind and stars and fireflies were\nall tangled up together into something unutterably sweet and enchanting.\n\"Oh, Marilla, I've had a most _fascinating_ time. I feel that I have not\nlived in vain and I shall always feel like that even if I should never\nbe invited to tea at a manse again. When I got there Mrs. Allan met me\nat the door. She was dressed in the sweetest dress of pale-pink organdy,\nwith dozens of frills and elbow sleeves, and she looked just like a\nseraph. I really think I'd like to be a minister's wife when I grow up,\nMarilla. A minister mightn't mind my red hair because he wouldn't be\nthinking of such worldly things. But then of course one would have to\nbe naturally good and I'll never be that, so I suppose there's no use in\nthinking about it. Some people are naturally good, you know, and others\nare not. I'm one of the others. Mrs. Lynde says I'm full of original\nsin. No matter how hard I try to be good I can never make such a success\nof it as those who are naturally good. It's a good deal like geometry,\nI expect. But don't you think the trying so hard ought to count for\nsomething? Mrs. Allan is one of the naturally good people. I love her\npassionately. You know there are some people, like Matthew and Mrs.\nAllan that you can love right off without any trouble. And there are\nothers, like Mrs. Lynde, that you have to try very hard to love. You\nknow you _ought_ to love them because they know so much and are such\nactive workers in the church, but you have to keep reminding yourself of\nit all the time or else you forget. There was another little girl at the\nmanse to tea, from the White Sands Sunday school. Her name was Laurette\nBradley, and she was a very nice little girl. Not exactly a kindred\nspirit, you know, but still very nice. We had an elegant tea, and I\nthink I kept all the rules of etiquette pretty well. After tea Mrs.\nAllan played and sang and she got Lauretta and me to sing too.\nMrs. Allan says I have a good voice and she says I must sing in the\nSunday-school choir after this. You can't think how I was thrilled at\nthe mere thought. I've longed so to sing in the Sunday-school choir,\nas Diana does, but I feared it was an honor I could never aspire to.\nLauretta had to go home early because there is a big concert in the\nWhite Sands Hotel tonight and her sister is to recite at it. Lauretta\nsays that the Americans at the hotel give a concert every fortnight in\naid of the Charlottetown hospital, and they ask lots of the White\nSands people to recite. Lauretta said she expected to be asked herself\nsomeday. I just gazed at her in awe. After she had gone Mrs. Allan and I\nhad a heart-to-heart talk. I told her everything--about Mrs. Thomas and\nthe twins and Katie Maurice and Violetta and coming to Green Gables and\nmy troubles over geometry. And would you believe it, Marilla? Mrs.\nAllan told me she was a dunce at geometry too. You don't know how that\nencouraged me. Mrs. Lynde came to the manse just before I left, and what\ndo you think, Marilla? The trustees have hired a new teacher and it's\na lady. Her name is Miss Muriel Stacy. Isn't that a romantic name? Mrs.\nLynde says they've never had a female teacher in Avonlea before and she\nthinks it is a dangerous innovation. But I think it will be splendid\nto have a lady teacher, and I really don't see how I'm going to live\nthrough the two weeks before school begins. I'm so impatient to see\nher.\"",

This presently took the form of \"daring.\"\nDaring was the fashionable amusement among the Avonlea small fry just\nthen. It had begun among the boys, but soon spread to the girls, and all\nthe silly things that were done in Avonlea that summer because the doers\nthereof were \"dared\" to do them would fill a book by themselves.\nFirst of all Carrie Sloane dared Ruby Gillis to climb to a certain point\nin the huge old willow tree before the front door; which Ruby Gillis,\nalbeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said\ntree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she\nshould tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the\naforesaid Carrie Sloane. Then Josie Pye dared Jane Andrews to hop on her\nleft leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right\nfoot to the ground; which Jane Andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out\nat the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.\nJosie's triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,\nAnne Shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which\nbounded the garden to the east. Now, to \"walk\" board fences requires\nmore skill and steadiness of head and heel than one might suppose who\nhas never tried it. But Josie Pye, if deficient in some qualities\nthat make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly\ncultivated, for walking board fences. Josie walked the Barry fence with\nan airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that\nwasn't worth a \"dare.\" Reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for\nmost of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things\nthemselves in their efforts to walk fences.

You\nfind out how many friends you have. Why, even Superintendent Bell came\nto see me, and he's really a very fine man. Not a kindred spirit, of\ncourse; but still I like him and I'm awfully sorry I ever criticized his\nprayers. I believe now he really does mean them, only he has got into\nthe habit of saying them as if he didn't. He could get over that if he'd\ntake a little trouble. I gave him a good broad hint. I told him how hard\nI tried to make my own little private prayers interesting. He told me\nall about the time he broke his ankle when he was a boy. It does seem\nso strange to think of Superintendent Bell ever being a boy. Even my\nimagination has its limits, for I can't imagine _that_. When I try to\nimagine him as a boy I see him with gray whiskers and spectacles, just\nas he looks in Sunday school, only small. Now, it's so easy to imagine\nMrs. Allan as a little girl. Mrs. Allan has been to see me fourteen\ntimes. Isn't that something to be proud of, Marilla? When a minister's\nwife has so many claims on her time! She is such a cheerful person to\nhave visit you, too. She never tells you it's your own fault and she\nhopes you'll be a better girl on account of it. Mrs. Lynde always told\nme that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that\nmade me feel she might hope I'd be a better girl but didn't really\nbelieve I would. Even Josie Pye came to see me. I received her as\npolitely as I could, because I think she was sorry she dared me to walk\na ridgepole. If I had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden\nof remorse all her life. Diana has been a faithful friend. She's been\nover every day to cheer my lonely pillow. But oh, I shall be so glad\nwhen I can go to school for I've heard such exciting things about the\nnew teacher. The girls all think she is perfectly sweet. Diana says she\nhas the loveliest fair curly hair and such fascinating eyes. She dresses\nbeautifully, and her sleeve puffs are bigger than anybody else's in\nAvonlea. Every other Friday afternoon she has recitations and everybody\nhas to say a piece or take part in a dialogue. Oh, it's just glorious to\nthink of it. Josie Pye says she hates it but that is just because Josie\nhas so little imagination. Diana and Ruby Gillis and Jane Andrews are\npreparing a dialogue, called 'A Morning Visit,' for next Friday. And the\nFriday afternoons they don't have recitations Miss Stacy takes them\nall to the woods for a 'field' day and they study ferns and flowers\nand birds. And they have physical culture exercises every morning and\nevening. Mrs. Lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all\ncomes of having a lady teacher. But I think it must be splendid and I\nbelieve I shall find that Miss Stacy is a kindred spirit.\"",

Of\ncourse it's real nice to be getting up a concert. We're going to have\nsix choruses and Diana is to sing a solo. I'm in two dialogues--'The\nSociety for the Suppression of Gossip' and 'The Fairy Queen.' The boys\nare going to have a dialogue too. And I'm to have two recitations,\nMarilla. I just tremble when I think of it, but it's a nice thrilly kind\nof tremble. And we're to have a tableau at the last--'Faith, Hope and\nCharity.' Diana and Ruby and I are to be in it, all draped in white with\nflowing hair. I'm to be Hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes\nuplifted. I'm going to practice my recitations in the garret. Don't be\nalarmed if you hear me groaning. I have to groan heartrendingly in one\nof them, and it's really hard to get up a good artistic groan, Marilla.\nJosie Pye is sulky because she didn't get the part she wanted in\nthe dialogue. She wanted to be the fairy queen. That would have been\nridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as Josie? Fairy\nqueens must be slender. Jane Andrews is to be the queen and I am to be\none of her maids of honor. Josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is\njust as ridiculous as a fat one, but I do not let myself mind what Josie\nsays. I'm to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and Ruby Gillis\nis going to lend me her slippers because I haven't any of my own. It's\nnecessary for fairies to have slippers, you know. You couldn't imagine\na fairy wearing boots, could you? Especially with copper toes? We are\ngoing to decorate the hall with creeping spruce and fir mottoes with\npink tissue-paper roses in them. And we are all to march in two by two\nafter the audience is seated, while Emma White plays a march on the\norgan. Oh, Marilla, I know you are not so enthusiastic about it as I am,\nbut don't you hope your little Anne will distinguish herself?\"\n\"All I hope is that you'll behave yourself.

Presently they came trooping\nthrough the hall and out into the kitchen, laughing and chattering\ngaily. They did not see Matthew, who shrank bashfully back into the\nshadows beyond the woodbox with a boot in one hand and a bootjack in the\nother, and he watched them shyly for the aforesaid ten minutes as they\nput on caps and jackets and talked about the dialogue and the concert.\nAnne stood among them, bright eyed and animated as they; but Matthew\nsuddenly became conscious that there was something about her different\nfrom her mates. And what worried Matthew was that the difference\nimpressed him as being something that should not exist. Anne had a\nbrighter face, and bigger, starrier eyes, and more delicate features\nthan the other; even shy, unobservant Matthew had learned to take note\nof these things; but the difference that disturbed him did not consist\nin any of these respects. Then in what did it consist?\nMatthew was haunted by this question long after the girls had gone, arm\nin arm, down the long, hard-frozen lane and Anne had betaken herself\nto her books. He could not refer it to Marilla, who, he felt, would be\nquite sure to sniff scornfully and remark that the only difference she\nsaw between Anne and the other girls was that they sometimes kept their\ntongues quiet while Anne never did. This, Matthew felt, would be no\ngreat help.\nHe had recourse to his pipe that evening to help him study it out, much\nto Marilla's disgust. After two hours of smoking and hard reflection\nMatthew arrived at a solution of his problem. Anne was not dressed like\nthe other girls!\nThe more Matthew thought about the matter the more he was convinced that\nAnne never had been dressed like the other girls--never since she had\ncome to Green Gables. Marilla kept her clothed in plain, dark dresses,\nall made after the same unvarying pattern. If Matthew knew there was\nsuch a thing as fashion in dress it was as much as he did; but he was\nquite sure that Anne's sleeves did not look at all like the sleeves the\nother girls wore. He recalled the cluster of little girls he had seen\naround her that evening--all gay in waists of red and blue and pink\nand white--and he wondered why Marilla always kept her so plainly and\nsoberly gowned.\nOf course, it must be all right. Marilla knew best and Marilla was\nbringing her up. Probably some wise, inscrutable motive was to be served\nthereby. But surely it would do no harm to let the child have one pretty\ndress--something like Diana Barry always wore. Matthew decided that\nhe would give her one; that surely could not be objected to as an\nunwarranted putting in of his oar. Christmas was only a fortnight off.\nA nice new dress would be the very thing for a present. Matthew, with a\nsigh of satisfaction, put away his pipe and went to bed, while Marilla\nopened all the doors and aired the house.",

            "text": "The very next evening Matthew betook himself to Carmody to buy the\ndress, determined to get the worst over and have done with it. It would\nbe, he felt assured, no trifling ordeal. There were some things Matthew\ncould buy and prove himself no mean bargainer; but he knew he would be\nat the mercy of shopkeepers when it came to buying a girl's dress.\nAfter much cogitation Matthew resolved to go to Samuel Lawson's store\ninstead of William Blair's. To be sure, the Cuthberts always had gone to\nWilliam Blair's; it was almost as much a matter of conscience with them\nas to attend the Presbyterian church and vote Conservative. But William\nBlair's two daughters frequently waited on customers there and Matthew\nheld them in absolute dread. He could contrive to deal with them when he\nknew exactly what he wanted and could point it out; but in such a matter\nas this, requiring explanation and consultation, Matthew felt that he\nmust be sure of a man behind the counter. So he would go to Lawson's,\nwhere Samuel or his son would wait on him.\nAlas! Matthew did not know that Samuel, in the recent expansion of his\nbusiness, had set up a lady clerk also; she was a niece of his wife's\nand a very dashing young person indeed, with a huge, drooping pompadour,\nbig, rolling brown eyes, and a most extensive and bewildering smile. She\nwas dressed with exceeding smartness and wore several bangle bracelets\nthat glittered and rattled and tinkled with every movement of her hands.\nMatthew was covered with confusion at finding her there at all; and\nthose bangles completely wrecked his wits at one fell swoop.\n\"What can I do for you this evening, Mr. Cuthbert?\" Miss Lucilla Harris\ninquired, briskly and ingratiatingly, tapping the counter with both\nhands.\n\"Have you any--any--any--well now, say any garden rakes?\" stammered\nMatthew.\nMiss Harris looked somewhat surprised, as well she might, to hear a man\ninquiring for garden rakes in the middle of December.\n\"I believe we have one or two left over,\" she said, \"but they're\nupstairs in the lumber room. I'll go and see.\" During her absence\nMatthew collected his scattered senses for another effort.\nWhen Miss Harris returned with the rake and cheerfully inquired:\n\"Anything else tonight, Mr. Cuthbert?\" Matthew took his courage in\nboth hands and replied: \"Well now, since you suggest it, I might as\nwell--take--that is--look at--buy some--some hayseed.\"\nMiss Harris had heard Matthew Cuthbert called odd. She now concluded\nthat he was entirely crazy.\n\"We only keep hayseed in the spring,\" she explained loftily. \"We've none\non hand just now.\"\n\"Oh, certainly--certainly--just as you say,\" stammered unhappy\nMatthew, seizing the rake and making for the door. At the threshold he\nrecollected that he had not paid for it and he turned miserably back.\nWhile Miss Harris was counting out his change he rallied his powers for\na final desperate attempt.\n\"Well now--if it isn't too much trouble--I might as well--that is--I'd\nlike to look at--at--some sugar.\"\n\"White or brown?\" queried Miss Harris patiently.\n\"Oh--well now--brown,\" said Matthew feebly.\n\"There's a barrel of it over there,\" said Miss Harris, shaking her\nbangles at it. \"It's the only kind we have.\"\n\"I'll--I'll take twenty pounds of it,\" said Matthew, with beads of\nperspiration standing on his forehead.\nMatthew had driven halfway home before he was his own man again. It had\nbeen a gruesome experience, but it served him right, he thought, for\ncommitting the heresy of going to a strange store. When he reached\nhome he hid the rake in the tool house, but the sugar he carried in to\nMarilla.",

Jerry's gone and I've made my cake long ago. It's not\ngood sugar, either--it's coarse and dark--William Blair doesn't usually\nkeep sugar like that.\"\n\"I--I thought it might come in handy sometime,\" said Matthew, making\ngood his escape.\nWhen Matthew came to think the matter over he decided that a woman was\nrequired to cope with the situation. Marilla was out of the question.\nMatthew felt sure she would throw cold water on his project at once.\nRemained only Mrs. Lynde; for of no other woman in Avonlea would Matthew\nhave dared to ask advice. To Mrs. Lynde he went accordingly, and that\ngood lady promptly took the matter out of the harassed man's hands.\n\"Pick out a dress for you to give Anne? To be sure I will. I'm going to\nCarmody tomorrow and I'll attend to it. Have you something particular in\nmind? No? Well, I'll just go by my own judgment then. I believe a nice\nrich brown would just suit Anne, and William Blair has some new gloria\nin that's real pretty. Perhaps you'd like me to make it up for her, too,\nseeing that if Marilla was to make it Anne would probably get wind of it\nbefore the time and spoil the surprise? Well, I'll do it. No, it isn't\na mite of trouble. I like sewing. I'll make it to fit my niece, Jenny\nGillis, for she and Anne are as like as two peas as far as figure goes.\"\n\"Well now, I'm much obliged,\" said Matthew, \"and--and--I dunno--but I'd\nlike--I think they make the sleeves different nowadays to what they used\nto be. If it wouldn't be asking too much I--I'd like them made in the\nnew way.\"\n\"Puffs? Of course. You needn't worry a speck more about it, Matthew.\nI'll make it up in the very latest fashion,\" said Mrs. Lynde. To herself\nshe added when Matthew had gone:\n\"It'll be a real satisfaction to see that poor child wearing something\ndecent for once. The way Marilla dresses her is positively ridiculous,\nthat's what, and I've ached to tell her so plainly a dozen times. I've\nheld my tongue though, for I can see Marilla doesn't want advice and she\nthinks she knows more about bringing children up than I do for all\nshe's an old maid. But that's always the way. Folks that has brought up\nchildren know that there's no hard and fast method in the world that'll\nsuit every child. But them as never have think it's all as plain and\neasy as Rule of Three--just set your three terms down so fashion, and\nthe sum 'll work out correct. But flesh and blood don't come under the",

Marilla behaved pretty well on the\nwhole, although it is very likely she distrusted Mrs. Lynde's diplomatic\nexplanation that she had made the dress because Matthew was afraid Anne\nwould find out about it too soon if Marilla made it.\n\"So this is what Matthew has been looking so mysterious over and\ngrinning about to himself for two weeks, is it?\" she said a little\nstiffly but tolerantly. \"I knew he was up to some foolishness. Well, I\nmust say I don't think Anne needed any more dresses. I made her three\ngood, warm, serviceable ones this fall, and anything more is sheer\nextravagance. There's enough material in those sleeves alone to make a\nwaist, I declare there is. You'll just pamper Anne's vanity, Matthew,\nand she's as vain as a peacock now. Well, I hope she'll be satisfied\nat last, for I know she's been hankering after those silly sleeves ever\nsince they came in, although she never said a word after the first. The\npuffs have been getting bigger and more ridiculous right along; they're\nas big as balloons now. Next year anybody who wears them will have to go\nthrough a door sideways.\"\nChristmas morning broke on a beautiful white world. It had been a very\nmild December and people had looked forward to a green Christmas; but\njust enough snow fell softly in the night to transfigure Avonlea. Anne\npeeped out from her frosted gable window with delighted eyes. The firs\nin the Haunted Wood were all feathery and wonderful; the birches\nand wild cherry trees were outlined in pearl; the plowed fields were\nstretches of snowy dimples; and there was a crisp tang in the air that\nwas glorious. Anne ran downstairs singing until her voice reechoed\nthrough Green Gables.\n\"Merry Christmas, Marilla! Merry Christmas, Matthew! Isn't it a lovely\nChristmas? I'm so glad it's white. Any other kind of Christmas doesn't\nseem real, does it? I don't like green Christmases. They're not\ngreen--they're just nasty faded browns and grays. What makes people call\nthem green? Why--why--Matthew, is that for me? Oh, Matthew!\"\nMatthew had sheepishly unfolded the dress from its paper swathings and\nheld it out with a deprecatory glance at Marilla, who feigned to be\ncontemptuously filling the teapot, but nevertheless watched the scene\nout of the corner of her eye with a rather interested air.\nAnne took the dress and looked at it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty\nit was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt\nwith dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pintucked in the\nmost fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck.\nBut the sleeves--they were the crowning glory! Long elbow cuffs, and\nabove them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of shirring and bows of\nbrown-silk ribbon.\n\"That's a Christmas present for you, Anne,\" said Matthew shyly.\n\"Why--why--Anne, don't you like it? Well now--well now.\"\nFor Anne's eyes had suddenly filled with tears.\n\"Like it! Oh, Matthew!\" Anne laid the dress over a chair and clasped\nher hands. \"Matthew, it's perfectly exquisite. Oh, I can never thank you\nenough. Look at those sleeves! Oh, it seems to me this must be a happy\ndream.\"\n\"Well, well, let us have breakfast,\" interrupted Marilla. \"I must say,\nAnne, I don't think you needed the dress; but since Matthew has got it\nfor you, see that you take good care of it. There's a hair ribbon Mrs.\nLynde left for you. It's brown, to match the dress. Come now, sit in.\"\n\"I don't see how I'm going to eat breakfast,\" said Anne rapturously.\n\"Breakfast seems so commonplace at such an exciting moment. I'd rather\nfeast my eyes on that dress. I'm so glad that puffed sleeves are still\nfashionable. It did seem to me that I'd never get over it if they went\nout before I had a dress with them. I'd never have felt quite satisfied,\nyou see. It was lovely of Mrs. Lynde to give me the ribbon too. I feel\nthat I ought to be a very good girl indeed. It's at times like this I'm\nsorry I'm not a model little girl; and I always resolve that I will\nbe in future. But somehow it's hard to carry out your resolutions when\nirresistible temptations come. Still, I really will make an extra effort\nafter this.\"",

On Anne's birthday they were tripping lightly\ndown it, keeping eyes and ears alert amid all their chatter, for Miss\nStacy had told them that they must soon write a composition on \"A\nWinter's Walk in the Woods,\" and it behooved them to be observant.\n\"Just think, Diana, I'm thirteen years old today,\" remarked Anne in an\nawed voice. \"I can scarcely realize that I'm in my teens. When I woke\nthis morning it seemed to me that everything must be different. You've\nbeen thirteen for a month, so I suppose it doesn't seem such a novelty\nto you as it does to me. It makes life seem so much more interesting.\nIn two more years I'll be really grown up. It's a great comfort to think\nthat I'll be able to use big words then without being laughed at.\"\n\"Ruby Gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as she's fifteen,\"\nsaid Diana.\n\"Ruby Gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,\" said Anne disdainfully.\n\"She's actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a\ntake-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. But I'm afraid that is an\nuncharitable speech. Mrs. Allan says we should never make uncharitable\nspeeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, don't they? I\nsimply can't talk about Josie Pye without making an uncharitable speech,\nso I never mention her at all. You may have noticed that. I'm trying to\nbe as much like Mrs. Allan as I possibly can, for I think she's perfect.\nMr. Allan thinks so too. Mrs. Lynde says he just worships the ground she\ntreads on and she doesn't really think it right for a minister to\nset his affections so much on a mortal being. But then, Diana, even\nministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody\nelse. I had such an interesting talk with Mrs. Allan about besetting\nsins last Sunday afternoon. There are just a few things it's proper\nto talk about on Sundays and that is one of them. My besetting sin is\nimagining too much and forgetting my duties. I'm striving very hard\nto overcome it and now that I'm really thirteen perhaps I'll get on\nbetter.\"\n\"In four more years we'll be able to put our hair up,\" said Diana.\n\"Alice Bell is only sixteen and she is wearing hers up, but I think\nthat's ridiculous. I shall wait until I'm seventeen.\"\n\"If I had Alice Bell's crooked nose,\" said Anne decidedly, \"I\nwouldn't--but there! I won't say what I was going to because it was\nextremely uncharitable. Besides, I was comparing it with my own nose and\nthat's vanity. I'm afraid I think too much about my nose ever since I\nheard that compliment about it long ago. It really is a great comfort to\nme. Oh, Diana, look, there's a rabbit. That's something to remember for\nour woods composition. I really think the woods are just as lovely in\nwinter as in summer. They're so white and still, as if they were asleep\nand dreaming pretty dreams.\"",

The idea of Miss Stacy telling us to write a\nstory out of our own heads!\"\n\"Why, it's as easy as wink,\" said Anne.\n\"It's easy for you because you have an imagination,\" retorted Diana,\n\"but what would you do if you had been born without one? I suppose you\nhave your composition all done?\"\nAnne nodded, trying hard not to look virtuously complacent and failing\nmiserably.\n\"I wrote it last Monday evening. It's called 'The Jealous Rival; or In\nDeath Not Divided.' I read it to Marilla and she said it was stuff and\nnonsense. Then I read it to Matthew and he said it was fine. That is\nthe kind of critic I like. It's a sad, sweet story. I just cried like\na child while I was writing it. It's about two beautiful maidens called\nCordelia Montmorency and Geraldine Seymour who lived in the same village\nand were devotedly attached to each other. Cordelia was a regal brunette\nwith a coronet of midnight hair and duskly flashing eyes. Geraldine was\na queenly blonde with hair like spun gold and velvety purple eyes.\"\n\"I never saw anybody with purple eyes,\" said Diana dubiously.\n\"Neither did I. I just imagined them. I wanted something out of the\ncommon. Geraldine had an alabaster brow too. I've found out what an\nalabaster brow is. That is one of the advantages of being thirteen. You\nknow so much more than you did when you were only twelve.\"\n\"Well, what became of Cordelia and Geraldine?\" asked Diana, who was\nbeginning to feel rather interested in their fate.\n\"They grew in beauty side by side until they were sixteen. Then Bertram\nDeVere came to their native village and fell in love with the fair\nGeraldine. He saved her life when her horse ran away with her in a\ncarriage, and she fainted in his arms and he carried her home three\nmiles; because, you understand, the carriage was all smashed up. I found\nit rather hard to imagine the proposal because I had no experience to\ngo by. I asked Ruby Gillis if she knew anything about how men proposed\nbecause I thought she'd likely be an authority on the subject, having so\nmany sisters married. Ruby told me she was hid in the hall pantry when\nMalcolm Andres proposed to her sister Susan. She said Malcolm told Susan\nthat his dad had given him the farm in his own name and then said, 'What\ndo you say, darling pet, if we get hitched this fall?' And Susan said,\n'Yes--no--I don't know--let me see'--and there they were, engaged as\nquick as that. But I didn't think that sort of a proposal was a very\nromantic one, so in the end I had to imagine it out as well as I could.\nI made it very flowery and poetical and Bertram went on his knees,\nalthough Ruby Gillis says it isn't done nowadays. Geraldine accepted\nhim in a speech a page long. I can tell you I took a lot of trouble\nwith that speech. I rewrote it five times and I look upon it as my\nmasterpiece. Bertram gave her a diamond ring and a ruby necklace\nand told her they would go to Europe for a wedding tour, for he was\nimmensely wealthy. But then, alas, shadows began to darken over their\npath. Cordelia was secretly in love with Bertram herself and when\nGeraldine told her about the engagement she was simply furious,\nespecially when she saw the necklace and the diamond ring. All her\naffection for Geraldine turned to bitter hate and she vowed that she\nshould never marry Bertram. But she pretended to be Geraldine's friend\nthe same as ever. One evening they were standing on the bridge over a\nrushing turbulent stream and Cordelia, thinking they were alone, pushed\nGeraldine over the brink with a wild, mocking, 'Ha, ha, ha.' But Bertram\nsaw it all and he at once plunged into the current, exclaiming, 'I\nwill save thee, my peerless Geraldine.' But alas, he had forgotten he\ncouldn't swim, and they were both drowned, clasped in each other's arms.\nTheir bodies were washed ashore soon afterwards. They were buried in the\none grave and their funeral was most imposing, Diana. It's so much\nmore romantic to end a story up with a funeral than a wedding. As for\nCordelia, she went insane with remorse and was shut up in a lunatic\nasylum. I thought that was a poetical retribution for her crime.\"",

I read one of\nmy stories to him and Mrs. Allan and they both agreed that the moral was\nexcellent. Only they laughed in the wrong places. I like it better when\npeople cry. Jane and Ruby almost always cry when I come to the pathetic\nparts. Diana wrote her Aunt Josephine about our club and her Aunt\nJosephine wrote back that we were to send her some of our stories. So\nwe copied out four of our very best and sent them. Miss Josephine Barry\nwrote back that she had never read anything so amusing in her life. That\nkind of puzzled us because the stories were all very pathetic and almost\neverybody died. But I'm glad Miss Barry liked them. It shows our club\nis doing some good in the world. Mrs. Allan says that ought to be our\nobject in everything. I do really try to make it my object but I forget\nso often when I'm having fun. I hope I shall be a little like Mrs. Allan\nwhen I grow up. Do you think there is any prospect of it, Marilla?\"\n\"I shouldn't say there was a great deal\" was Marilla's encouraging\nanswer. \"I'm sure Mrs. Allan was never such a silly, forgetful little\ngirl as you are.\"\n\"No; but she wasn't always so good as she is now either,\" said Anne\nseriously. \"She told me so herself--that is, she said she was a dreadful\nmischief when she was a girl and was always getting into scrapes.

Mrs. Lynde says she always feels\nshocked when she hears of anyone ever having been naughty, no matter how\nsmall they were. Mrs. Lynde says she once heard a minister confess that\nwhen he was a boy he stole a strawberry tart out of his aunt's pantry\nand she never had any respect for that minister again. Now, I wouldn't\nhave felt that way. I'd have thought that it was real noble of him to\nconfess it, and I'd have thought what an encouraging thing it would be\nfor small boys nowadays who do naughty things and are sorry for them\nto know that perhaps they may grow up to be ministers in spite of it.\nThat's how I'd feel, Marilla.\"\n\"The way I feel at present, Anne,\" said Marilla, \"is that it's high time\nyou had those dishes washed. You've taken half an hour longer than\nyou should with all your chattering. Learn to work first and talk",

He\nspoke so feelingly about them that it touched my heart. I wanted to buy\nsomething from him to help him in such a worthy object. Then all at once\nI saw the bottle of hair dye. The peddler said it was warranted to dye\nany hair a beautiful raven black and wouldn't wash off. In a trice I\nsaw myself with beautiful raven-black hair and the temptation was\nirresistible. But the price of the bottle was seventy-five cents and I\nhad only fifty cents left out of my chicken money. I think the peddler\nhad a very kind heart, for he said that, seeing it was me, he'd sell it\nfor fifty cents and that was just giving it away. So I bought it, and as\nsoon as he had gone I came up here and applied it with an old hairbrush",

The girls had discovered that if\nthe flat were pushed off from the landing place it would drift down\nwith the current under the bridge and finally strand itself on another\nheadland lower down which ran out at a curve in the pond. They had often\ngone down like this and nothing could be more convenient for playing\nElaine.\n\"Well, I'll be Elaine,\" said Anne, yielding reluctantly, for, although\nshe would have been delighted to play the principal character, yet\nher artistic sense demanded fitness for it and this, she felt, her\nlimitations made impossible. \"Ruby, you must be King Arthur and Jane\nwill be Guinevere and Diana must be Lancelot.

Do you suppose it's\nreally right to act like this? Mrs. Lynde says that all play-acting is\nabominably wicked.\"\n\"Ruby, you shouldn't talk about Mrs. Lynde,\" said Anne severely. \"It\nspoils the effect because this is hundreds of years before Mrs. Lynde\nwas born. Jane, you arrange this. It's silly for Elaine to be talking\nwhen she's dead.\"\nJane rose to the occasion. Cloth of gold for coverlet there was none,\nbut an old piano scarf of yellow Japanese crepe was an excellent\nsubstitute. A white lily was not obtainable just then, but the effect of\na tall blue iris placed in one of Anne's folded hands was all that could\nbe desired.\n\"Now, she's all ready,\" said Jane. \"We must kiss her quiet brows\nand, Diana, you say, 'Sister, farewell forever,' and Ruby, you say,\n'Farewell, sweet sister,' both of you as sorrowfully as you possibly\ncan. Anne, for goodness sake smile a little. You know Elaine 'lay as\nthough she smiled.' That's better. Now push the flat off.\"\nThe flat was accordingly pushed off, scraping roughly over an old\nembedded stake in the process. Diana and Jane and Ruby only waited long\nenough to see it caught in the current and headed for the bridge before\nscampering up through the woods, across the road, and down to the lower\nheadland where, as Lancelot and Guinevere and the King, they were to be\nin readiness to receive the lily maid.\nFor a few minutes Anne, drifting slowly down, enjoyed the romance of her\nsituation to the full. Then something happened not at all romantic. The\nflat began to leak. In a very few moments it was necessary for Elaine\nto scramble to her feet, pick up her cloth of gold coverlet and pall\nof blackest samite and gaze blankly at a big crack in the bottom of her\nbarge through which the water was literally pouring. That sharp stake at\nthe landing had torn off the strip of batting nailed on the flat. Anne\ndid not know this, but it did not take her long to realize that she was\nin a dangerous plight. At this rate the flat would fill and sink long\nbefore it could drift to the lower headland. Where were the oars? Left",

I just said, 'Dear God, please take the flat close to a pile\nand I'll do the rest,' over and over again. Under such circumstances you\ndon't think much about making a flowery prayer.

For a moment they stood still, white as sheets,\nfrozen with horror at the tragedy; then, shrieking at the tops of\ntheir voices, they started on a frantic run up through the woods, never\npausing as they crossed the main road to glance the way of the bridge.\nAnne, clinging desperately to her precarious foothold, saw their flying\nforms and heard their shrieks. Help would soon come, but meanwhile her\nposition was a very uncomfortable one.\nThe minutes passed by, each seeming an hour to the unfortunate lily\nmaid. Why didn't somebody come? Where had the girls gone? Suppose they\nhad fainted, one and all! Suppose nobody ever came! Suppose she grew so\ntired and cramped that she could hold on no longer! Anne looked at the\nwicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and\nshivered. Her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome\npossibilities to her.\nThen, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her\narms and wrists another moment, Gilbert Blythe came rowing under the\nbridge in Harmon Andrews's dory!\nGilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white\nscornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also\nscornful gray eyes.\n\"Anne Shirley! How on earth did you get there?\" he exclaimed.\nWithout waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended\nhis hand. There was no help for it; Anne, clinging to Gilbert Blythe's\nhand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious,\nin the stern with her arms full of dripping shawl and wet crepe. It was\ncertainly extremely difficult to be dignified under the circumstances!\n\"What has happened, Anne?\" asked Gilbert, taking up his oars.\n\"We were playing Elaine,\" explained Anne frigidly, without even looking\nat her rescuer, \"and I had to drift down to Camelot in the barge--I\nmean the flat. The flat began to leak and I climbed out on the pile.\nThe girls went for help. Will you be kind enough to row me to the\nlanding?\"\nGilbert obligingly rowed to the landing and Anne, disdaining assistance,\nsprang nimbly on shore.\n\"I'm very much obliged to you,\" she said haughtily as she turned away.\nBut Gilbert had also sprung from the boat and now laid a detaining hand\non her arm.\n\"Anne,\" he said hurriedly, \"look here. Can't we be good friends? I'm\nawfully sorry I made fun of your hair that time. I didn't mean to vex\nyou and I only meant it for a joke. Besides, it's so long ago. I think\nyour hair is awfully pretty now--honest I do. Let's be friends.\"\nFor a moment Anne hesitated. She had an odd, newly awakened\nconsciousness under all her outraged dignity that the half-shy,\nhalf-eager expression in Gilbert's hazel eyes was something that was\nvery good to see. Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the\nbitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering\ndetermination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her\nrecollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had\ncalled her \"carrots\" and had brought about her disgrace before the whole\nschool. Her resentment, which to other and older people might be as\nlaughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time\nseemingly. She hated Gilbert Blythe! She would never forgive him!\n\"No,\" she said coldly, \"I shall never be friends with you, Gilbert\nBlythe; and I don't want to be!\"\n\"All right!\" Gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his\ncheeks. \"I'll never ask you to be friends again, Anne Shirley. And I\ndon't care either!\"\nHe pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and Anne went up the steep,\nferny little path under the maples. She held her head very high, but\nshe was conscious of an odd feeling of regret. She almost wished she had\nanswered Gilbert differently. Of course, he had insulted her terribly,\nbut still--! Altogether, Anne rather thought it would be a relief to\nsit down and have a good cry. She was really quite unstrung, for the\nreaction from her fright and cramped clinging was making itself felt.\nHalfway up the path she met Jane and Diana rushing back to the pond in\na state narrowly removed from positive frenzy. They had found nobody at\nOrchard Slope, both Mr. and Mrs. Barry being away. Here Ruby Gillis had\nsuccumbed to hysterics, and was left to recover from them as best she\nmight, while Jane and Diana flew through the Haunted Wood and across the\nbrook to Green Gables. There they had found nobody either, for Marilla\nhad gone to Carmody and Matthew was making hay in the back field.\n\"Oh, Anne,\" gasped Diana, fairly falling on the former's neck\nand weeping with relief and delight, \"oh, Anne--we thought--you\nwere--drowned--and we felt like murderers--because we had made--you\nbe--Elaine. And Ruby is in hysterics--oh, Anne, how did you escape?\"\n\"I climbed up on one of the piles,\" explained Anne wearily, \"and Gilbert\nBlythe came along in Mr. Andrews's dory and brought me to land.\"\n\"Oh, Anne, how splendid of him! Why, it's so romantic!\" said Jane,\nfinding breath enough for utterance at last. \"Of course you'll speak to\nhim after this.\"\n\"Of course I won't,\" flashed Anne, with a momentary return of her old\nspirit. \"And I don't want ever to hear the word 'romantic' again, Jane\nAndrews. I'm awfully sorry you were so frightened, girls. It is all my\nfault. I feel sure I was born under an unlucky star. Everything I do\ngets me or my dearest friends into a scrape. We've gone and lost your\nfather's flat, Diana, and I have a presentiment that we'll not be\nallowed to row on the pond any more.\"",

The affair of\nthe amethyst brooch cured me of meddling with things that didn't belong\nto me. The Haunted Wood mistake cured me of letting my imagination run\naway with me. The liniment cake mistake cured me of carelessness in\ncooking. Dyeing my hair cured me of vanity. I never think about my hair\nand nose now--at least, very seldom.

From first to last it was crowded with delights.\nOn Wednesday Miss Barry took them to the Exhibition grounds and kept\nthem there all day.\n\"It was splendid,\" Anne related to Marilla later on. \"I never imagined\nanything so interesting. I don't really know which department was the\nmost interesting. I think I liked the horses and the flowers and the\nfancywork best. Josie Pye took first prize for knitted lace. I was\nreal glad she did. And I was glad that I felt glad, for it shows I'm\nimproving, don't you think, Marilla, when I can rejoice in Josie's\nsuccess? Mr. Harmon Andrews took second prize for Gravenstein apples\nand Mr. Bell took first prize for a pig. Diana said she thought it was\nridiculous for a Sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,\nbut I don't see why. Do you? She said she would always think of it after\nthis when he was praying so solemnly. Clara Louise MacPherson took a\nprize for painting, and Mrs. Lynde got first prize for homemade butter\nand cheese. So Avonlea was pretty well represented, wasn't it? Mrs.\nLynde was there that day, and I never knew how much I really liked her\nuntil I saw her familiar face among all those strangers. There\nwere thousands of people there, Marilla. It made me feel dreadfully\ninsignificant. And Miss Barry took us up to the grandstand to see\nthe horse races. Mrs. Lynde wouldn't go; she said horse racing was an\nabomination and, she being a church member, thought it her bounden duty\nto set a good example by staying away. But there were so many there I\ndon't believe Mrs. Lynde's absence would ever be noticed. I don't think,\nthough, that I ought to go very often to horse races, because they _are_\nawfully fascinating. Diana got so excited that she offered to bet me\nten cents that the red horse would win. I didn't believe he would, but\nI refused to bet, because I wanted to tell Mrs. Allan all about\neverything, and I felt sure it wouldn't do to tell her that. It's always\nwrong to do anything you can't tell the minister's wife. It's as good as\nan extra conscience to have a minister's wife for your friend. And I was\nvery glad I didn't bet, because the red horse _did_ win, and I would have\nlost ten cents. So you see that virtue was its own reward. We saw a man\ngo up in a balloon. I'd love to go up in a balloon, Marilla; it would\nbe simply thrilling; and we saw a man selling fortunes. You paid him ten\ncents and a little bird picked out your fortune for you. Miss Barry gave\nDiana and me ten cents each to have our fortunes told. Mine was that I\nwould marry a dark-complected man who was very wealthy, and I would go\nacross water to live. I looked carefully at all the dark men I saw after\nthat, but I didn't care much for any of them, and anyhow I suppose\nit's too early to be looking out for him yet. Oh, it was a\nnever-to-be-forgotten day, Marilla. I was so tired I couldn't sleep at\nnight. Miss Barry put us in the spare room, according to promise. It",

To Anne the evening was a glittering vision of\ndelight.\n\"Oh, Marilla, it was beyond description. I was so excited I couldn't\neven talk, so you may know what it was like. I just sat in enraptured\nsilence. Madame Selitsky was perfectly beautiful, and wore white satin\nand diamonds. But when she began to sing I never thought about anything\nelse. Oh, I can't tell you how I felt. But it seemed to me that it could\nnever be hard to be good any more. I felt like I do when I look up to\nthe stars. Tears came into my eyes, but, oh, they were such happy tears.\nI was so sorry when it was all over, and I told Miss Barry I didn't see\nhow I was ever to return to common life again. She said she thought if\nwe went over to the restaurant across the street and had an ice cream\nit might help me. That sounded so prosaic; but to my surprise I found\nit true. The ice cream was delicious, Marilla, and it was so lovely and\ndissipated to be sitting there eating it at eleven o'clock at night.\nDiana said she believed she was born for city life. Miss Barry asked\nme what my opinion was, but I said I would have to think it over very\nseriously before I could tell her what I really thought. So I thought it\nover after I went to bed. That is the best time to think things out. And\nI came to the conclusion, Marilla, that I wasn't born for city life and\nthat I was glad of it. It's nice to be eating ice cream at brilliant\nrestaurants at eleven o'clock at night once in a while; but as a regular\nthing I'd rather be in the east gable at eleven, sound asleep, but kind\nof knowing even in my sleep that the stars were shining outside and that\nthe wind was blowing in the firs across the brook. I told Miss Barry\nso at breakfast the next morning and she laughed. Miss Barry generally\nlaughed at anything I said, even when I said the most solemn things. I\ndon't think I liked it, Marilla, because I wasn't trying to be funny.\nBut she is a most hospitable lady and treated us royally.\"",

But Miss Barry was pleased, and she stood on her\nveranda and watched the buggy out of sight. Then she went back into her\nbig house with a sigh. It seemed very lonely, lacking those fresh young\nlives. Miss Barry was a rather selfish old lady, if the truth must\nbe told, and had never cared much for anybody but herself. She valued\npeople only as they were of service to her or amused her. Anne had\namused her, and consequently stood high in the old lady's good graces.\nBut Miss Barry found herself thinking less about Anne's quaint speeches\nthan of her fresh enthusiasms, her transparent emotions, her little\nwinning ways, and the sweetness of her eyes and lips.\n\"I thought Marilla Cuthbert was an old fool when I heard she'd adopted\na girl out of an orphan asylum,\" she said to herself, \"but I guess she\ndidn't make much of a mistake after all. If I'd a child like Anne in the\nhouse all the time I'd be a better and happier woman.\"\nAnne and Diana found the drive home as pleasant as the drive\nin--pleasanter, indeed, since there was the delightful consciousness of\nhome waiting at the end of it. It was sunset when they passed through\nWhite Sands and turned into the shore road. Beyond, the Avonlea hills\ncame out darkly against the saffron sky. Behind them the moon was rising\nout of the sea that grew all radiant and transfigured in her light.\nEvery little cove along the curving road was a marvel of dancing\nripples. The waves broke with a soft swish on the rocks below them, and\nthe tang of the sea was in the strong, fresh air.\n\"Oh, but it's good to be alive and to be going home,\" breathed Anne.\nWhen she crossed the log bridge over the brook the kitchen light of\nGreen Gables winked her a friendly welcome back, and through the open\ndoor shone the hearth fire, sending out its warm red glow athwart the\nchilly autumn night. Anne ran blithely up the hill and into the kitchen,\nwhere a hot supper was waiting on the table.\n\"So you've got back?\" said Marilla, folding up her knitting.\n\"Yes, and oh, it's so good to be back,\" said Anne joyously. \"I could\nkiss everything, even to the clock. Marilla, a broiled chicken! You\ndon't mean to say you cooked that for me!\"\n\"Yes, I did,\" said Marilla. \"I thought you'd be hungry after such\na drive and need something real appetizing. Hurry and take off your\nthings, and we'll have supper as soon as Matthew comes in. I'm glad\nyou've got back, I must say. It's been fearful lonesome here without\nyou, and I never put in four longer days.\"\nAfter supper Anne sat before the fire between Matthew and Marilla, and\ngave them a full account of her visit.\n\"I've had a splendid time,\" she concluded happily, \"and I feel that it\nmarks an epoch in my life. But the best of it all was the coming home.\"",

Her\neyes were tired, and she thought vaguely that she must see about having\nher glasses changed the next time she went to town, for her eyes had\ngrown tired very often of late.\nIt was nearly dark, for the full November twilight had fallen around\nGreen Gables, and the only light in the kitchen came from the dancing\nred flames in the stove.\nAnne was curled up Turk-fashion on the hearthrug, gazing into that\njoyous glow where the sunshine of a hundred summers was being distilled\nfrom the maple cordwood. She had been reading, but her book had slipped\nto the floor, and now she was dreaming, with a smile on her parted lips.\nGlittering castles in Spain were shaping themselves out of the mists and\nrainbows of her lively fancy; adventures wonderful and enthralling\nwere happening to her in cloudland--adventures that always turned out\ntriumphantly and never involved her in scrapes like those of actual\nlife.\nMarilla looked at her with a tenderness that would never have been\nsuffered to reveal itself in any clearer light than that soft mingling\nof fireshine and shadow. The lesson of a love that should display itself\neasily in spoken word and open look was one Marilla could never learn.\nBut she had learned to love this slim, gray-eyed girl with an affection\nall the deeper and stronger from its very undemonstrativeness. Her love\nmade her afraid of being unduly indulgent, indeed. She had an uneasy\nfeeling that it was rather sinful to set one's heart so intensely on any\nhuman creature as she had set hers on Anne, and perhaps she performed a\nsort of unconscious penance for this by being stricter and more critical\nthan if the girl had been less dear to her. Certainly Anne herself had\nno idea how Marilla loved her. She sometimes thought wistfully that\nMarilla was very hard to please and distinctly lacking in sympathy\nand understanding. But she always checked the thought reproachfully,\nremembering what she owed to Marilla.",

Oh, I'm so sorry I wasn't in. Why didn't you call me, Marilla?\nDiana and I were only over in the Haunted Wood. It's lovely in the woods\nnow. All the little wood things--the ferns and the satin leaves and the\ncrackerberries--have gone to sleep, just as if somebody had tucked them\naway until spring under a blanket of leaves. I think it was a little\ngray fairy with a rainbow scarf that came tiptoeing along the last\nmoonlight night and did it. Diana wouldn't say much about that, though.\nDiana has never forgotten the scolding her mother gave her about\nimagining ghosts into the Haunted Wood. It had a very bad effect on\nDiana's imagination. It blighted it. Mrs. Lynde says Myrtle Bell is a\nblighted being. I asked Ruby Gillis why Myrtle was blighted, and Ruby\nsaid she guessed it was because her young man had gone back on her. Ruby\nGillis thinks of nothing but young men, and the older she gets the worse\nshe is. Young men are all very well in their place, but it doesn't do to\ndrag them into everything, does it? Diana and I are thinking seriously\nof promising each other that we will never marry but be nice old maids\nand live together forever. Diana hasn't quite made up her mind though,\nbecause she thinks perhaps it would be nobler to marry some wild,\ndashing, wicked young man and reform him. Diana and I talk a great deal\nabout serious subjects now, you know. We feel that we are so much older\nthan we used to be that it isn't becoming to talk of childish matters.\nIt's such a solemn thing to be almost fourteen, Marilla. Miss Stacy took\nall us girls who are in our teens down to the brook last Wednesday, and\ntalked to us about it. She said we couldn't be too careful what habits\nwe formed and what ideals we acquired in our teens, because by the time\nwe were twenty our characters would be developed and the foundation laid\nfor our whole future life. And she said if the foundation was shaky we\ncould never build anything really worth while on it. Diana and I talked\nthe matter over coming home from school. We felt extremely solemn,\nMarilla. And we decided that we would try to be very careful indeed and\nform respectable habits and learn all we could and be as sensible as\npossible, so that by the time we were twenty our characters would be\nproperly developed. It's perfectly appalling to think of being twenty,\nMarilla. It sounds so fearfully old and grown up. But why was Miss Stacy\nhere this afternoon?\"",

I can't tell you how ashamed I felt, Marilla,\nespecially when I heard Josie Pye giggling. Miss Stacy took Ben Hur\naway, but she never said a word then. She kept me in at recess and\ntalked to me. She said I had done very wrong in two respects. First, I\nwas wasting the time I ought to have put on my studies; and secondly,\nI was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear I was reading a\nhistory when it was a storybook instead. I had never realized until that\nmoment, Marilla, that what I was doing was deceitful. I was shocked. I\ncried bitterly, and asked Miss Stacy to forgive me and I'd never do such\na thing again; and I offered to do penance by never so much as looking\nat Ben Hur for a whole week, not even to see how the chariot race turned\nout.

Never, since the night on which Minnie May had had the\ncroup, had she and Diana been separated in anything. On the evening when\nthe Queen's class first remained in school for the extra lessons and\nAnne saw Diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through\nthe Birch Path and Violet Vale, it was all the former could do to keep\nher seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. A lump\ncame into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her\nuplifted Latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. Not for worlds\nwould Anne have had Gilbert Blythe or Josie Pye see those tears.\n\"But, oh, Marilla, I really felt that I had tasted the bitterness of\ndeath, as Mr. Allan said in his sermon last Sunday, when I saw Diana go\nout alone,\" she said mournfully that night. \"I thought how splendid it\nwould have been if Diana had only been going to study for the Entrance,\ntoo. But we can't have things perfect in this imperfect world, as Mrs.\nLynde says. Mrs. Lynde isn't exactly a comforting person sometimes, but\nthere's no doubt she says a great many very true things. And I think the\nQueen's class is going to be extremely interesting. Jane and Ruby\nare just going to study to be teachers. That is the height of their\nambition. Ruby says she will only teach for two years after she gets\nthrough, and then she intends to be married. Jane says she will devote\nher whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid\na salary for teaching, but a husband won't pay you anything, and growls\nif you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. I expect Jane speaks\nfrom mournful experience, for Mrs. Lynde says that her father is a\nperfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. Josie Pye says she\nis just going to college for education's sake, because she won't have to\nearn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who\nare living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. Moody Spurgeon is going to\nbe a minister. Mrs. Lynde says he couldn't be anything else with a name\nlike that to live up to. I hope it isn't wicked of me, Marilla, but\nreally the thought of Moody Spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.\nHe's such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little\nblue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. But perhaps he will\nbe more intellectual looking when he grows up. Charlie Sloane says he's\ngoing to go into politics and be a member of Parliament, but Mrs. Lynde\nsays he'll never succeed at that, because the Sloanes are all honest\npeople, and it's only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.\"",

He\ntalked and jested with the other girls, exchanged books and puzzles with\nthem, discussed lessons and plans, sometimes walked home with one or the\nother of them from prayer meeting or Debating Club. But Anne Shirley\nhe simply ignored, and Anne found out that it is not pleasant to be\nignored. It was in vain that she told herself with a toss of her head\nthat she did not care. Deep down in her wayward, feminine little heart\nshe knew that she did care, and that if she had that chance of the Lake\nof Shining Waters again she would answer very differently.

It was in vain that she recalled every\nincident and emotion of that memorable occasion and tried to feel\nthe old satisfying anger. That day by the pond had witnessed its last\nspasmodic flicker. Anne realized that she had forgiven and forgotten\nwithout knowing it. But it was too late.\nAnd at least neither Gilbert nor anybody else, not even Diana, should\never suspect how sorry she was and how much she wished she hadn't been\nso proud and horrid! She determined to \"shroud her feelings in deepest\noblivion,\" and it may be stated here and now that she did it, so\nsuccessfully that Gilbert, who possibly was not quite so indifferent as\nhe seemed, could not console himself with any belief that Anne felt his\nretaliatory scorn.

Oh, yes, he's all right again now,\nbut he takes them spells oftener than he used to and I'm anxious about\nhim. The doctor says he must be careful to avoid excitement. That's easy\nenough, for Matthew doesn't go about looking for excitement by any means\nand never did, but he's not to do any very heavy work either and you\nmight as well tell Matthew not to breathe as not to work. Come and lay\noff your things, Rachel. You'll stay to tea?\"\n\"Well, seeing you're so pressing, perhaps I might as well, stay\" said\nMrs. Rachel, who had not the slightest intention of doing anything else.\nMrs. Rachel and Marilla sat comfortably in the parlor while Anne got the\ntea and made hot biscuits that were light and white enough to defy even\nMrs. Rachel's criticism.\n\"I must say Anne has turned out a real smart girl,\" admitted Mrs.\nRachel, as Marilla accompanied her to the end of the lane at sunset.\n\"She must be a great help to you.\"\n\"She is,\" said Marilla, \"and she's real steady and reliable now. I used\nto be afraid she'd never get over her featherbrained ways, but she has\nand I wouldn't be afraid to trust her in anything now.\"\n\"I never would have thought she'd have turned out so well that first day\nI was here three years ago,\" said Mrs. Rachel. \"Lawful heart, shall I\never forget that tantrum of hers! When I went home that night I says to\nThomas, says I, 'Mark my words, Thomas, Marilla Cuthbert 'll live to\nrue the step she's took.' But I was mistaken and I'm real glad of it. I\nain't one of those kind of people, Marilla, as can never be brought to\nown up that they've made a mistake. No, that never was my way, thank\ngoodness. I did make a mistake in judging Anne, but it weren't no\nwonder, for an odder, unexpecteder witch of a child there never was in\nthis world, that's what. There was no ciphering her out by the rules\nthat worked with other children. It's nothing short of wonderful how\nshe's improved these three years, but especially in looks. She's a real\npretty girl got to be, though I can't say I'm overly partial to that\npale, big-eyed style myself. I like more snap and color, like Diana\nBarry has or Ruby Gillis. Ruby Gillis's looks are real showy. But\nsomehow--I don't know how it is but when Anne and them are together,\nthough she ain't half as handsome, she makes them look kind of common\nand overdone--something like them white June lilies she calls narcissus",

I've\nhad a perfectly beautiful summer, Marilla, and now I'm rejoicing as a\nstrong man to run a race, as Mr. Allan said last Sunday. Doesn't Mr.\nAllan preach magnificent sermons? Mrs. Lynde says he is improving every\nday and the first thing we know some city church will gobble him up\nand then we'll be left and have to turn to and break in another green\npreacher. But I don't see the use of meeting trouble halfway, do you,\nMarilla? I think it would be better just to enjoy Mr. Allan while we\nhave him. If I were a man I think I'd be a minister. They can have\nsuch an influence for good, if their theology is sound; and it must be\nthrilling to preach splendid sermons and stir your hearers' hearts. Why\ncan't women be ministers, Marilla? I asked Mrs. Lynde that and she was\nshocked and said it would be a scandalous thing. She said there might\nbe female ministers in the States and she believed there was, but thank\ngoodness we hadn't got to that stage in Canada yet and she hoped we\nnever would. But I don't see why. I think women would make splendid\nministers. When there is a social to be got up or a church tea or\nanything else to raise money the women have to turn to and do the work.\nI'm sure Mrs. Lynde can pray every bit as well as Superintendent Bell\nand I've no doubt she could preach too with a little practice.\"\n\"Yes, I believe she could,\" said Marilla dryly. \"She does plenty of\nunofficial preaching as it is. Nobody has much of a chance to go wrong\nin Avonlea with Rachel to oversee them.\"\n\"Marilla,\" said Anne in a burst of confidence, \"I want to tell you\nsomething and ask you what you think about it. It has worried me\nterribly--on Sunday afternoons, that is, when I think specially about\nsuch matters. I do really want to be good; and when I'm with you or Mrs.\nAllan or Miss Stacy I want it more than ever and I want to do just what\nwould please you and what you would approve of. But mostly when I'm with\nMrs. Lynde I feel desperately wicked and as if I wanted to go and do the\nvery thing she tells me I oughtn't to do. I feel irresistibly tempted\nto do it. Now, what do you think is the reason I feel like that? Do you\nthink it's because I'm really bad and unregenerate?\"\nMarilla looked dubious for a moment. Then she laughed.\n\"If you are I guess I am too, Anne, for Rachel often has that very\neffect on me. I sometimes think she'd have more of an influence for\ngood, as you say yourself, if she didn't keep nagging people to do\nright. There should have been a special commandment against nagging.\nBut there, I shouldn't talk so. Rachel is a good Christian woman and she\nmeans well. There isn't a kinder soul in Avonlea and she never shirks\nher share of work.\"\n\"I'm very glad you feel the same,\" said Anne decidedly. \"It's so\nencouraging. I shan't worry so much over that after this. But I dare say\nthere'll be other things to worry me. They keep coming up new all the\ntime--things to perplex you, you know. You settle one question and\nthere's another right after. There are so many things to be thought over\nand decided when you're beginning to grow up. It keeps me busy all the\ntime thinking them over and deciding what is right. It's a serious thing\nto grow up, isn't it, Marilla? But when I have such good friends as\nyou and Matthew and Mrs. Allan and Miss Stacy I ought to grow up\nsuccessfully, and I'm sure it will be my own fault if I don't. I feel\nit's a great responsibility because I have only the one chance. If I\ndon't grow up right I can't go back and begin over again. I've grown two\ninches this summer, Marilla. Mr. Gillis measured me at Ruby's party. I'm\nso glad you made my new dresses longer. That dark-green one is so pretty\nand it was sweet of you to put on the flounce. Of course I know it\nwasn't really necessary, but flounces are so stylish this fall and Josie\nPye has flounces on all her dresses. I know I'll be able to study better\nbecause of mine. I shall have such a comfortable feeling deep down in my\nmind about that flounce.\"",

A sigh\nfollowed on the words. Marilla felt a queer regret over Anne's inches.\nThe child she had learned to love had vanished somehow and here was this\ntall, serious-eyed girl of fifteen, with the thoughtful brows and the\nproudly poised little head, in her place. Marilla loved the girl as much\nas she had loved the child, but she was conscious of a queer sorrowful\nsense of loss. And that night, when Anne had gone to prayer meeting\nwith Diana, Marilla sat alone in the wintry twilight and indulged in the\nweakness of a cry. Matthew, coming in with a lantern, caught her at it\nand gazed at her in such consternation that Marilla had to laugh through\nher tears.\n\"I was thinking about Anne,\" she explained. \"She's got to be such a big\ngirl--and she'll probably be away from us next winter. I'll miss her\nterrible.\"\n\"She'll be able to come home often,\" comforted Matthew, to whom Anne was\nas yet and always would be the little, eager girl he had brought home\nfrom Bright River on that June evening four years before. \"The branch\nrailroad will be built to Carmody by that time.\"\n\"It won't be the same thing as having her here all the time,\" sighed\nMarilla gloomily, determined to enjoy her luxury of grief uncomforted.\n\"But there--men can't understand these things!\"",

Perhaps she thought all the\nmore and dreamed as much as ever, but she certainly talked less. Marilla\nnoticed and commented on this also.\n\"You don't chatter half as much as you used to, Anne, nor use half as\nmany big words. What has come over you?\"\nAnne colored and laughed a little, as she dropped her book and looked\ndreamily out of the window, where big fat red buds were bursting out on\nthe creeper in response to the lure of the spring sunshine.\n\"I don't know--I don't want to talk as much,\" she said, denting her\nchin thoughtfully with her forefinger. \"It's nicer to think dear, pretty\nthoughts and keep them in one's heart, like treasures. I don't like to\nhave them laughed at or wondered over. And somehow I don't want to use\nbig words any more. It's almost a pity, isn't it, now that I'm really\ngrowing big enough to say them if I did want to. It's fun to be almost\ngrown up in some ways, but it's not the kind of fun I expected, Marilla.\nThere's so much to learn and do and think that there isn't time for big\nwords. Besides, Miss Stacy says the short ones are much stronger and\nbetter. She makes us write all our essays as simply as possible. It was\nhard at first. I was so used to crowding in all the fine big words I\ncould think of--and I thought of any number of them. But I've got used\nto it now and I see it's so much better.\"\n\"What has become of your story club? I haven't heard you speak of it for\na long time.\"\n\"The story club isn't in existence any longer. We hadn't time for\nit--and anyhow I think we had got tired of it. It was silly to be\nwriting about love and murder and elopements and mysteries. Miss Stacy\nsometimes has us write a story for training in composition, but she\nwon't let us write anything but what might happen in Avonlea in our own\nlives, and she criticizes it very sharply and makes us criticize our own\ntoo. I never thought my compositions had so many faults until I began to\nlook for them myself. I felt so ashamed I wanted to give up altogether,\nbut Miss Stacy said I could learn to write well if I only trained myself\nto be my own severest critic. And so I am trying to.\"\n\"You've only two more months before the Entrance,\" said Marilla. \"Do you\nthink you'll be able to get through?\"\nAnne shivered.\n\"I don't know. Sometimes I think I'll be all right--and then I get\nhorribly afraid. We've studied hard and Miss Stacy has drilled us\nthoroughly, but we mayn't get through for all that. We've each got a\nstumbling block. Mine is geometry of course, and Jane's is Latin, and\nRuby and Charlie's is algebra, and Josie's is arithmetic. Moody Spurgeon\nsays he feels it in his bones that he is going to fail in English\nhistory. Miss Stacy is going to give us examinations in June just as\nhard as we'll have at the Entrance and mark us just as strictly, so\nwe'll have some idea. I wish it was all over, Marilla. It haunts me.\nSometimes I wake up in the night and wonder what I'll do if I don't\npass.\"\n\"Why, go to school next year and try again,\" said Marilla unconcernedly.\n\"Oh, I don't believe I'd have the heart for it. It would be such a\ndisgrace to fail, especially if Gil--if the others passed. And I get so\nnervous in an examination that I'm likely to make a mess of it. I wish I\nhad nerves like Jane Andrews. Nothing rattles her.\"\nAnne sighed and, dragging her eyes from the witcheries of the spring\nworld, the beckoning day of breeze and blue, and the green things\nupspringing in the garden, buried herself resolutely in her book.\nThere would be other springs, but if she did not succeed in passing the\nEntrance, Anne felt convinced that she would never recover sufficiently\nto enjoy them.",

Red eyes and damp handkerchiefs bore\nconvincing testimony to the fact that Miss Stacy's farewell words must\nhave been quite as touching as Mr. Phillips's had been under similar\ncircumstances three years before. Diana looked back at the schoolhouse\nfrom the foot of the spruce hill and sighed deeply.\n\"It does seem as if it was the end of everything, doesn't it?\" she said\ndismally.\n\"You oughtn't to feel half as badly as I do,\" said Anne, hunting vainly\nfor a dry spot on her handkerchief. \"You'll be back again next winter,\nbut I suppose I've left the dear old school forever--if I have good\nluck, that is.\"\n\"It won't be a bit the same. Miss Stacy won't be there, nor you nor Jane\nnor Ruby probably. I shall have to sit all alone, for I couldn't bear\nto have another deskmate after you. Oh, we have had jolly times, haven't\nwe, Anne? It's dreadful to think they're all over.\"\nTwo big tears rolled down by Diana's nose.\n\"If you would stop crying I could,\" said Anne imploringly. \"Just as\nsoon as I put away my hanky I see you brimming up and that starts me off\nagain. As Mrs. Lynde says, 'If you can't be cheerful, be as cheerful as\nyou can.' After all, I dare say I'll be back next year. This is one\nof the times I _know_ I'm not going to pass. They're getting alarmingly\nfrequent.\"\n\"Why, you came out splendidly in the exams Miss Stacy gave.\"\n\"Yes, but those exams didn't make me nervous. When I think of the real\nthing you can't imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round\nmy heart. And then my number is thirteen and Josie Pye says it's so\nunlucky. I am _not_ superstitious and I know it can make no difference.\nBut still I wish it wasn't thirteen.\"\n\"I do wish I was going in with you,\" said Diana. \"Wouldn't we have\na perfectly elegant time? But I suppose you'll have to cram in the\nevenings.\"\n\"No; Miss Stacy has made us promise not to open a book at all. She says\nit would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not\nthink about the exams at all and go to bed early. It's good advice, but\nI expect it will be hard to follow; good advice is apt to be, I think.\nPrissy Andrews told me that she sat up half the night every night of her\nEntrance week and crammed for dear life; and I had determined to sit up\n_at least_ as long as she did. It was so kind of your Aunt Josephine to\nask me to stay at Beechwood while I'm in town.\"\n\"You'll write to me while you're in, won't you?\"\n\"I'll write Tuesday night and tell you how the first day goes,\" promised\nAnne.\n\"I'll be haunting the post office Wednesday,\" vowed Diana.",

Last night I was horribly lonesome all alone in my room and\nwished so much you were with me. I couldn't 'cram' because I'd promised\nMiss Stacy not to, but it was as hard to keep from opening my history\nas it used to be to keep from reading a story before my lessons were\nlearned.\n\"This morning Miss Stacy came for me and we went to the Academy, calling\nfor Jane and Ruby and Josie on our way. Ruby asked me to feel her hands\nand they were as cold as ice. Josie said I looked as if I hadn't slept\na wink and she didn't believe I was strong enough to stand the grind\nof the teacher's course even if I did get through. There are times and\nseasons even yet when I don't feel that I've made any great headway in\nlearning to like Josie Pye!\n\"When we reached the Academy there were scores of students there from\nall over the Island. The first person we saw was Moody Spurgeon sitting\non the steps and muttering away to himself. Jane asked him what on earth\nhe was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over\nand over to steady his nerves and for pity's sake not to interrupt\nhim, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot\neverything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his facts\nfirmly in their proper place!\n\"When we were assigned to our rooms Miss Stacy had to leave us. Jane and\nI sat together and Jane was so composed that I envied her. No need of\nthe multiplication table for good, steady, sensible Jane! I wondered if\nI looked as I felt and if they could hear my heart thumping clear\nacross the room. Then a man came in and began distributing the English\nexamination sheets. My hands grew cold then and my head fairly whirled\naround as I picked it up. Just one awful moment--Diana, I felt exactly\nas I did four years ago when I asked Marilla if I might stay at Green\nGables--and then everything cleared up in my mind and my heart began\nbeating again--I forgot to say that it had stopped altogether!--for I\nknew I could do something with _that_ paper anyhow.\n\"At noon we went home for dinner and then back again for history in\nthe afternoon. The history was a pretty hard paper and I got dreadfully\nmixed up in the dates. Still, I think I did fairly well today. But oh,\nDiana, tomorrow the geometry exam comes off and when I think of it\nit takes every bit of determination I possess to keep from opening my\nEuclid. If I thought the multiplication table would help me any I would\nrecite it from now till tomorrow morning.\n\"I went down to see the other girls this evening. On my way I met Moody\nSpurgeon wandering distractedly around. He said he knew he had failed in\nhistory and he was born to be a disappointment to his parents and he\nwas going home on the morning train; and it would be easier to be a\ncarpenter than a minister, anyhow. I cheered him up and persuaded him to\nstay to the end because it would be unfair to Miss Stacy if he didn't.\nSometimes I have wished I was born a boy, but when I see Moody Spurgeon\nI'm always glad I'm a girl and not his sister.\n\"Ruby was in hysterics when I reached their boardinghouse; she had just\ndiscovered a fearful mistake she had made in her English paper. When\nshe recovered we went uptown and had an ice cream. How we wished you had\nbeen with us.\n\"Oh, Diana, if only the geometry examination were over! But there, as\nMrs. Lynde would say, the sun will go on rising and setting whether I\nfail in geometry or not. That is true but not especially comforting. I\nthink I'd rather it didn't go on if I failed!\n\"Yours devotedly,\n\"Anne\"",

She knew\nthat all Avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she\neven knew that Jimmy Glover and Ned Wright had a bet on the question\nand that Josie Pye had said there was no doubt in the world that Gilbert\nwould be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if\nshe failed.\nBut she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. She wanted\nto \"pass high\" for the sake of Matthew and Marilla--especially Matthew.\nMatthew had declared to her his conviction that she \"would beat the\nwhole Island.\" That, Anne felt, was something it would be foolish to\nhope for even in the wildest dreams. But she did hope fervently that she\nwould be among the first ten at least, so that she might see Matthew's\nkindly brown eyes gleam with pride in her achievement. That, she\nfelt, would be a sweet reward indeed for all her hard work and patient\ngrubbing among unimaginative equations and conjugations.\nAt the end of the fortnight Anne took to \"haunting\" the post office\nalso, in the distracted company of Jane, Ruby, and Josie, opening the\nCharlottetown dailies with shaking hands and cold, sinkaway feelings\nas bad as any experienced during the Entrance week. Charlie and Gilbert\nwere not above doing this too, but Moody Spurgeon stayed resolutely\naway.\n\"I haven't got the grit to go there and look at a paper in cold blood,\"\nhe told Anne. \"I'm just going to wait until somebody comes and tells me\nsuddenly whether I've passed or not.\"",

            "text": "When three weeks had gone by without the pass list appearing Anne began\nto feel that she really couldn't stand the strain much longer. Her\nappetite failed and her interest in Avonlea doings languished.\nMrs. Lynde wanted to know what else you could expect with a Tory\nsuperintendent of education at the head of affairs, and Matthew, noting\nAnne's paleness and indifference and the lagging steps that bore her\nhome from the post office every afternoon, began seriously to wonder if\nhe hadn't better vote Grit at the next election.\nBut one evening the news came. Anne was sitting at her open window,\nfor the time forgetful of the woes of examinations and the cares of the\nworld, as she drank in the beauty of the summer dusk, sweet-scented with\nflower breaths from the garden below and sibilant and rustling from the\nstir of poplars. The eastern sky above the firs was flushed faintly pink\nfrom the reflection of the west, and Anne was wondering dreamily if the\nspirit of color looked like that, when she saw Diana come flying\ndown through the firs, over the log bridge, and up the slope, with a\nfluttering newspaper in her hand.\nAnne sprang to her feet, knowing at once what that paper contained. The\npass list was out! Her head whirled and her heart beat until it hurt\nher. She could not move a step. It seemed an hour to her before Diana\ncame rushing along the hall and burst into the room without even\nknocking, so great was her excitement.\n\"Anne, you've passed,\" she cried, \"passed the _very first_--you and\nGilbert both--you're ties--but your name is first. Oh, I'm so proud!\"\nDiana flung the paper on the table and herself on Anne's bed, utterly\nbreathless and incapable of further speech. Anne lighted the lamp,\noversetting the match safe and using up half a dozen matches before her\nshaking hands could accomplish the task. Then she snatched up the paper.\nYes, she had passed--there was her name at the very top of a list of two\nhundred! That moment was worth living for.\n\"You did just splendidly, Anne,\" puffed Diana, recovering sufficiently\nto sit up and speak, for Anne, starry eyed and rapt, had not uttered a\nword. \"Father brought the paper home from Bright River not ten minutes\nago--it came out on the afternoon train, you know, and won't be here\ntill tomorrow by mail--and when I saw the pass list I just rushed over\nlike a wild thing. You've all passed, every one of you, Moody Spurgeon\nand all, although he's conditioned in history. Jane and Ruby did pretty\nwell--they're halfway up--and so did Charlie. Josie just scraped through\nwith three marks to spare, but you'll see she'll put on as many airs as\nif she'd led. Won't Miss Stacy be delighted? Oh, Anne, what does it feel\nlike to see your name at the head of a pass list like that? If it were\nme I know I'd go crazy with joy. I am pretty near crazy as it is, but\nyou're as calm and cool as a spring evening.\"\n\"I'm just dazzled inside,\" said Anne. \"I want to say a hundred things,\nand I can't find words to say them in. I never dreamed of this--yes, I\ndid too, just once! I let myself think _once_, 'What if I should come out\nfirst?' quakingly, you know, for it seemed so vain and presumptuous to\nthink I could lead the Island. Excuse me a minute, Diana. I must run\nright out to the field to tell Matthew. Then we'll go up the road and\ntell the good news to the others.\"\nThey hurried to the hayfield below the barn where Matthew was coiling\nhay, and, as luck would have it, Mrs. Lynde was talking to Marilla at\nthe lane fence.\n\"Oh, Matthew,\" exclaimed Anne, \"I've passed and I'm first--or one of the\nfirst! I'm not vain, but I'm thankful.\"\n\"Well now, I always said it,\" said Matthew, gazing at the pass list\ndelightedly. \"I knew you could beat them all easy.\"\n\"You've done pretty well, I must say, Anne,\" said Marilla, trying to\nhide her extreme pride in Anne from Mrs. Rachel's critical eye. But that\ngood soul said heartily:\n\"I just guess she has done well, and far be it from me to be backward in\nsaying it. You're a credit to your friends, Anne, that's what, and we're\nall proud of you.\"\nThat night Anne, who had wound up the delightful evening with a serious\nlittle talk with Mrs. Allan at the manse, knelt sweetly by her open\nwindow in a great sheen of moonshine and murmured a prayer of gratitude\nand aspiration that came straight from her heart. There was in it\nthankfulness for the past and reverent petition for the future; and when\nshe slept on her white pillow her dreams were as fair and bright and\nbeautiful as maidenhood might desire.",

A big round moon, slowly deepening from her pallid luster into\nburnished silver, hung over the Haunted Wood; the air was full of sweet\nsummer sounds--sleepy birds twittering, freakish breezes, faraway\nvoices and laughter. But in Anne's room the blind was drawn and the lamp\nlighted, for an important toilet was being made.\nThe east gable was a very different place from what it had been on that\nnight four years before, when Anne had felt its bareness penetrate to\nthe marrow of her spirit with its inhospitable chill. Changes had crept\nin, Marilla conniving at them resignedly, until it was as sweet and\ndainty a nest as a young girl could desire.\nThe velvet carpet with the pink roses and the pink silk curtains of\nAnne's early visions had certainly never materialized; but her dreams\nhad kept pace with her growth, and it is not probable she lamented\nthem. The floor was covered with a pretty matting, and the curtains that\nsoftened the high window and fluttered in the vagrant breezes were of\npale-green art muslin. The walls, hung not with gold and silver brocade\ntapestry, but with a dainty apple-blossom paper, were adorned with a few\ngood pictures given Anne by Mrs. Allan. Miss Stacy's photograph occupied\nthe place of honor, and Anne made a sentimental point of keeping fresh\nflowers on the bracket under it. Tonight a spike of white lilies faintly\nperfumed the room like the dream of a fragrance. There was no \"mahogany\nfurniture,\" but there was a white-painted bookcase filled with books, a\ncushioned wicker rocker, a toilet table befrilled with white muslin,\na quaint, gilt-framed mirror with chubby pink Cupids and purple grapes\npainted over its arched top, that used to hang in the spare room, and a\nlow white bed.\nAnne was dressing for a concert at the White Sands Hotel. The guests had\ngot it up in aid of the Charlottetown hospital, and had hunted out all\nthe available amateur talent in the surrounding districts to help it\nalong. Bertha Sampson and Pearl Clay of the White Sands Baptist choir\nhad been asked to sing a duet; Milton Clark of Newbridge was to give a\nviolin solo; Winnie Adella Blair of Carmody was to sing a Scotch ballad;\nand Laura Spencer of Spencervale and Anne Shirley of Avonlea were to\nrecite.\nAs Anne would have said at one time, it was \"an epoch in her life,\" and\nshe was deliciously athrill with the excitement of it. Matthew was in\nthe seventh heaven of gratified pride over the honor conferred on his\nAnne and Marilla was not far behind, although she would have died rather\nthan admit it, and said she didn't think it was very proper for a lot\nof young folks to be gadding over to the hotel without any responsible\nperson with them.\nAnne and Diana were to drive over with Jane Andrews and her brother\nBilly in their double-seated buggy; and several other Avonlea girls and\nboys were going too. There was a party of visitors expected out from\ntown, and after the concert a supper was to be given to the performers.\n\"Do you really think the organdy will be best?\" queried Anne anxiously.\n\"I don't think it's as pretty as my blue-flowered muslin--and it\ncertainly isn't so fashionable.\"\n\"But it suits you ever so much better,\" said Diana. \"It's so soft\nand frilly and clinging. The muslin is stiff, and makes you look too\ndressed up. But the organdy seems as if it grew on you.\"\nAnne sighed and yielded. Diana was beginning to have a reputation for\nnotable taste in dressing, and her advice on such subjects was much\nsought after. She was looking very pretty herself on this particular\nnight in a dress of the lovely wild-rose pink, from which Anne was\nforever debarred; but she was not to take any part in the concert, so\nher appearance was of minor importance. All her pains were bestowed upon\nAnne, who, she vowed, must, for the credit of Avonlea, be dressed and\ncombed and adorned to the Queen's taste.\n\"Pull out that frill a little more--so; here, let me tie your sash; now\nfor your slippers. I'm going to braid your hair in two thick braids,\nand tie them halfway up with big white bows--no, don't pull out a single\ncurl over your forehead--just have the soft part. There is no way you do\nyour hair suits you so well, Anne, and Mrs. Allan says you look like a\nMadonna when you part it so. I shall fasten this little white house rose\njust behind your ear. There was just one on my bush, and I saved it for\nyou.\"\n\"Shall I put my pearl beads on?\" asked Anne. \"Matthew brought me a\nstring from town last week, and I know he'd like to see them on me.\"\nDiana pursed up her lips, put her black head on one side critically,\nand finally pronounced in favor of the beads, which were thereupon tied\naround Anne's slim milk-white throat.\n\"There's something so stylish about you, Anne,\" said Diana, with\nunenvious admiration. \"You hold your head with such an air. I suppose\nit's your figure. I am just a dumpling. I've always been afraid of it,\nand now I know it is so. Well, I suppose I shall just have to resign\nmyself to it.\"\n\"But you have such dimples,\" said Anne, smiling affectionately into the\npretty, vivacious face so near her own. \"Lovely dimples, like little\ndents in cream. I have given up all hope of dimples. My dimple-dream\nwill never come true; but so many of my dreams have that I mustn't\ncomplain. Am I all ready now?\"\n\"All ready,\" assured Diana, as Marilla appeared in the doorway, a gaunt\nfigure with grayer hair than of yore and no fewer angles, but with a\nmuch softer face. \"Come right in and look at our elocutionist, Marilla.\nDoesn't she look lovely?\"\nMarilla emitted a sound between a sniff and a grunt.\n\"She looks neat and proper. I like that way of fixing her hair. But I\nexpect she'll ruin that dress driving over there in the dust and dew\nwith it, and it looks most too thin for these damp nights. Organdy's the\nmost unserviceable stuff in the world anyhow, and I told Matthew so when\nhe got it. But there is no use in saying anything to Matthew nowadays.\nTime was when he would take my advice, but now he just buys things for\nAnne regardless, and the clerks at Carmody know they can palm anything\noff on him. Just let them tell him a thing is pretty and fashionable,\nand Matthew plunks his money down for it. Mind you keep your skirt clear\nof the wheel, Anne, and put your warm jacket on.\"\nThen Marilla stalked downstairs, thinking proudly how sweet Anne looked,\nwith that\n\"One moonbeam from the forehead to the crown\"\nand regretting that she could not go to the concert herself to hear her\ngirl recite.\n\"I wonder if it _is_ too damp for my dress,\" said Anne anxiously.\n\"Not a bit of it,\" said Diana, pulling up the window blind. \"It's a\nperfect night, and there won't be any dew. Look at the moonlight.\"\n\"I'm so glad my window looks east into the sun rising,\" said Anne, going\nover to Diana. \"It's so splendid to see the morning coming up over those\nlong hills and glowing through those sharp fir tops. It's new every\nmorning, and I feel as if I washed my very soul in that bath of earliest\nsunshine. Oh, Diana, I love this little room so dearly. I don't know how\nI'll get along without it when I go to town next month.\"",

Somehow Anne--who did\nnot notice the rather guilty little start of surprise the white-lace\ngirl gave, and would not have understood the subtle compliment implied\ntherein if she had--got on her feet, and moved dizzily out to the front.\nShe was so pale that Diana and Jane, down in the audience, clasped each\nother's hands in nervous sympathy.\nAnne was the victim of an overwhelming attack of stage fright. Often as\nshe had recited in public, she had never before faced such an audience\nas this, and the sight of it paralyzed her energies completely.\nEverything was so strange, so brilliant, so bewildering--the rows of\nladies in evening dress, the critical faces, the whole atmosphere of\nwealth and culture about her. Very different this from the plain benches\nat the Debating Club, filled with the homely, sympathetic faces of\nfriends and neighbors. These people, she thought, would be merciless\ncritics. Perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement\nfrom her \"rustic\" efforts. She felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and\nmiserable. Her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness\ncame over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would\nhave fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,\nmust ever after be her portion if she did so.\nBut suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the\naudience, she saw Gilbert Blythe away at the back of the room, bending\nforward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to Anne at once\ntriumphant and taunting. In reality it was nothing of the kind. Gilbert\nwas merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and\nof the effect produced by Anne's slender white form and spiritual face\nagainst a background of palms in particular. Josie Pye, whom he had\ndriven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant\nand taunting. But Anne did not see Josie, and would not have cared if\nshe had. She drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage\nand determination tingling over her like an electric shock. She _would\nnot_ fail before Gilbert Blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,\nnever, never! Her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her\nrecitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of\nthe room without a tremor or a break. Self-possession was fully restored\nto her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness\nshe recited as she had never done before. When she finished there were\nbursts of honest applause. Anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing\nwith shyness and delight, found her hand vigorously clasped and shaken\nby the stout lady in pink silk.\n\"My dear, you did splendidly,\" she puffed. \"I've been crying like a\nbaby, actually I have. There, they're encoring you--they're bound to\nhave you back!\"\n\"Oh, I can't go,\" said Anne confusedly. \"But yet--I must, or Matthew\nwill be disappointed. He said they would encore me.\"\n\"Then don't disappoint Matthew,\" said the pink lady, laughing.\nSmiling, blushing, limpid eyed, Anne tripped back and gave a quaint,\nfunny little selection that captivated her audience still further. The\nrest of the evening was quite a little triumph for her.",

The professional\nelocutionist, Mrs. Evans, came and chatted with her, telling her that\nshe had a charming voice and \"interpreted\" her selections beautifully.\nEven the white-lace girl paid her a languid little compliment. They had\nsupper in the big, beautifully decorated dining room; Diana and Jane\nwere invited to partake of this, also, since they had come with Anne,\nbut Billy was nowhere to be found, having decamped in mortal fear\nof some such invitation. He was in waiting for them, with the team,\nhowever, when it was all over, and the three girls came merrily out into\nthe calm, white moonshine radiance. Anne breathed deeply, and looked\ninto the clear sky beyond the dark boughs of the firs.\nOh, it was good to be out again in the purity and silence of the night!\nHow great and still and wonderful everything was, with the murmur of the\nsea sounding through it and the darkling cliffs beyond like grim giants\nguarding enchanted coasts.\n\"Hasn't it been a perfectly splendid time?\" sighed Jane, as they drove\naway. \"I just wish I was a rich American and could spend my summer at\na hotel and wear jewels and low-necked dresses and have ice cream and\nchicken salad every blessed day. I'm sure it would be ever so much\nmore fun than teaching school. Anne, your recitation was simply great,\nalthough I thought at first you were never going to begin. I think it\nwas better than Mrs. Evans's.\"\n\"Oh, no, don't say things like that, Jane,\" said Anne quickly, \"because\nit sounds silly. It couldn't be better than Mrs. Evans's, you know, for\nshe is a professional, and I'm only a schoolgirl, with a little knack\nof reciting. I'm quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty\nwell.\"\n\"I've a compliment for you, Anne,\" said Diana. \"At least I think it\nmust be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. Part of it\nwas anyhow. There was an American sitting behind Jane and me--such a\nromantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. Josie Pye says he\nis a distinguished artist, and that her mother's cousin in Boston is\nmarried to a man that used to go to school with him. Well, we heard\nhim say--didn't we, Jane?--'Who is that girl on the platform with the\nsplendid Titian hair? She has a face I should like to paint.' There now,\nAnne. But what does Titian hair mean?\"\n\"Being interpreted it means plain red, I guess,\" laughed Anne. \"Titian\nwas a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.\"\n\"_Did_ you see all the diamonds those ladies wore?\" sighed Jane. \"They\nwere simply dazzling. Wouldn't you just love to be rich, girls?\"\n\"We _are_ rich,\" said Anne staunchly. \"Why, we have sixteen years to our\ncredit, and we're happy as queens, and we've all got imaginations, more\nor less. Look at that sea, girls--all silver and shadow and vision of\nthings not seen. We couldn't enjoy its loveliness any more if we had\nmillions of dollars and ropes of diamonds. You wouldn't change into any\nof those women if you could. Would you want to be that white-lace girl\nand wear a sour look all your life, as if you'd been born turning up\nyour nose at the world? Or the pink lady, kind and nice as she is, so\nstout and short that you'd really no figure at all? Or even Mrs. Evans,\nwith that sad, sad look in her eyes? She must have been dreadfully\nunhappy sometime to have such a look. You _know_ you wouldn't, Jane\nAndrews!\"\n\"I _don't_ know--exactly,\" said Jane unconvinced. \"I think diamonds would\ncomfort a person for a good deal.\"\n\"Well, I don't want to be anyone but myself, even if I go uncomforted by\ndiamonds all my life,\" declared Anne. \"I'm quite content to be Anne of\nGreen Gables, with my string of pearl beads.

Anne's outfit was\nample and pretty, for Matthew saw to that, and Marilla for once made\nno objections whatever to anything he purchased or suggested. More--one\nevening she went up to the east gable with her arms full of a delicate\npale green material.\n\"Anne, here's something for a nice light dress for you. I don't suppose\nyou really need it; you've plenty of pretty waists; but I thought maybe\nyou'd like something real dressy to wear if you were asked out anywhere\nof an evening in town, to a party or anything like that. I hear that\nJane and Ruby and Josie have got 'evening dresses,' as they call them,\nand I don't mean you shall be behind them. I got Mrs. Allan to help me\npick it in town last week, and we'll get Emily Gillis to make it for\nyou. Emily has got taste, and her fits aren't to be equaled.\"\n\"Oh, Marilla, it's just lovely,\" said Anne. \"Thank you so much. I don't\nbelieve you ought to be so kind to me--it's making it harder every day\nfor me to go away.\"\nThe green dress was made up with as many tucks and frills and shirrings\nas Emily's taste permitted. Anne put it on one evening for Matthew's\nand Marilla's benefit, and recited \"The Maiden's Vow\" for them in the\nkitchen. As Marilla watched the bright, animated face and graceful\nmotions her thoughts went back to the evening Anne had arrived at Green\nGables, and memory recalled a vivid picture of the odd, frightened child\nin her preposterous yellowish-brown wincey dress, the heartbreak looking\nout of her tearful eyes. Something in the memory brought tears to\nMarilla's own eyes.\n\"I declare, my recitation has made you cry, Marilla,\" said Anne gaily\nstooping over Marilla's chair to drop a butterfly kiss on that lady's\ncheek. \"Now, I call that a positive triumph.\"\n\"No, I wasn't crying over your piece,\" said Marilla, who would have\nscorned to be betrayed into such weakness by any poetry stuff. \"I just\ncouldn't help thinking of the little girl you used to be, Anne. And\nI was wishing you could have stayed a little girl, even with all your\nqueer ways. You've grown up now and you're going away; and you look so\ntall and stylish and so--so--different altogether in that dress--as if\nyou didn't belong in Avonlea at all--and I just got lonesome thinking it\nall over.\"\n\"Marilla!\" Anne sat down on Marilla's gingham lap, took Marilla's lined\nface between her hands, and looked gravely and tenderly into Marilla's\neyes. \"I'm not a bit changed--not really.

That first day passed pleasantly enough in a\nwhirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the\nprofessors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. Anne\nintended taking up the Second Year work being advised to do so by Miss\nStacy; Gilbert Blythe elected to do the same. This meant getting a\nFirst Class teacher's license in one year instead of two, if they were\nsuccessful; but it also meant much more and harder work. Jane, Ruby,\nJosie, Charlie, and Moody Spurgeon, not being troubled with the\nstirrings of ambition, were content to take up the Second Class work.\nAnne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in\na room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the\ntall, brown-haired boy across the room; and knowing him in the fashion\nshe did, did not help her much, as she reflected pessimistically.\nYet she was undeniably glad that they were in the same class; the old\nrivalry could still be carried on, and Anne would hardly have known what\nto do if it had been lacking.\n\"I wouldn't feel comfortable without it,\" she thought. \"Gilbert looks\nawfully determined. I suppose he's making up his mind, here and now, to\nwin the medal. What a splendid chin he has! I never noticed it before.\nI do wish Jane and Ruby had gone in for First Class, too. I suppose I\nwon't feel so much like a cat in a strange garret when I get acquainted,\nthough. I wonder which of the girls here are going to be my friends.\nIt's really an interesting speculation. Of course I promised Diana that\nno Queen's girl, no matter how much I liked her, should ever be as dear\nto me as she is; but I've lots of second-best affections to bestow. I\nlike the look of that girl with the brown eyes and the crimson waist.\nShe looks vivid and red-rosy; there's that pale, fair one gazing out of\nthe window. She has lovely hair, and looks as if she knew a thing or two\nabout dreams. I'd like to know them both--know them well--well enough to\nwalk with my arm about their waists, and call them nicknames. But just\nnow I don't know them and they don't know me, and probably don't want to\nknow me particularly. Oh, it's lonesome!\"",

Anne will not meet with any objectionable persons\nunder her roof. The table is good, and the house is near the Academy, in\na quiet neighborhood.\"\nAll this might be quite true, and indeed, proved to be so, but it did\nnot materially help Anne in the first agony of homesickness that seized\nupon her. She looked dismally about her narrow little room, with its\ndull-papered, pictureless walls, its small iron bedstead and empty\nbook-case; and a horrible choke came into her throat as she thought of\nher own white room at Green Gables, where she would have the pleasant\nconsciousness of a great green still outdoors, of sweet peas growing in\nthe garden, and moonlight falling on the orchard, of the brook below the\nslope and the spruce boughs tossing in the night wind beyond it, of a\nvast starry sky, and the light from Diana's window shining out through\nthe gap in the trees. Here there was nothing of this; Anne knew that\noutside of her window was a hard street, with a network of telephone\nwires shutting out the sky, the tramp of alien feet, and a thousand\nlights gleaming on stranger faces. She knew that she was going to cry,\nand fought against it.\n\"I _won't_ cry. It's silly--and weak--there's the third tear splashing\ndown by my nose. There are more coming! I must think of something funny\nto stop them. But there's nothing funny except what is connected with\nAvonlea, and that only makes things worse--four--five--I'm going home\nnext Friday, but that seems a hundred years away. Oh, Matthew is nearly\nhome by now--and Marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for\nhim--six--seven--eight--oh, there's no use in counting them! They're\ncoming in a flood presently.

As a part of\nAvonlea life even a Pye was welcome.\n\"I'm so glad you came up,\" Anne said sincerely.\n\"You've been crying,\" remarked Josie, with aggravating pity. \"I suppose\nyou're homesick--some people have so little self-control in that\nrespect. I've no intention of being homesick, I can tell you. Town's too\njolly after that poky old Avonlea. I wonder how I ever existed there so\nlong. You shouldn't cry, Anne; it isn't becoming, for your nose and eyes\nget red, and then you seem _all_ red. I'd a perfectly scrumptious time in\nthe Academy today. Our French professor is simply a duck. His moustache\nwould give you kerwollowps of the heart. Have you anything eatable\naround, Anne? I'm literally starving. Ah, I guessed likely Marilla 'd\nload you up with cake. That's why I called round. Otherwise I'd have\ngone to the park to hear the band play with Frank Stockley. He boards\nsame place as I do, and he's a sport. He noticed you in class today, and\nasked me who the red-headed girl was. I told him you were an orphan that\nthe Cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what you'd\nbeen before that.\"\nAnne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more\nsatisfactory than Josie Pye's companionship when Jane and Ruby appeared,\neach with an inch of Queen's color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned\nproudly to her coat. As Josie was not \"speaking\" to Jane just then she\nhad to subside into comparative harmlessness.\n\"Well,\" said Jane with a sigh, \"I feel as if I'd lived many moons since\nthe morning. I ought to be home studying my Virgil--that horrid old\nprofessor gave us twenty lines to start in on tomorrow. But I simply\ncouldn't settle down to study tonight. Anne, methinks I see the\ntraces of tears. If you've been crying _do_ own up. It will restore my\nself-respect, for I was shedding tears freely before Ruby came along. I\ndon't mind being a goose so much if somebody else is goosey, too. Cake?\nYou'll give me a teeny piece, won't you? Thank you. It has the real\nAvonlea flavor.\"\nRuby, perceiving the Queen's calendar lying on the table, wanted to know\nif Anne meant to try for the gold medal.\nAnne blushed and admitted she was thinking of it.\n\"Oh, that reminds me,\" said Josie, \"Queen's is to get one of the Avery\nscholarships after all. The word came today. Frank Stockley told me--his\nuncle is one of the board of governors, you know. It will be announced\nin the Academy tomorrow.\"\nAn Avery scholarship! Anne felt her heart beat more quickly, and the\nhorizons of her ambition shifted and broadened as if by magic. Before\nJosie had told the news Anne's highest pinnacle of aspiration had been\na teacher's provincial license, First Class, at the end of the year, and\nperhaps the medal! But now in one moment Anne saw herself winning\nthe Avery scholarship, taking an Arts course at Redmond College, and\ngraduating in a gown and mortar board, before the echo of Josie's words\nhad died away. For the Avery scholarship was in English, and Anne felt\nthat here her foot was on native heath.\nA wealthy manufacturer of New Brunswick had died and left part of his\nfortune to endow a large number of scholarships to be distributed\namong the various high schools and academies of the Maritime Provinces,\naccording to their respective standings. There had been much doubt\nwhether one would be allotted to Queen's, but the matter was settled at\nlast, and at the end of the year the graduate who made the highest mark\nin English and English Literature would win the scholarship--two hundred\nand fifty dollars a year for four years at Redmond College. No wonder\nthat Anne went to bed that night with tingling cheeks!\n\"I'll win that scholarship if hard work can do it,\" she resolved.\n\"Wouldn't Matthew be proud if I got to be a B.A.? Oh, it's delightful to\nhave ambitions. I'm so glad I have such a lot. And there never seems to\nbe any end to them--that's the best of it.

But she never sharpened the\nlatter on Anne, who continued to be a prime favorite with the critical\nold lady.\n\"That Anne-girl improves all the time,\" she said. \"I get tired of other\ngirls--there is such a provoking and eternal sameness about them.

I don't know that she is as amusing as she was when she was\na child, but she makes me love her and I like people who make me love\nthem.

But in Charlottetown harassed Queen's students thought and\ntalked only of examinations.\n\"It doesn't seem possible that the term is nearly over,\" said Anne.\n\"Why, last fall it seemed so long to look forward to--a whole winter\nof studies and classes. And here we are, with the exams looming up next\nweek. Girls, sometimes I feel as if those exams meant everything, but\nwhen I look at the big buds swelling on those chestnut trees and\nthe misty blue air at the end of the streets they don't seem half so\nimportant.\"\nJane and Ruby and Josie, who had dropped in, did not take this view\nof it. To them the coming examinations were constantly very important\nindeed--far more important than chestnut buds or Maytime hazes. It was\nall very well for Anne, who was sure of passing at least, to have her\nmoments of belittling them, but when your whole future depended on\nthem--as the girls truly thought theirs did--you could not regard them\nphilosophically.",

I'm afraid you've been working too hard. You must take\na rest, now that I'm home. I'm just going to take this one day off to\nvisit all the dear old spots and hunt up my old dreams, and then it will\nbe your turn to be lazy while I do the work.\"\nMarilla smiled affectionately at her girl.\n\"It's not the work--it's my head.

There is a distinguished oculist coming to the Island the\nlast of June and the doctor says I must see him. I guess I'll have to.\nI can't read or sew with any comfort now. Well, Anne, you've done real\nwell at Queen's I must say.

I wanted Matthew to put it in the\nSavings Bank in the first place, but old Mr. Abbey was a great friend of\nfather's and he'd always banked with him. Matthew said any bank with him\nat the head of it was good enough for anybody.\"\n\"I think he has only been its nominal head for many years,\" said\nAnne. \"He is a very old man; his nephews are really at the head of the\ninstitution.\"\n\"Well, when Rachel told us that, I wanted Matthew to draw our money\nright out and he said he'd think of it.

            "text": "said Mrs. Allan.\nAnne did not reply; she said good night and went slowly back to green\nGables. Marilla was sitting on the front door-steps and Anne sat down\nbeside her. The door was open behind them, held back by a big pink conch\nshell with hints of sea sunsets in its smooth inner convolutions.\nAnne gathered some sprays of pale-yellow honeysuckle and put them in\nher hair. She liked the delicious hint of fragrance, as some aerial\nbenediction, above her every time she moved.\n\"Doctor Spencer was here while you were away,\" Marilla said. \"He says\nthat the specialist will be in town tomorrow and he insists that I must\ngo in and have my eyes examined. I suppose I'd better go and have it\nover. I'll be more than thankful if the man can give me the right kind\nof glasses to suit my eyes. You won't mind staying here alone while I'm\naway, will you? Martin will have to drive me in and there's ironing and\nbaking to do.\"\n\"I shall be all right. Diana will come over for company for me. I shall\nattend to the ironing and baking beautifully--you needn't fear that I'll\nstarch the handkerchiefs or flavor the cake with liniment.\"\nMarilla laughed.\n\"What a girl you were for making mistakes in them days, Anne. You were\nalways getting into scrapes. I did use to think you were possessed. Do\nyou mind the time you dyed your hair?\"\n\"Yes, indeed. I shall never forget it,\" smiled Anne, touching the heavy\nbraid of hair that was wound about her shapely head. \"I laugh a little\nnow sometimes when I think what a worry my hair used to be to me--but I\ndon't laugh _much_, because it was a very real trouble then. I did suffer\nterribly over my hair and my freckles. My freckles are really gone; and\npeople are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now--all but Josie\nPye. She informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder\nthan ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked\nme if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. Marilla, I've\nalmost decided to give up trying to like Josie Pye. I've made what I\nwould once have called a heroic effort to like her, but Josie Pye won't\n_be_ liked.\"\n\"Josie is a Pye,\" said Marilla sharply, \"so she can't help being\ndisagreeable. I suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in\nsociety, but I must say I don't know what it is any more than I know the\nuse of thistles. Is Josie going to teach?\"\n\"No, she is going back to Queen's next year. So are Moody Spurgeon and\nCharlie Sloane. Jane and Ruby are going to teach and they have both got\nschools--Jane at Newbridge and Ruby at some place up west.\"\n\"Gilbert Blythe is going to teach too, isn't he?\"\n\"Yes\"--briefly.\n\"What a nice-looking fellow he is,\" said Marilla absently. \"I saw him in\nchurch last Sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. He looks a lot like\nhis father did at the same age. John Blythe was a nice boy. We used to\nbe real good friends, he and I. People called him my beau.\"\nAnne looked up with swift interest.\n\"Oh, Marilla--and what happened?--why didn't you--\"\n\"We had a quarrel. I wouldn't forgive him when he asked me to. I meant\nto, after awhile--but I was sulky and angry and I wanted to punish him\nfirst. He never came back--the Blythes were all mighty independent. But\nI always felt--rather sorry. I've always kind of wished I'd forgiven him\nwhen I had the chance.\"\n\"So you've had a bit of romance in your life, too,\" said Anne softly.\n\"Yes, I suppose you might call it that. You wouldn't think so to look at\nme, would you? But you never can tell about people from their outsides.\nEverybody has forgot about me and John. I'd forgotten myself. But it all\ncame back to me when I saw Gilbert last Sunday.\"\nCHAPTER XXXVIII. The Bend in the road\nMARILLA went to town the next day and returned in the evening. Anne had\ngone over to Orchard Slope with Diana and came back to find Marilla in\nthe kitchen, sitting by the table with her head leaning on her hand.\nSomething in her dejected attitude struck a chill to Anne's heart. She\nhad never seen Marilla sit limply inert like that.\n\"Are you very tired, Marilla?\"\n\"Yes--no--I don't know,\" said Marilla wearily, looking up. \"I suppose I\nam tired but I haven't thought about it. It's not that.\"\n\"Did you see the oculist? What did he say?\" asked Anne anxiously.\n\"Yes, I saw him. He examined my eyes. He says that if I give up all\nreading and sewing entirely and any kind of work that strains the eyes,\nand if I'm careful not to cry, and if I wear the glasses he's given me\nhe thinks my eyes may not get any worse and my headaches will be cured.\nBut if I don't he says I'll certainly be stone-blind in six months.\nBlind! Anne, just think of it!\"\nFor a minute Anne, after her first quick exclamation of dismay, was\nsilent. It seemed to her that she could _not_ speak. Then she said\nbravely, but with a catch in her voice:\n\"Marilla, _don't_ think of it. You know he has given you hope. If you are\ncareful you won't lose your sight altogether; and if his glasses cure\nyour headaches it will be a great thing.\"\n\"I don't call it much hope,\" said Marilla bitterly. \"What am I to live\nfor if I can't read or sew or do anything like that? I might as well\nbe blind--or dead. And as for crying, I can't help that when I get\nlonesome. But there, it's no good talking about it. If you'll get me\na cup of tea I'll be thankful. I'm about done out. Don't say anything\nabout this to any one for a spell yet, anyway. I can't bear that folks\nshould come here to question and sympathize and talk about it.\"",

            "text": "When Marilla had eaten her lunch Anne persuaded her to go to bed. Then\nAnne went herself to the east gable and sat down by her window in the\ndarkness alone with her tears and her heaviness of heart. How sadly\nthings had changed since she had sat there the night after coming home!\nThen she had been full of hope and joy and the future had looked rosy\nwith promise. Anne felt as if she had lived years since then, but before\nshe went to bed there was a smile on her lips and peace in her heart.\nShe had looked her duty courageously in the face and found it a\nfriend--as duty ever is when we meet it frankly.\nOne afternoon a few days later Marilla came slowly in from the front\nyard where she had been talking to a caller--a man whom Anne knew by\nsight as Sadler from Carmody. Anne wondered what he could have been\nsaying to bring that look to Marilla's face.\n\"What did Mr. Sadler want, Marilla?\"\nMarilla sat down by the window and looked at Anne. There were tears in\nher eyes in defiance of the oculist's prohibition and her voice broke as\nshe said:\n\"He heard that I was going to sell Green Gables and he wants to buy it.\"\n\"Buy it! Buy Green Gables?\" Anne wondered if she had heard aright. \"Oh,\nMarilla, you don't mean to sell Green Gables!\"\n\"Anne, I don't know what else is to be done. I've thought it all over.\nIf my eyes were strong I could stay here and make out to look after\nthings and manage, with a good hired man. But as it is I can't. I may\nlose my sight altogether; and anyway I'll not be fit to run things. Oh,\nI never thought I'd live to see the day when I'd have to sell my home.\nBut things would only go behind worse and worse all the time, till\nnobody would want to buy it. Every cent of our money went in that bank;\nand there's some notes Matthew gave last fall to pay. Mrs. Lynde advises\nme to sell the farm and board somewhere--with her I suppose. It won't\nbring much--it's small and the buildings are old. But it'll be enough\nfor me to live on I reckon. I'm thankful you're provided for with that\nscholarship, Anne. I'm sorry you won't have a home to come to in your\nvacations, that's all, but I suppose you'll manage somehow.\"\nMarilla broke down and wept bitterly.\n\"You mustn't sell Green Gables,\" said Anne resolutely.\n\"Oh, Anne, I wish I didn't have to. But you can see for yourself. I\ncan't stay here alone. I'd go crazy with trouble and loneliness. And my\nsight would go--I know it would.\"",

I'm going to be a good teacher--and I'm going to save your\neyesight. Besides, I mean to study at home here and take a little\ncollege course all by myself. Oh, I've dozens of plans, Marilla. I've\nbeen thinking them out for a week. I shall give life here my best, and\nI believe it will give its best to me in return. When I left Queen's my\nfuture seemed to stretch out before me like a straight road. I thought\nI could see along it for many a milestone. Now there is a bend in it. I\ndon't know what lies around the bend, but I'm going to believe that the\nbest does. It has a fascination of its own, that bend, Marilla. I wonder\nhow the road beyond it goes--what there is of green glory and\nsoft, checkered light and shadows--what new landscapes--what new\nbeauties--what curves and hills and valleys further on.\"\n\"I don't feel as if I ought to let you give it up,\" said Marilla,\nreferring to the scholarship.\n\"But you can't prevent me. I'm sixteen and a half, 'obstinate as a\nmule,' as Mrs. Lynde once told me,\" laughed Anne. \"Oh, Marilla, don't\nyou go pitying me. I don't like to be pitied, and there is no need\nfor it. I'm heart glad over the very thought of staying at dear Green\nGables. Nobody could love it as you and I do--so we must keep it.\"\n\"You blessed girl!\" said Marilla, yielding. \"I feel as if you'd given me\nnew life. I guess I ought to stick out and make you go to college--but\nI know I can't, so I ain't going to try. I'll make it up to you though,\nAnne.\"\nWhen it became noised abroad in Avonlea that Anne Shirley had given up\nthe idea of going to college and intended to stay home and teach there\nwas a good deal of discussion over it. Most of the good folks, not\nknowing about Marilla's eyes, thought she was foolish. Mrs. Allan did\nnot. She told Anne so in approving words that brought tears of pleasure\nto the girl's eyes. Neither did good Mrs. Lynde. She came up one evening\nand found Anne and Marilla sitting at the front door in the warm,\nscented summer dusk. They liked to sit there when the twilight came down\nand the white moths flew about in the garden and the odor of mint filled\nthe dewy air.\nMrs. Rachel deposited her substantial person upon the stone bench by the\ndoor, behind which grew a row of tall pink and yellow hollyhocks, with a\nlong breath of mingled weariness and relief.\n\"I declare I'm getting glad to sit down. I've been on my feet all day,\nand two hundred pounds is a good bit for two feet to carry round. It's\na great blessing not to be fat, Marilla. I hope you appreciate it. Well,\nAnne, I hear you've given up your notion of going to college. I was\nreal glad to hear it. You've got as much education now as a woman can be\ncomfortable with. I don't believe in girls going to college with the men\nand cramming their heads full of Latin and Greek and all that nonsense.\"\n\"But I'm going to study Latin and Greek just the same, Mrs. Lynde,\" said\nAnne laughing. \"I'm going to take my Arts course right here at Green\nGables, and study everything that I would at college.\"\nMrs. Lynde lifted her hands in holy horror.\n\"Anne Shirley, you'll kill yourself.\"\n\"Not a bit of it. I shall thrive on it. Oh, I'm not going to overdo\nthings. As 'Josiah Allen's wife,' says, I shall be 'mejum'. But I'll\nhave lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and I've no\nvocation for fancy work. I'm going to teach over at Carmody, you know.\"\n\"I don't know it. I guess you're going to teach right here in Avonlea.\nThe trustees have decided to give you the school.\"\n\"Mrs. Lynde!\" cried Anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. \"Why, I\nthought they had promised it to Gilbert Blythe!\"\n\"So they did. But as soon as Gilbert heard that you had applied for it\nhe went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,\nyou know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested\nthat they accept yours. He said he was going to teach at White Sands. Of\ncourse he knew how much you wanted to stay with Marilla, and I must\nsay I think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, that's what. Real\nself-sacrificing, too, for he'll have his board to pay at White Sands,\nand everybody knows he's got to earn his own way through college. So the\ntrustees decided to take you. I was tickled to death when Thomas came\nhome and told me.\"\n\"I don't feel that I ought to take it,\" murmured Anne. \"I mean--I don't\nthink I ought to let Gilbert make such a sacrifice for--for me.\"\n\"I guess you can't prevent him now. He's signed papers with the White\nSands trustees. So it wouldn't do him any good now if you were to\nrefuse. Of course you'll take the school. You'll get along all right,\nnow that there are no Pyes going. Josie was the last of them, and a\ngood thing she was, that's what. There's been some Pye or other going to\nAvonlea school for the last twenty years, and I guess their mission in\nlife was to keep school teachers reminded that earth isn't their home.\nBless my heart! What does all that winking and blinking at the Barry\ngable mean?\"",

Mrs. Lynde looked after her indulgently.\n\"There's a good deal of the child about her yet in some ways.\"\n\"There's a good deal more of the woman about her in others,\" retorted\nMarilla, with a momentary return of her old crispness.\nBut crispness was no longer Marilla's distinguishing characteristic. As\nMrs. Lynde told her Thomas that night.\n\"Marilla Cuthbert has got _mellow_. That's what.\"\nAnne went to the little Avonlea graveyard the next evening to put fresh\nflowers on Matthew's grave and water the Scotch rosebush. She lingered\nthere until dusk, liking the peace and calm of the little place,\nwith its poplars whose rustle was like low, friendly speech, and its\nwhispering grasses growing at will among the graves. When she finally\nleft it and walked down the long hill that sloped to the Lake of Shining\nWaters it was past sunset and all Avonlea lay before her in a dreamlike\nafterlight--\"a haunt of ancient peace.\" There was a freshness in the\nair as of a wind that had blown over honey-sweet fields of clover. Home\nlights twinkled out here and there among the homestead trees. Beyond lay\nthe sea, misty and purple, with its haunting, unceasing murmur. The west\nwas a glory of soft mingled hues, and the pond reflected them all in\nstill softer shadings. The beauty of it all thrilled Anne's heart, and\nshe gratefully opened the gates of her soul to it.\n\"Dear old world,\" she murmured, \"you are very lovely, and I am glad to\nbe alive in you.\"\nHalfway down the hill a tall lad came whistling out of a gate before the\nBlythe homestead. It was Gilbert, and the whistle died on his lips as he\nrecognized Anne. He lifted his cap courteously, but he would have passed\non in silence, if Anne had not stopped and held out her hand.\n\"Gilbert,\" she said, with scarlet cheeks, \"I want to thank you for\ngiving up the school for me. It was very good of you--and I want you to\nknow that I appreciate it.\"\nGilbert took the offered hand eagerly.\n\"It wasn't particularly good of me at all, Anne. I was pleased to be\nable to do you some small service. Are we going to be friends after\nthis? Have you really forgiven me my old fault?\"\nAnne laughed and tried unsuccessfully to withdraw her hand.\n\"I forgave you that day by the pond landing, although I didn't know\nit. What a stubborn little goose I was. I've been--I may as well make a\ncomplete confession--I've been sorry ever since.\"\n\"We are going to be the best of friends,\" said Gilbert, jubilantly. \"We\nwere born to be good friends, Anne. You've thwarted destiny enough. I\nknow we can help each other in many ways. You are going to keep up your\nstudies, aren't you? So am I. Come, I'm going to walk home with you.\"\nMarilla looked curiously at Anne when the latter entered the kitchen.\n\"Who was that came up the lane with you, Anne?\"\n\"Gilbert Blythe,\" answered Anne, vexed to find herself blushing. \"I met\nhim on Barry's hill.\"\n\"I didn't think you and Gilbert Blythe were such good friends that you'd\nstand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,\" said Marilla with a\ndry smile.\n\"We haven't been--we've been good enemies. But we have decided that it\nwill be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. Were we\nreally there half an hour? It seemed just a few minutes. But, you see,\nwe have five years' lost conversations to catch up with, Marilla.\"\nAnne sat long at her window that night companioned by a glad content.\nThe wind purred softly in the cherry boughs, and the mint breaths came\nup to her. The stars twinkled over the pointed firs in the hollow and\nDiana's light gleamed through the old gap.\nAnne's horizons had closed in since the night she had sat there after\ncoming home from Queen's; but if the path set before her feet was to be\nnarrow she knew that flowers of quiet happiness would bloom along it.\nThe joy of sincere work and worthy aspiration and congenial friendship\nwere to be hers; nothing could rob her of her birthright of fancy or her\nideal world of dreams. And there was always the bend in the road!",
