      "text": "Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the\nBuonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,\nif you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that\nAntichrist\u2014I really believe he is Antichrist\u2014I will have nothing\nmore to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my\n'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I\nhave frightened you\u2014sit down and tell me all the news.\"\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna P\u00e1vlovna\nSch\u00e9rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress M\u00e1rya F\u00ebdorovna.\nWith these words she greeted Prince Vas\u00edli Kur\u00e1gin, a man of high\nrank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna\nP\u00e1vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering\nfrom la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used\nonly by the elite.\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered\nby a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\"If you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the\nprospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible,\nI shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10\u2014Annette\nSch\u00e9rer.\"\n\"Heavens! what a virulent attack!\" replied the prince, not in the\nleast disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an\nembroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on\nhis breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that\nrefined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and\nwith the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance\nwho had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna P\u00e1vlovna,\nkissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head,\nand complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's\nmind at rest,\" said he without altering his tone, beneath the\npoliteness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony\ncould be discerned.\n\"Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times\nlike these if one has any feeling?\" said Anna P\u00e1vlovna. \"You are\nstaying the whole evening, I hope?\"\n\"And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I\nmust put in an appearance there,\" said the prince. \"My daughter is\ncoming for me to take me there.\"\n\"I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these\nfestivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\"\n\"If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have\nbeen put off,\" said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force\nof habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\"Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novos\u00edltsev's\ndispatch? You know everything.\"\n\"What can one say about it?\" replied the prince in a cold, listless\ntone. \"What has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has\nburnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\"\nPrince Vas\u00edli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale\npart. Anna P\u00e1vlovna Sch\u00e9rer on the contrary, despite her forty years,\noverflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had\nbecome her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not\nfeel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the\nexpectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it\ndid not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed,\nas in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect,\nwhich she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to\ncorrect.\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna P\u00e1vlovna burst\nout:\n\"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand\nthings, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She\nis betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign\nrecognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one\nthing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform\nthe noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will\nnot forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of\nrevolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of\nthis murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just\none.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial\nspirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's\nloftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to\nfind, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer\ndid Novos\u00edltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot\nunderstand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for\nhimself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they\npromised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not\nperform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and\nthat all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a\nword that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian\nneutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty\ndestiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!\"\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n\"I think,\" said the prince with a smile, \"that if you had been\nsent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King\nof Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me\na cup of tea?\"\n\"In a moment. \u00c0 propos,\" she added, becoming calm again, \"I am\nexpecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who\nis connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best\nFrench families. He is one of the genuine \u00e9migr\u00e9s, the good ones. And\nalso the Abb\u00e9 Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been\nreceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?\"\n\"I shall be delighted to meet them,\" said the prince. \"But\ntell me,\" he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just\noccurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief\nmotive of his visit, \"is it true that the Dowager Empress wants\nBaron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all\naccounts is a poor creature.\"\nPrince Vas\u00edli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were\ntrying through the Dowager Empress M\u00e1rya F\u00ebdorovna to secure it for\nthe baron.\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor\nanyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was\npleased with.\n\"Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her\nsister,\" was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\nAs she named the Empress, Anna P\u00e1vlovna's face suddenly assumed an\nexpression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with\nsadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious\npatroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke\nbeaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.",

But, with the womanly and\ncourtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna P\u00e1vlovna\nwished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man\nrecommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she\nsaid:\n\"Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came\nout everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly\nbeautiful.\"\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n\"I often think,\" she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer\nto the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political\nand social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate\nconversation\u2014\"I often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life\nare distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children?\nI don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like him,\" she\nadded in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows.\n\"Two such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than\nanyone, and so you don't deserve to have them.\"\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n\"I can't help it,\" said the prince. \"Lavater would have said I\nlack the bump of paternity.\"\n\"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know\nI am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\" (and her\nface assumed its melancholy expression), \"he was mentioned at Her\nMajesty's and you were pitied....\"\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,\nawaiting a reply. He frowned.\n\"What would you have me do?\" he said at last. \"You know I did all\na father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools.\nHippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That\nis the only difference between them.\" He said this smiling in a way\nmore natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round\nhis mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and\nunpleasant.\n\"And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a\nfather there would be nothing I could reproach you with,\" said Anna\nP\u00e1vlovna, looking up pensively.\n\"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my\nchildren are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That\nis how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!\"\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a\ngesture. Anna P\u00e1vlovna meditated.\n\"Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?\" she\nasked. \"They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I\ndon't feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who\nis very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess\nMary Bolk\u00f3nskaya.\"\nPrince Vas\u00edli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and\nperception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of\nthe head that he was considering this information.\n\"Do you know,\" he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad\ncurrent of his thoughts, \"that Anatole is costing me forty thousand\nrubles a year? And,\" he went on after a pause, \"what will it be in\nfive years, if he goes on like this?\" Presently he added: \"That's\nwhat we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours\nrich?\"\n\"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is\nthe well-known Prince Bolk\u00f3nski who had to retire from the army under\nthe late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is\nvery clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy.\nShe has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately.\nHe is an aide-de-camp of Kut\u00fazov's and will be here tonight.\"\n\"Listen, dear Annette,\" said the prince, suddenly taking Anna\nP\u00e1vlovna's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. \"Arrange\nthat affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe\nwith an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich\nand of good family and that's all I want.\"\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the\nmaid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro\nas he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.",

The highest\nPetersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age\nand character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.\nPrince Vas\u00edli's daughter, the beautiful H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, came to take her\nfather to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a ball dress and\nher badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya,\nknown as la femme la plus s\u00e9duisante de P\u00e9tersbourg, * was also there.\nShe had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did\nnot go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince\nVas\u00edli's son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced.\nThe Abb\u00e9 Morio and many others had also come.\n* The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.\nTo each new arrival Anna P\u00e1vlovna said, \"You have not yet seen my\naunt,\" or \"You do not know my aunt?\" and very gravely conducted\nhim or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her\ncap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests\nbegan to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her\naunt, Anna P\u00e1vlovna mentioned each one's name and then left them.\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not\none of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them\ncared about; Anna P\u00e1vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and\nsolemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in\nthe same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her\nMajesty, \"who, thank God, was better today.\" And each visitor,\nthough politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman\nwith a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not\nreturn to her the whole evening.",

Prince Vas\u00edli's words frightened her, an\nembittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment;\nthen she smiled again and clutched Prince Vas\u00edli's arm more tightly.\n\"Listen to me, Prince,\" said she. \"I have never yet asked you\nfor anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my\nfather's friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God's sake to\ndo this for my son\u2014and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,\"\nshe added hurriedly. \"No, don't be angry, but promise!

I think it will\nbe difficult to return to the old regime.\"\n\"From what I have heard,\" said Pierre, blushing and breaking into\nthe conversation, \"almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to\nBonaparte's side.\"\n\"It is the Buonapartists who say that,\" replied the vicomte without\nlooking at Pierre. \"At the present time it is difficult to know the\nreal state of French public opinion.\"\n\"Bonaparte has said so,\" remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic\nsmile.\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his\nremarks at him, though without looking at him.",

Oh!\" exclaimed several voices.\n\"Capital!\" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his\nknee with the palm of his hand.\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his\naudience over his spectacles and continued.\n\"I say so,\" he continued desperately, \"because the Bourbons fled\nfrom the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone\nunderstood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good,\nhe could not stop short for the sake of one man's life.\"\n\"Won't you come over to the other table?\" suggested Anna\nP\u00e1vlovna.\nBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n\"No,\" cried he, becoming more and more eager, \"Napoleon is great\nbecause he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,\npreserved all that was good in it\u2014equality of citizenship and freedom\nof speech and of the press\u2014and only for that reason did he obtain\npower.\"\n\"Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to\ncommit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have\ncalled him a great man,\" remarked the vicomte.\n\"He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might\nrid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great\nman. The Revolution was a grand thing!\" continued Monsieur Pierre,\nbetraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme\nyouth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.\n\"What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...\nBut won't you come to this other table?\" repeated Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\"Rousseau's Contrat Social,\" said the vicomte with a tolerant\nsmile.\n\"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.\"\n\"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,\" again interjected an\nironical voice.\n\"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most\nimportant. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from\nprejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon\nhas retained in full force.\"\n\"Liberty and equality,\" said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at\nlast deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words\nwere, \"high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does\nnot love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and\nequality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the\ncontrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.\"\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the\nvicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of\nPierre's outburst Anna P\u00e1vlovna, despite her social experience, was\nhorror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words\nhad not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was\nimpossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in\na vigorous attack on the orator.",

Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge\nred hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing\nroom and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something\nparticularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was\nabsent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the\ngeneral's three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume,\ntill the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and\ninability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by\nhis kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna P\u00e1vlovna turned toward\nhim and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his\nindiscretion, nodded and said: \"I hope to see you again, but I also\nhope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.\"\nWhen she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody\nsaw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, \"Opinions are\nopinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.\" And\neveryone, including Anna P\u00e1vlovna, felt this.\nPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders\nto the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened\nindifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also\ncome into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant\nprincess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.\n\"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold,\" said the little princess,\ntaking leave of Anna P\u00e1vlovna. \"It is settled,\" she added in a low\nvoice.\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she\ncontemplated between Anatole and the little princess' sister-in-law.\n\"I rely on you, my dear,\" said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, also in a low tone.\n\"Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au\nrevoir! \"\u2014and she left the hall.",

In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but\u2014I do not\nknow how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....\"\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract\nconversation.\n\"One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have\nyou at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a\ndiplomatist?\" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.\nPierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.\n\"Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either the one or the\nother.\"\n\"But you must decide on something! Your father expects it.\"\nPierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abb\u00e9 as tutor,\nand had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow\nhis father dismissed the abb\u00e9 and said to the young man, \"Now go\nto Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to\nanything. Here is a letter to Prince Vas\u00edli, and here is money. Write\nto me all about it, and I will help you in everything.\" Pierre had\nalready been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided\non anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking.\nPierre rubbed his forehead.\n\"But he must be a Freemason,\" said he, referring to the abb\u00e9 whom\nhe had met that evening.\n\"That is all nonsense.\" Prince Andrew again interrupted him, \"let\nus talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?\"\n\"No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted\nto tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for\nfreedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army;\nbut to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is\nnot right.\"\nPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre's childish words.\nHe put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such\nnonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other\nanswer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this na\u00efve question.\n\"If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no\nwars,\" he said.\n\"And that would be splendid,\" said Pierre.\nPrince Andrew smiled ironically.\n\"Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....\"\n\"Well, why are you going to the war?\" asked Pierre.\n\"What for? I don't know. I must. Besides that I am going....\" He\npaused. \"I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit\nme!\"",

      "text": "The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre\ncontinually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead\nwith his small hand.\n\"Let us go and have supper,\" he said with a sigh, going to the door.\nThey entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room.\nEverything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore\nthat imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married.\nHalfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and,\nwith a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on\nhis face, began to talk\u2014as one who has long had something on his mind\nand suddenly determines to speak out.\n\"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: never marry\ntill you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of,\nand until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen\nher plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable\nmistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing\u2014or all that is\ngood and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles.\nYes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise. If you marry\nexpecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every\nstep that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing\nroom, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an\nidiot!... But what's the good?...\" and he waved his arm.\nPierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and\nthe good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend\nin amazement.\n\"My wife,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"is an excellent woman, one\nof those rare women with whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, what\nwould I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to\nwhom I mention this, because I like you.\"\nAs he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolk\u00f3nski\nwho had lolled in Anna P\u00e1vlovna's easy chairs and with half-closed\neyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his\nthin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which\nthe fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant\nlight. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary\ntimes, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid\nirritation.\n\"You don't understand why I say this,\" he continued, \"but it is\nthe whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,\" said\nhe (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), \"but Bonaparte when\nhe worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing\nbut his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with\na woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you\nhave of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with\nregret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality\u2014these are\nthe enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war,\nthe greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for\nnothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,\" continued Prince\nAndrew, \"and at Anna P\u00e1vlovna's they listen to me. And that stupid\nset without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only\nknew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is\nright. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything\u2014that's what\nwomen are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them\nin society it seems as if there were something in them, but there's\nnothing, nothing, nothing! No, don't marry, my dear fellow; don't\nmarry!\" concluded Prince Andrew.\n\"It seems funny to me,\" said Pierre, \"that you, you should\nconsider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have\neverything before you, everything. And you....\"\nHe did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he\nthought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.\n\"How can he talk like that?\" thought Pierre. He considered his\nfriend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the\nhighest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might\nbe best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at\nPrince Andrew's calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary\nmemory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything,\nand had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for\nwork and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew's lack\nof capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was\nparticularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a\nsign of strength.\nEven in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise\nand commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels\nthat they may run smoothly.\n\"My part is played out,\" said Prince Andrew. \"What's the use of\ntalking about me? Let us talk about you,\" he added after a silence,\nsmiling at his reassuring thoughts.\nThat smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.\n\"But what is there to say about me?\" said Pierre, his face relaxing\ninto a careless, merry smile. \"What am I? An illegitimate son!\"\nHe suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great\neffort to say this. \"Without a name and without means... And it\nreally...\" But he did not say what \"it really\" was. \"For the\npresent I am free and am all right. Only I haven't the least idea what\nI am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.\"\nPrince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance\u2014friendly and\naffectionate as it was\u2014expressed a sense of his own superiority.\n\"I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our\nwhole set. Yes, you're all right! Choose what you will; it's all the\nsame. You'll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting\nthose Kur\u00e1gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so\nbadly\u2014all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!\"\n\"What would you have, my dear fellow?\" answered Pierre, shrugging\nhis shoulders. \"Women, my dear fellow; women!\"\n\"I don't understand it,\" replied Prince Andrew. \"Women who are\ncomme il faut, that's a different matter; but the Kur\u00e1gins' set of\nwomen, 'women and wine' I don't understand!\"\nPierre was staying at Prince Vas\u00edli Kur\u00e1gin's and sharing the\ndissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to\nreform by marrying him to Prince Andrew's sister.\n\"Do you know?\" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy\nthought, \"seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such\na life I can't decide or think properly about anything. One's head\naches, and one spends all one's money. He asked me for tonight, but I\nwon't go.\"\n\"You give me your word of honor not to go?\"\n\"On my honor!\"",

Good man!\" cried he, addressing Pierre.\nAnother voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,\nparticularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober\nring, cried from the window: \"Come here; part the bets!\" This was\nD\u00f3lokhov, an officer of the Sem\u00ebnov regiment, a notorious gambler and\nduelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him\nmerrily.\n\"I don't understand. What's it all about?\"\n\"Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,\" said Anatole, and\ntaking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.\n\"First of all you must drink!\"\nPierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at\nthe tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening\nto their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass while\nexplaining that D\u00f3lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval\nofficer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge\nof the third floor window with his legs hanging out.\n\"Go on, you must drink it all,\" said Anatole, giving Pierre the last\nglass, \"or I won't let you go!\"\n\"No, I won't,\" said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up\nto the window.\nD\u00f3lokhov was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly and distinctly\nrepeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to\nAnatole and Pierre.\nD\u00f3lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He\nwas about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache,\nso that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly\nseen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle\nof the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm\nlower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually\nround the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute,\ninsolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it\nimpossible not to notice his face. D\u00f3lokhov was a man of small means\nand no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of\nrubles, D\u00f3lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a\nfooting that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him\nmore than they did Anatole. D\u00f3lokhov could play all games and nearly\nalways won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness.\nBoth Kur\u00e1gin and D\u00f3lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes\nand scapegraces of Petersburg.\nThe bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone\nfrom sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who\nwere evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of\nthe gentlemen around.\nAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to\nsmash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but\ncould not move it. He smashed a pane.\n\"You have a try, Hercules,\" said he, turning to Pierre.\nPierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with\na crash.\n\"Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on,\" said\nD\u00f3lokhov.\n\"Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?\" said Anatole.\n\"First-rate,\" said Pierre, looking at D\u00f3lokhov, who with a bottle\nof rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of\nthe sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.\nD\u00f3lokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window\nsill. \"Listen!\" cried he, standing there and addressing those in the\nroom. All were silent.\n\"I bet fifty imperials\"\u2014he spoke French that the Englishman might\nunderstand him, but he did not speak it very well\u2014\"I bet fifty\nimperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?\" added he,\naddressing the Englishman.\n\"No, fifty,\" replied the latter.\n\"All right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of\nrum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this",

Is that right?\"\n\"Quite right,\" said the Englishman.\nAnatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons\nof his coat and looking down at him\u2014the Englishman was short\u2014began\nrepeating the terms of the wager to him in English.\n\"Wait!\" cried D\u00f3lokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window\nsill to attract attention. \"Wait a bit, Kur\u00e1gin. Listen! If\nanyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you\nunderstand?\"\nThe Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to\naccept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though\nhe kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating\nD\u00f3lokhov's words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the\nLife Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window\nsill, leaned over, and looked down.\n\"Oh! Oh! Oh!\" he muttered, looking down from the window at the\nstones of the pavement.\n\"Shut up!\" cried D\u00f3lokhov, pushing him away from the window. The\nlad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.\nPlacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily,\nD\u00f3lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered\nhis legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself\non his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to\nthe left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and\nplaced them on the window sill, though it was already quite light.\nD\u00f3lokhov's back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit\nup from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in\nfront. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others\npresent, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted\nto seize hold of D\u00f3lokhov's shirt.\n\"I say, this is folly! He'll be killed,\" said this more sensible\nman.\nAnatole stopped him.\n\"Don't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed.\nEh?... What then?... Eh?\"\nD\u00f3lokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged\nhimself on his seat.\n\"If anyone comes meddling again,\" said he, emitting the words\nseparately through his thin compressed lips, \"I will throw him down\nthere. Now then!\"\nSaying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle\nand lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand\nto balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some\nbroken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the\nwindow and from D\u00f3lokhov's back. Anatole stood erect with staring\neyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man\nwho had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw\nhimself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from\nwhich a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed\nhorror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes.\nD\u00f3lokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown\nfurther back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand\nholding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the\neffort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher\nand his head tilting yet further back. \"Why is it so long?\" thought\nPierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed.\nSuddenly D\u00f3lokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm\ntrembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip\nas he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and\narm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch\nthe window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered\nhis eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was\naware of a stir all around. He looked up: D\u00f3lokhov was standing on the\nwindow sill, with a pale but radiant face.\n\"It's empty.\"\nHe threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. D\u00f3lokhov\njumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.",

And they have had to suffer for it.\nD\u00f3lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bez\u00fakhov's son sent\nback to Moscow. Anatole Kur\u00e1gin's father managed somehow to get his\nson's affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.\"\n\"But what have they been up to?\" asked the countess.\n\"They are regular brigands, especially D\u00f3lokhov,\" replied the\nvisitor. \"He is a son of M\u00e1rya Iv\u00e1novna D\u00f3lokhova, such a worthy\nwoman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere,\nput it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The\npolice tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied\na policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka\nCanal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his\nback!\"\n\"What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!\" shouted\nthe count, dying with laughter.\n\"Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?\"\nYet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.\n\"It was all they could do to rescue the poor man,\" continued the\nvisitor. \"And to think it is Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov's son\nwho amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so\nwell educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has\ndone for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in\nspite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite\ndeclined: I have my daughters to consider.\"\n\"Why do you say this young man is so rich?\" asked the countess,\nturning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention.\n\"His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is\nillegitimate.\"\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand.\n\"I should think he has a score of them.\"\nPrincess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently\nwishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in\nsociety.\n\"The fact of the matter is,\" said she significantly, and also in a\nhalf whisper, \"everyone knows Count Cyril's reputation.... He has\nlost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.\"\n\"How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!\" remarked the\ncountess. \"I have never seen a handsomer man.\"\n\"He is very much altered now,\" said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \"Well, as\nI was saying, Prince Vas\u00edli is the next heir through his wife, but the\ncount is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to\nthe Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death\u2014and he is\nso ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from\nPetersburg\u2014no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre",

      "text": "Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,\nbut not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they\nnow rose and took their leave. The visitor's daughter was already\nsmoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when\nsuddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls\nrunning to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl\nof thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock,\ndarted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident\nthat she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in\nthe doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer\nof the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short\njacket.\nThe count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide\nand threw them round the little girl who had run in.\n\"Ah, here she is!\" he exclaimed laughing. \"My pet, whose name day\nit is. My dear pet!\"\n\"Ma ch\u00e8re, there is a time for everything,\" said the countess with\nfeigned severity. \"You spoil her, Ily\u00e1,\" she added, turning to her\nhusband.\n\"How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name\nday,\" said the visitor. \"What a charming child,\" she added,\naddressing the mother.\nThis black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life\u2014with\nchildish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her\nbodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs\nin lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers\u2014was just at that\ncharming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not\nyet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed\nface in the lace of her mother's mantilla\u2014not paying the least\nattention to her severe remark\u2014and began to laugh. She laughed, and in\nfragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced\nfrom the folds of her frock.\n\"Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...\" was all Nat\u00e1sha\nmanaged to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against\nher mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even\nthe prim visitor could not help joining in.\n\"Now then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,\" said the\nmother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning\nto the visitor she added: \"She is my youngest girl.\"\nNat\u00e1sha, raising her face for a moment from her mother's mantilla,\nglanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.\nThe visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it\nnecessary to take some part in it.\n\"Tell me, my dear,\" said she to Nat\u00e1sha, \"is Mimi a relation of\nyours? A daughter, I suppose?\"\nNat\u00e1sha did not like the visitor's tone of condescension to childish\nthings. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.\nMeanwhile the younger generation: Bor\u00eds, the officer, Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna's son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count's eldest\nson; S\u00f3nya, the count's fifteen-year-old niece, and little P\u00e9tya,\nhis youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were\nobviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement\nand mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms,\nfrom which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had\nbeen more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the\nweather, and Countess Apr\u00e1ksina. Now and then they glanced at one\nanother, hardly able to suppress their laughter.\nThe two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood,\nwere of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Bor\u00eds\nwas tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate\nfeatures. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression.\nDark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face\nexpressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered\nthe drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but\nfailed. Bor\u00eds on the contrary at once found his footing, and related\nquietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was\nstill quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged\nduring the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked\nright across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Nat\u00e1sha.\nShe turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was\nscrewing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable\nto control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as\nfast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Bor\u00eds did not laugh.\n\"You were meaning to go out, weren't you, Mamma? Do you want the\ncarriage?\" he asked his mother with a smile.\n\"Yes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,\" she answered,\nreturning his smile.\nBor\u00eds quietly left the room and went in search of Nat\u00e1sha. The plump\nboy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been\ndisturbed.",

      "text": "The only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the\nyoung lady visitor and the countess' eldest daughter (who was four\nyears older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person),\nwere Nicholas and S\u00f3nya, the niece. S\u00f3nya was a slender little\nbrunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long\nlashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny\ntint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but\ngraceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements,\nby the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain\ncoyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown\nkitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently\nconsidered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by\nsmiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes\nwatched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate\ngirlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose\nupon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to\nspring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as\nthey too could, like Nat\u00e1sha and Bor\u00eds, escape from the drawing room.\n\"Ah yes, my dear,\" said the count, addressing the visitor and\npointing to Nicholas, \"his friend Bor\u00eds has become an officer, and\nso for friendship's sake he is leaving the university and me, his\nold father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a\nplace and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn't\nthat friendship?\" remarked the count in an inquiring tone.\n\"But they say that war has been declared,\" replied the visitor.\n\"They've been saying so a long while,\" said the count, \"and\nthey'll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My\ndear, there's friendship for you,\" he repeated. \"He's joining\nthe hussars.\"\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.\n\"It's not at all from friendship,\" declared Nicholas, flaring\nup and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. \"It is not from\nfriendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.\"\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both\nregarding him with a smile of approbation.\n\"Schubert, the colonel of the P\u00e1vlograd Hussars, is dining with us\ntoday. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him.\nIt can't be helped!\" said the count, shrugging his shoulders and\nspeaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.\n\"I have already told you, Papa,\" said his son, \"that if you\ndon't wish to let me go, I'll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere\nexcept in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.\u2014I\ndon't know how to hide what I feel.\" As he spoke he kept glancing\nwith the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at S\u00f3nya and the young\nlady visitor.\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment\nto start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.\n\"All right, all right!\" said the old count. \"He always flares up!\nThis Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he\nrose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,\" he\nadded, not noticing his visitor's sarcastic smile.\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Kar\u00e1gina turned to\nyoung Rost\u00f3v.\n\"What a pity you weren't at the Arkh\u00e1rovs' on Thursday. It was so\ndull without you,\" said she, giving him a tender smile.\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish\nsmile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation\nwithout at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart\nof S\u00f3nya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk\nhe glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and\nhardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile\non her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas' animation\nvanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then\nwith a distressed face left the room to find S\u00f3nya.\n\"How plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their\nsleeves!\" said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out.\n\"Cousinage\u2014dangereux voisinage,\" * she added.\n* Cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood.\n\"Yes,\" said the countess when the brightness these young people had\nbrought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no\none had put but which was always in her mind, \"and how much suffering,\nhow much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in\nthem now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is\nalways, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both\nfor girls and boys.\"\n\"It all depends on the bringing up,\" remarked the visitor.\n\"Yes, you're quite right,\" continued the countess. \"Till now I\nhave always, thank God, been my children's friend and had their full\nconfidence,\" said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who\nimagine that their children have no secrets from them. \"I know I shall\nalways be my daughters' first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with\nhis impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can't help it), he\nwill all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.\"\n\"Yes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,\" chimed in the count,\nwho always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding\nthat everything was splendid. \"Just fancy: wants to be an hussar.\nWhat's one to do, my dear?\"\n\"What a charming creature your younger girl is,\" said the visitor;\n\"a little volcano!\"\n\"Yes, a regular volcano,\" said the count. \"Takes after me! And\nwhat a voice she has; though she's my daughter, I tell the truth\nwhen I say she'll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an\nItalian to give her lessons.\"\n\"Isn't she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train\nit at that age.\"\n\"Oh no, not at all too young!\" replied the count. \"Why, our\nmothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.\"\n\"And she's in love with Bor\u00eds already. Just fancy!\" said the\ncountess with a gentle smile, looking at Bor\u00eds and went on, evidently\nconcerned with a thought that always occupied her: \"Now you see if I\nwere to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they\nmight be up to on the sly\" (she meant that they would be kissing),\n\"but as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to\nme of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I\nspoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I\nwas stricter.\"\n\"Yes, I was brought up quite differently,\" remarked the handsome\nelder daughter, Countess V\u00e9ra, with a smile.\nBut the smile did not enhance V\u00e9ra's beauty as smiles generally do;\non the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant,\nexpression. V\u00e9ra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at\nlearning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said\nwas true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone\u2014the visitors\nand countess alike\u2014turned to look at her as if wondering why she had\nsaid it, and they all felt awkward.\n\"People are always too clever with their eldest children and try to\nmake something exceptional of them,\" said the visitor.\n\"What's the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too\nclever with V\u00e9ra,\" said the count. \"Well, what of that? She's\nturned out splendidly all the same,\" he added, winking at V\u00e9ra.\nThe guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.",

There she paused and stood listening to the conversation\nin the drawing room, waiting for Bor\u00eds to come out. She was already\ngrowing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming\nat once, when she heard the young man's discreet steps approaching\nneither quickly nor slowly. At this Nat\u00e1sha dashed swiftly among the\nflower tubs and hid there.\nBor\u00eds paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little\ndust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined\nhis handsome face. Nat\u00e1sha, very still, peered out from her ambush,\nwaiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the\nglass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Nat\u00e1sha was about to\ncall him but changed her mind. \"Let him look for me,\" thought she.\nHardly had Bor\u00eds gone than S\u00f3nya, flushed, in tears, and muttering\nangrily, came in at the other door. Nat\u00e1sha checked her first impulse\nto run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching\u2014as\nunder an invisible cap\u2014to see what went on in the world. She was\nexperiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. S\u00f3nya, muttering to herself,\nkept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas\ncame in.\n\"S\u00f3nya, what is the matter with you? How can you?\" said he, running\nup to her.\n\"It's nothing, nothing; leave me alone!\" sobbed S\u00f3nya.\n\"Ah, I know what it is.\"\n\"Well, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!\"\n\"S\u00f3-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that,\nfor a mere fancy?\" said Nicholas taking her hand.\nS\u00f3nya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Nat\u00e1sha, not stirring\nand scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes.\n\"What will happen now?\" thought she.\n\"S\u00f3nya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are\neverything!\" said Nicholas. \"And I will prove it to you.\"\n\"I don't like you to talk like that.\"\n\"Well, then, I won't; only forgive me, S\u00f3nya!\" He drew her to him\nand kissed her.\n\"Oh, how nice,\" thought Nat\u00e1sha; and when S\u00f3nya and Nicholas had\ngone out of the conservatory she followed and called Bor\u00eds to her.",

Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what\nbesides! But don't let's talk about me; tell me how you managed\neverything. I often wonder at you, Annette\u2014how at your age you\ncan rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those\nministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It's\nquite astonishing. How did you get things settled?

I don't mind what they think of\nme.\"\n\"Well, and to whom did you apply about B\u00f3ry?\" asked the countess.\n\"You see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas\nis going as a cadet. There's no one to interest himself for him. To\nwhom did you apply?\"\n\"To Prince Vas\u00edli. He was so kind.

His position has not turned his head\nat all. He said to me, 'I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear\nPrincess. I am at your command.' Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very\nkind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do\nanything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my\nposition is now a terrible one,\" continued Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, sadly,\ndropping her voice. \"My wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no\nprogress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don't\nknow how to equip Bor\u00eds.\" She took out her handkerchief and began to\ncry. \"I need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble\nnote. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril\nVlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov. If he will not assist his godson\u2014you know\nhe is B\u00f3ry's godfather\u2014and allow him something for his maintenance,\nall my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to\nequip him.\"\nThe countess' eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.\n\"I often think, though, perhaps it's a sin,\" said the princess,\n\"that here lives Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov so rich, all\nalone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It's a\nburden to him, and B\u00f3ry's life is only just beginning....\"\n\"Surely he will leave something to Bor\u00eds,\" said the countess.\n\"Heaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish.\nStill, I will take Bor\u00eds and go to see him at once, and I shall speak\nto him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it's\nreally all the same to me when my son's fate is at stake.\" The\nprincess rose. \"It's now two o'clock and you dine at four. There\nwill just be time.\"\nAnd like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of\ntime, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the\nanteroom with him.",

This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.\n\"Then it is certain?\" said the prince.\n\"Prince, humanum est errare, * but...\" replied the doctor,\nswallowing his r's, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French\naccent.\n* To err is human.\n\"Very well, very well...\"\nSeeing Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna and her son, Prince Vas\u00edli dismissed the\ndoctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of\ninquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly\nclouded his mother's face, and he smiled slightly.\n\"Ah, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our\ndear invalid?\" said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look\nfixed on her.\nPrince Vas\u00edli stared at her and at Bor\u00eds questioningly and perplexed.\nBor\u00eds bowed politely. Prince Vas\u00edli without acknowledging the bow\nturned to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, answering her query by a movement of the\nhead and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.\n\"Is it possible?\" exclaimed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \"Oh, how awful!\nIt is terrible to think.... This is my son,\" she added, indicating\nBor\u00eds. \"He wanted to thank you himself.\"\nBor\u00eds bowed again politely.\n\"Believe me, Prince, a mother's heart will never forget what you\nhave done for us.\"\n\"I am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna,\" said Prince Vas\u00edli, arranging his lace frill, and in\ntone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna whom he had placed\nunder an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he\nhad done in Petersburg at Anna Sch\u00e9rer's reception.\n\"Try to serve well and show yourself worthy,\" added he, addressing\nBor\u00eds with severity. \"I am glad.... Are you here on leave?\" he went\non in his usual tone of indifference.\n\"I am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,\"\nreplied Bor\u00eds, betraying neither annoyance at the prince's brusque\nmanner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly\nand respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.\n\"Are you living with your mother?\"\n\"I am living at Countess Rost\u00f3va's,\" replied Bor\u00eds, again\nadding, \"your excellency.\"\n\"That is, with Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v who married Nataly Shinshin\u00e1,\" said\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna.\n\"I know, I know,\" answered Prince Vas\u00edli in his monotonous voice.\n\"I never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that\nunlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too,\nI am told.\"\n\"But a very kind man, Prince,\" said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with a\npathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rost\u00f3v deserved this\ncensure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. \"What\ndo the doctors say?\" asked the princess after a pause, her worn face\nagain expressing deep sorrow.\n\"They give little hope,\" replied the prince.\n\"And I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me\nand Bor\u00eds. He is his godson,\" she added, her tone suggesting that\nthis fact ought to give Prince Vas\u00edli much satisfaction.\nPrince Vas\u00edli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna saw that\nhe was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bez\u00fakhov's fortune,\nand hastened to reassure him.\n\"If it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,\"\nsaid she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, \"I\nknow his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with\nhim except the young princesses.... They are still young....\" She bent\nher head and continued in a whisper: \"Has he performed his final duty,\nPrince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no\nworse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill.\nWe women, Prince,\" and she smiled tenderly, \"always know how to say\nthese things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for\nme. I am used to suffering.\"\nEvidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done\nat Anna P\u00e1vlovna's, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna.\n\"Would not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna?\" said he. \"Let us wait until evening. The doctors are\nexpecting a crisis.\"\n\"But one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the\nwelfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a\nChristian...\"\nA door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the\ncount's niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her\nbody was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vas\u00edli\nturned to her.\n\"Well, how is he?\"\n\"Still the same; but what can you expect, this noise...\" said the\nprincess, looking at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna as at a stranger.\n\"Ah, my dear, I hardly knew you,\" said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with a\nhappy smile, ambling lightly up to the count's niece. \"I have come,\nand am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you\nhave gone through,\" and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.\nThe princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she\nhad conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vas\u00edli to\ntake a seat beside her.\n\"Bor\u00eds,\" she said to her son with a smile, \"I shall go in to see\nthe count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile\nand don't forget to give him the Rost\u00f3vs' invitation. They ask him\nto dinner. I suppose he won't go?\" she continued, turning to the\nprince.\n\"On the contrary,\" replied the prince, who had plainly become\ndepressed, \"I shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young\nman.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.\"",

He had now been\nfor some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father's\nhouse. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be\nalready known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father\u2014who were\nnever favorably disposed toward him\u2014would have used it to turn the\ncount against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to\nhis father's part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the\nprincesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom\nwere sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the\neldest who was reading\u2014the one who had met Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. The\ntwo younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they\ndiffered only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her\nmuch prettier.

She drew her wool down through the\ncanvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying\nto make out the pattern.\n\"How do you do, cousin?\" said Pierre. \"You don't recognize\nme?\"\n\"I recognize you only too well, too well.\"\n\"How is the count? Can I see him?\" asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual,\nbut unabashed.\n\"The count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you\nhave done your best to increase his mental sufferings.\"\n\"Can I see the count?\" Pierre again asked.\n\"Hm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see\nhim... Olga, go and see whether Uncle's beef tea is ready\u2014it is\nalmost time,\" she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were\nbusy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he,\nPierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.\nOlga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and\nsaid: \"Then I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see\nhim.\"\nAnd he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the\nsister with the mole.",

The count is very, very ill, and you must\nnot see him at all.\"\nSince then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in\nhis rooms upstairs.\nWhen Bor\u00eds appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room,\nstopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall,\nas if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely\nover his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering\nindistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.\n\"England is done for,\" said he, scowling and pointing his finger\nat someone unseen. \"Mr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the\nrights of man, is sentenced to...\" But before Pierre\u2014who at that\nmoment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just\neffected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured\nLondon\u2014could pronounce Pitt's sentence, he saw a well-built and\nhandsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left\nMoscow when Bor\u00eds was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him,\nbut in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Bor\u00eds by the hand\nwith a friendly smile.\n\"Do you remember me?\" asked Bor\u00eds quietly with a pleasant smile.\n\"I have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not\nwell.\"\n\"Yes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,\"\nanswered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.\nBor\u00eds felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider\nit necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least\nembarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.\n\"Count Rost\u00f3v asks you to come to dinner today,\" said he, after a\nconsiderable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.\n\"Ah, Count Rost\u00f3v!\" exclaimed Pierre joyfully. \"Then you are his\nson, Ily\u00e1?

Rost\u00f3v, the father, is Ily\u00e1, and his son is\nNicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.\"\nPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.\n\"Oh dear, what am I thinking about? I've mixed everything up. One\nhas so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Bor\u00eds? Of course. Well, now\nwe know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition?\nThe English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the\nChannel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve\ndoesn't make a mess of things!\"\nBor\u00eds knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the\npapers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve's name.\n\"We here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal\nthan with politics,\" said he in his quiet ironical tone. \"I know\nnothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy\nwith gossip,\" he continued. \"Just now they are talking about you and\nyour father.\"\nPierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion's\nsake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret.\nBut Bor\u00eds spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into\nPierre's eyes.\n\"Moscow has nothing else to do but gossip,\" Bor\u00eds went on.\n\"Everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune,\nthough he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...\"\n\"Yes, it is all very horrid,\" interrupted Pierre, \"very horrid.\"\nPierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say\nsomething disconcerting to himself.\n\"And it must seem to you,\" said Bor\u00eds flushing slightly, but not\nchanging his tone or attitude, \"it must seem to you that everyone is\ntrying to get something out of the rich man?\"\n\"So it does,\" thought Pierre.\n\"But I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are\nquite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are\nvery poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that\nyour father is rich, I don't regard myself as a relation of his, and\nneither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.\"\nFor a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped\nup from the sofa, seized Bor\u00eds under the elbow in his quick, clumsy\nway, and, blushing far more than Bor\u00eds, began to speak with a feeling\nof mingled shame and vexation.\n\"Well, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know\nvery well...\"\nBut Bor\u00eds again interrupted him.\n\"I am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You\nmust excuse me,\" said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put\nat ease by him, \"but I hope I have not offended you. I always make it\na rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to\ndinner at the Rost\u00f3vs'?\"\nAnd Bor\u00eds, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and\nextricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it,\nbecame quite pleasant again.\n\"No, but I say,\" said Pierre, calming down, \"you are a wonderful\nfellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you\ndon't know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we\nwere children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand.\nI could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but\nit's splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It's\nqueer,\" he added after a pause, \"that you should have suspected\nme!\" He began to laugh. \"Well, what of it! I hope we'll get better\nacquainted,\" and he pressed Bor\u00eds' hand. \"Do you know, I have not\nonce been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for\nhim as a man, but what can one do?\"\n\"And so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?\" asked\nBor\u00eds with a smile.\nPierre saw that Bor\u00eds wished to change the subject, and being of the\nsame mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the\nBoulogne expedition.\nA footman came in to summon Bor\u00eds\u2014the princess was going. Pierre, in\norder to make Bor\u00eds' better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner,\nand warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles\ninto Bor\u00eds' eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and",

The count took the gentlemen into\nhis study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From\ntime to time he went out to ask: \"Hasn't she come yet?\" They\nwere expecting M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna Akhros\u00edmova, known in society as le\nterrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for\ncommon sense and frank plainness of speech. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna was known\nto the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both\ncities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told\ngood stories about her, while none the less all without exception\nrespected and feared her.\nIn the count's room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked\nof the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the\nrecruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew\nit had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were\nsmoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head\nfirst to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident\npleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he\negged on against each other.\nOne of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled\nface, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable\nyoung man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and,\nhaving stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the\nsmoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor,\nShinsh\u00edn, a cousin of the countess', a man with \"a sharp tongue\"\nas they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to\nhis companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards,\nirreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the\nmiddle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting\nit escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an\nofficer in the Sem\u00ebnov regiment with whom Bor\u00eds was to travel to join\nthe army, and about whom Nat\u00e1sha had teased her elder sister V\u00e9ra,\nspeaking of Berg as her \"intended.\" The count sat between them and\nlistened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a\ncard game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he\nsucceeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.\n\"Well, then, old chap, mon tr\u00e8s honorable Alphonse K\u00e1rlovich,\"\nsaid Shinsh\u00edn, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian\nexpressions with the choicest French phrases\u2014which was a peculiarity\nof his speech. \"Vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l'\u00e9tat; *\nyou want to make something out of your company?\"\n* You expect to make an income out of the government.\n\"No, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich; I only want to show that in the cavalry\nthe advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own\nposition now, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich...\"\nBerg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His\nconversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm\nand silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing\non himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put\nout of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as\nsoon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk\ncircumstantially and with evident satisfaction.\n\"Consider my position, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich. Were I in the cavalry I\nshould get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even\nwith the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and\nthirty,\" said he, looking at Shinsh\u00edn and the count with a joyful,\npleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must\nalways be the chief desire of everyone else.\n\"Besides that, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich, by exchanging into the Guards\nI shall be in a more prominent position,\" continued Berg, \"and\nvacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think\nwhat can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to\nput a little aside and to send something to my father,\" he went on,\nemitting a smoke ring.\n\"La balance y est... * A German knows how to skin a flint, as the\nproverb says,\" remarked Shinsh\u00edn, moving his pipe to the other side\nof his mouth and winking at the count.\n* So that squares matters.\nThe count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinsh\u00edn\nwas talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference,\ncontinued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already\ngained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime\nthe company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company,\nmight easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in\nthe regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently\nenjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others,\ntoo, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily\nsedate, and the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that\nhe disarmed his hearers.\n\"Well, my boy, you'll get along wherever you go\u2014foot or\nhorse\u2014that I'll warrant,\" said Shinsh\u00edn, patting him on the\nshoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.\nBerg smiled joyously.

      "text": "It was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests,\nexpecting the summons to zak\u00faska, * avoid engaging in any long\nconversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order\nto show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and\nhostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another,\nand the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are\nwaiting for\u2014some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish\nthat is not yet ready.\n* Hors d'oeuvres.\nPierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the\nmiddle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across,\nblocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk,\nbut he went on na\u00efvely looking around through his spectacles as if in\nsearch of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He\nwas in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of\nthe guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity\nat this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest\nfellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.\n\"You have only lately arrived?\" the countess asked him.\n\"Oui, madame,\" replied he, looking around him.\n\"You have not yet seen my husband?\"\n\"Non, madame.\" He smiled quite inappropriately.\n\"You have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it's very\ninteresting.\"\n\"Very interesting.\"\nThe countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. The latter\nunderstood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and\nsitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he\nanswered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other\nguests were all conversing with one another. \"The Razum\u00f3vskis... It\nwas charming... You are very kind... Countess Apr\u00e1ksina...\" was heard\non all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.\n\"M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna?\" came her voice from there.\n\"Herself,\" came the answer in a rough voice, and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\nentered the room.\nAll the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very\noldest rose. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout,\nholding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood\nsurveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if\nrolling them up. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna always spoke in Russian.\n\"Health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her\nchildren,\" she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all\nothers. \"Well, you old sinner,\" she went on, turning to the count\nwho was kissing her hand, \"you're feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay?\nNowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just\nsee how these nestlings are growing up,\" and she pointed to the girls.\n\"You must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....\"\n\"Well,\" said she, \"how's my Cossack?\" (M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\nalways called Nat\u00e1sha a Cossack) and she stroked the child's arm as\nshe came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. \"I know she's a scamp\nof a girl, but I like her.\"\nShe took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and,\nhaving given them to the rosy Nat\u00e1sha, who beamed with the pleasure\nof her saint's-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to\nPierre.\n\"Eh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,\" said she, assuming a soft high\ntone of voice. \"Come here, my friend...\" and she ominously tucked\nup her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a\nchildlike way through his spectacles.\n\"Come nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell\nyour father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it's my\nevident duty.\" She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to\nfollow, for this was clearly only a prelude.\n\"A fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed\nand he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame,\nsir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.\"\nShe turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep\nfrom laughing.\n\"Well, I suppose it is time we were at table?\" said M\u00e1rya\nDm\u00edtrievna.\nThe count went in first with M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, the countess followed\non the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because\nNicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\nwith Shinsh\u00edn. Berg gave his arm to V\u00e9ra. The smiling Julie Kar\u00e1gina\nwent in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the\nwhole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses\nfollowed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the\nband struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their\nplaces. Then the strains of the count's household band were replaced\nby the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the\nsoft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna on her right and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna on her left, the\nother lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count,\nwith the hussar colonel on his left and Shinsh\u00edn and the other male\nvisitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the\ngrown-up young people: V\u00e9ra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Bor\u00eds; and\non the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind\nthe crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his\nwife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled\nhis neighbors' glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn,\nwithout omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from\nbehind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed\nby their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the\nladies' end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the\nmen's end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the\ncolonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so\nmuch that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg\nwith tender smiles was saying to V\u00e9ra that love is not an earthly but\na heavenly feeling. Bor\u00eds was telling his new friend Pierre who the\nguests were and exchanging glances with Nat\u00e1sha, who was sitting\nopposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a\ngreat deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and\nwent on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines.\nThese latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a\nnapkin, from behind the next man's shoulders and whispered: \"Dry\nMadeira\"... \"Hungarian\"... or \"Rhine wine\" as the case might\nbe. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count's monogram\nthat stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank\nwith enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other\nguests. Nat\u00e1sha, who sat opposite, was looking at Bor\u00eds as girls of\nthirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for\nthe first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny\nlively little girl's look made him inclined to laugh without knowing\nwhy.\nNicholas sat at some distance from S\u00f3nya, beside Julie Kar\u00e1gina, to\nwhom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. S\u00f3nya wore\na company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned\npale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas\nand Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round\nuneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the\nchildren. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines,\nand kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner\nto his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler\nwith a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to\nappear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because\nno one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from\ngreediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for\nknowledge.",

      "text": "In the midst of the third \u00e9cossaise there was a clatter of chairs being\npushed back in the sitting room where the count and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\nhad been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and\nolder visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long,\nand replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First\ncame M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The\ncount, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his\nbent arm to M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair\ngallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the\n\u00e9cossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted\nup to their gallery, addressing the first violin:\n\"Sem\u00ebn! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?\"\nThis was the count's favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth.\n(Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)\n\"Look at Papa!\" shouted Nat\u00e1sha to the whole company, and quite\nforgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her\ncurly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.\nAnd indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the\njovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner,\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his\nshoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by\na smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the\nonlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay\nstrains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant\ndance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly\nfilled by the domestic serfs\u2014the men on one side and the women on\nthe other\u2014who with beaming faces had come to see their master making\nmerry.\n\"Just look at the master! A regular eagle he is!\" loudly remarked\nthe nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.\nThe count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not\nwant to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms\nhanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her\nstern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed\nby the whole of the count's plump figure, in M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna found\nexpression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose.\nBut if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed\nthe spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and\nthe agility with which he capered about on his light feet, M\u00e1rya\nDm\u00edtrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions\u2014the least\neffort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp\nher foot\u2014which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual\nseverity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could\nnot attract a moment's attention to their own evolutions and did not\neven try to do so.

In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved\nand shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster;\nlightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying\nround M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until,\nturning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas,\nraising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling\nand making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and\nlaughter led by Nat\u00e1sha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily\nand wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.\n\"That's how we used to dance in our time, ma ch\u00e8re,\" said the\ncount.\n\"That was a Daniel Cooper!\" exclaimed M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, tucking up\nher sleeves and puffing heavily.",

      "text": "Meanwhile Prince Vas\u00edli had opened the door into the princess' room.\nIn this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before\nthe icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles.\nThe room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots,\ncupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was\njust visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.\n\"Ah, is it you, cousin?\"\nShe rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth\nthat it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with\nvarnish.\n\"Has anything happened?\" she asked. \"I am so terrified.\"\n\"No, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business,\nCatiche,\" * muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair\nshe had just vacated. \"You have made the place warm, I must say,\" he\nremarked. \"Well, sit down: let's have a talk.\"\n*Catherine.\n\"I thought perhaps something had happened,\" she said with her\nunchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the\nprince, she prepared to listen.\n\"I wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can't.\"\n\"Well, my dear?\" said Prince Vas\u00edli, taking her hand and bending it\ndownwards as was his habit.\nIt was plain that this \"well?\" referred to much that they both\nunderstood without naming.\nThe princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her\nlegs, looked directly at Prince Vas\u00edli with no sign of emotion in her\nprominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons\nwith a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow\nand devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince\nVas\u00edli understood it as an expression of weariness.\n\"And I?\" he said; \"do you think it is easier for me? I am as worn\nout as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a\nvery serious talk.\"\nPrince Vas\u00edli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously,\nnow on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant\nexpression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes\ntoo seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the\nnext glanced round in alarm.\nThe princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony\nhands, looked attentively into Prince Vas\u00edli's eyes evidently\nresolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till\nmorning.\n\"Well, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Sem\u00ebnovna,\"\ncontinued Prince Vas\u00edli, returning to his theme, apparently not\nwithout an inner struggle; \"at such a moment as this one must think\nof everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you\nall, like children of my own, as you know.\"\nThe princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same\ndull expression.\n\"And then of course my family has also to be considered,\" Prince\nVas\u00edli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at\nher. \"You know, Catiche, that we\u2014you three sisters, M\u00e1montov, and\nmy wife\u2014are the count's only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard\nit is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for\nme; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for\nanything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,\" pointing to\nhis portrait, \"definitely demanded that he should be called.\"\nPrince Vas\u00edli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make\nout whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was\nsimply looking at him.\n\"There is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,\" she\nreplied, \"and it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow\nhis noble soul peacefully to leave this...\"\n\"Yes, yes, of course,\" interrupted Prince Vas\u00edli impatiently,\nrubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little\ntable that he had pushed away. \"But... in short, the fact is... you\nknow yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left\nall his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.\"\n\"He has made wills enough!\" quietly remarked the princess. \"But he\ncannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.\"\n\"But, my dear,\" said Prince Vas\u00edli suddenly, clutching the little\ntable and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: \"what if\na letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for\nPierre's legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the\ncount's services, his request would be granted?...\"\nThe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the\nsubject under discussion than those they are talking with.\n\"I can tell you more,\" continued Prince Vas\u00edli, seizing her hand,\n\"that letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew\nof it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then\nas soon as all is over,\" and Prince Vas\u00edli sighed to intimate what he\nmeant by the words all is over, \"and the count's papers are opened,\nthe will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition\nwill certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate\nson.\"\n\"And our share?\" asked the princess smiling ironically, as if\nanything might happen, only not that.\n\"But, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the\nlegal heir to everything and you won't get anything. You must know,\nmy dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have\nbeen destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you\nought to know where they are, and must find them, because...\"\n\"What next?\" the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not\nchanging the expression of her eyes. \"I am a woman, and you think we\nare all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit...\nun b\u00e2tard!\"* she added, as if supposing that this translation of the\nword would effectively prove to Prince Vas\u00edli the invalidity of his\ncontention.\n* A bastard.\n\"Well, really, Catiche! Can't you understand! You are so\nintelligent, how is it you don't see that if the count has written a\nletter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it\nfollows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bez\u00fakhov,\nand will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and\nletter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation\nof having been dutiful et tout ce qui s'ensuit!* That's certain.\"\n* And all that follows therefrom.\n\"I know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid;\nand you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,\" said the\nprincess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are\nsaying something witty and stinging.\n\"My dear Princess Catherine Sem\u00ebnovna,\" began Prince Vas\u00edli\nimpatiently, \"I came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about\nyour interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I\ntell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the\nwill in Pierre's favor are among the count's papers, then, my dear\ngirl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don't believe me,\nthen believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dm\u00edtri On\u00fafrich\"\n(the family solicitor) \"and he says the same.\"\nAt this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess' ideas;\nher thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice\nwhen she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself\nevidently did not expect.\n\"That would be a fine thing!\" said she. \"I never wanted anything\nand I don't now.\"\nShe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.\n\"And this is gratitude\u2014this is recognition for those who have\nsacrificed everything for his sake!\" she cried. \"It's splendid!\nFine! I don't want anything, Prince.\"\n\"Yes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...\"\nreplied Prince Vas\u00edli.\nBut the princess did not listen to him.\n\"Yes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect\nnothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude\u2014the\nblackest ingratitude\u2014in this house...\"\n\"Do you or do you not know where that will is?\" insisted Prince\nVas\u00edli, his cheeks twitching more than ever.\n\"Yes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and\nsacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has\nbeen intriguing!\"\nThe princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She\nhad the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race.\nShe gave her companion an angry glance.\n\"There is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was\nall done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards\nforgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his\nlast moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let\nhim die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...\"\n\"Who sacrificed everything for him,\" chimed in the princess, who\nwould again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, \"though\nhe never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,\" she added with a sigh,\n\"I shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward,\nthat in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one\nhas to be cunning and cruel.\"\n\"Now come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.\"\n\"No, I have a wicked heart.\"\n\"I know your heart,\" repeated the prince. \"I value your friendship\nand wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don't upset yourself,\nand let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it\nbut an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where\nit is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the\ncount. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it.\nYou understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his\nwishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him\nand you.\"\n\"Now I see it all! I know who has been intriguing\u2014I know!\" cried\nthe princess.\n\"That's not the point, my dear.\"\n\"It's that prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetsk\u00e1ya,\nthat Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the\ninfamous, vile woman!\"\n\"Do not let us lose any time...\"\n\"Ah, don't talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and\ntold the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about\nSophie\u2014I can't repeat them\u2014that it made the count quite ill and he\nwould not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this\nvile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.\"\n\"We've got to it at last\u2014why did you not tell me about it\nsooner?\"\n\"It's in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,\"\nsaid the princess, ignoring his question. \"Now I know! Yes; if I have\na sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!\" almost shrieked\nthe princess, now quite changed. \"And what does she come worming\nherself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time\nwill come!\"",

From the passage they went into a large, dimly\nlit room adjoining the count's reception room. It was one of those\nsumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front\napproach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water\nhad been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer\nand by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They\nwent into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian\nwindows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full\nlength portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still\nsitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one\nanother. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who,\nhanging his head, meekly followed her.\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna's face expressed a consciousness that the decisive\nmoment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now,\nkeeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than\nthat afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the\ndying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid\nglance at all those in the room and noticing the count's confessor\nthere, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet\nseeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing\nfirst of one and then of another priest.\n\"God be thanked that you are in time,\" said she to one of the\npriests; \"all we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young\nman is the count's son,\" she added more softly. \"What a terrible\nmoment!\"\nHaving said this she went up to the doctor.\n\"Dear doctor,\" said she, \"this young man is the count's son. Is\nthere any hope?\"\nThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his\nshoulders. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with just the same movement raised her\nshoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away\nfrom the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and\ntenderly sad voice, she said:\n\"Trust in His mercy!\" and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit\nand wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was\nwatching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.\nPierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved\ntoward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna had\ndisappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him\nwith something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they\nwhispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind\nof awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before\nreceived was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to\nthe priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up\nand returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully\nsilent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre\nwished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to\npick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not\neven in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and\nthat tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful\nrite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound\nto accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the\naide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady's chair, placing his huge hands\nsymmetrically on his knees in the na\u00efve attitude of an Egyptian statue,\nand decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in\norder not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his\nown ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of\nthose who were guiding him.",

Under\nthe gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair\non snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre\nsaw\u2014covered to the waist by a bright green quilt\u2014the familiar,\nmajestic figure of his father, Count Bez\u00fakhov, with that gray mane of\nhair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep\ncharacteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay\njust under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the\nright hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust\nbetween forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from\nbehind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests,\ntheir long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments,\nwith lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the\nservice. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding\nhandkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest\nsister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on\nthe icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for\nherself should she glance round. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, with a meek,\nsorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door\nnear the strange lady. Prince Vas\u00edli in front of the door, near the\ninvalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on\nthe carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose,\nand was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward\neach time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety\nand resignation to the will of God. \"If you do not understand these\nsentiments,\" he seemed to be saying, \"so much the worse for you!\"\nBehind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants;\nthe men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing\nthemselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting\nof deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of\nfeet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, with\nan air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she\nwas about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave\nhim a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him,\nbegan crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.\nSophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole,\nwatched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained\nwith it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she\nagain began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him\nwithout laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of\ntemptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst\nof the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered\nto one another, and the old servant who was holding the count's hand\ngot up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna stepped\nforward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from\nbehind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning\nagainst one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he,\na foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full\nimportance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He\nnow approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor\nof life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the\nhand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected\na moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a\nstir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service\ncontinued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vas\u00edli\nleft the chair on which he had been leaning, and\u2014with an air\nwhich intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not\nunderstand him it was so much the worse for them\u2014did not go up to the\ndying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved\nwith her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its\nsilken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vas\u00edli and the princess\npassed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the\nother before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention\nto this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his\nmind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was\nin some way essential.\nThe chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was\nheard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the\nsacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around\nhim everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna's was the most distinct.\nPierre heard her say:\n\"Certainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be\nimpossible...\"\nThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants\nthat Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray\nmane\u2014which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight\nof for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the\ncautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that\nthey had lifted the dying man and were moving him.\n\"Catch hold of my arm or you'll drop him!\" he heard one of the\nservants say in a frightened whisper. \"Catch hold from underneath.\nHere!\" exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the\nbearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the\nweight they were carrying were too much for them.\nAs the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, passed the young man\nhe caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying\nman's high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by\nthose who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly,\nleonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones,\nits handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was\nnot disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre\nremembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to\nPetersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven\nmovements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon\nnothing.\nAfter a few minutes' bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had\ncarried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna touched Pierre's\nhand and said, \"Come.\" Pierre went with her to the bed on which the\nsick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony\njust completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His\nhands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms\ndownward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but\nwith a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal\nman. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes\nthey must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated,\nnot knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick\nman's hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre,\ncarefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her\nsuggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither\nthe hand nor a single muscle of the count's face stirred. Once more\nPierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna to see what he was to\ndo next. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood\nbeside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were\ndoing right. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell\ninto the na\u00efvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently\ndistressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing\nhis utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who\nstill gazed at the spot where Pierre's face had been before he sat\ndown. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of\nthe pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the\nfather and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an\nhour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count's face began\nto twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one\nside (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and\nfrom that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna looked attentively at the sick man's eyes, trying to\nguess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink,\nthen named Prince Vas\u00edli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the\nquilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an\neffort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the\nbed.\n\"Wants to turn on the other side,\" whispered the servant, and got up\nto turn the count's heavy body toward the wall.\nPierre rose to help him.\nWhile the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back\nhelplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he\nnoticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm,\nor whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any\nrate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre's terror-stricken\nface, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile\nappeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride\nhis own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected\nquivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his\neyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall.\nHe sighed.\n\"He is dozing,\" said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, observing that one of the\nprincesses was coming to take her turn at watching. \"Let us go.\"\nPierre went out.",

Around the table all who were at Count\nBez\u00fakhov's house that night had gathered to fortify themselves.\nPierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors\nand little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not\nknow how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies\nwho, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and\npearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly\nlighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now\nthis same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea\nthings and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the\nnight a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly\nwhispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none\nof them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the\nbedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have\nliked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was\nagain going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince\nVas\u00edli and the eldest princess.

Their efforts in the struggle for the\nportfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if\nthe princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna\nMikh\u00e1ylovna.

General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andr\u00e9evich\n(nicknamed in society, \"the King of Prussia\") ever since the Emperor\nPaul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously\nwith his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle\nBourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the\ncapitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that\nanyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to\nBald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to\nsay that there are only two sources of human vice\u2014idleness and\nsuperstition, and only two virtues\u2014activity and intelligence. He\nhimself undertook his daughter's education, and to develop these two\ncardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry\ntill she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was\noccupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving\nproblems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working\nin the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on\nat his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity,\nregularity in his household was carried to the highest point of\nexactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions,\nand not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about\nhim, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably\nexacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear\nand respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was\nin retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high\nofficial appointed to the province in which the prince's estate lay\nconsidered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber\njust as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince\nappeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this\nantechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when\nthe enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather\nsmall old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray\neyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd,\nyouthfully glittering eyes.",

Every morning she came in like that, and every morning\nprayed that the daily interview might pass off well.\nAn old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose\nquietly and said in a whisper: \"Please walk in.\"\nThrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly\nopened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the\nentrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round\ncontinued his work.\nThe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use.\nThe large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted\nbookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while\nstanding up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with\ntools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around\u2014all indicated\ncontinuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot\nshod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure\nof the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the\ntenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns\nof the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel,\ndropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching\nthe table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing,\nso he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding\nher tenderly and attentively, said severely:\n\"Quite well? All right then, sit down.\" He took the exercise book\ncontaining lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair\nwith his foot.\n\"For tomorrow!\" said he, quickly finding the page and making a\nscratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.\nThe princess bent over the exercise book on the table.\n\"Wait a bit, here's a letter for you,\" said the old man suddenly,\ntaking a letter addressed in a woman's hand from a bag hanging above\nthe table, onto which he threw it.\nAt the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the\nprincess' face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.\n\"From H\u00e9lo\u00efse?\" asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his\nstill sound, yellowish teeth.\n\"Yes, it's from Julie,\" replied the princess with a timid glance\nand a timid smile.\n\"I'll let two more letters pass, but the third I'll read,\" said\nthe prince sternly; \"I'm afraid you write much nonsense. I'll read\nthe third!\"\n\"Read this if you like, Father,\" said the princess, blushing still\nmore and holding out the letter.\n\"The third, I said the third!\" cried the prince abruptly, pushing\nthe letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him\nthe exercise book containing geometrical figures.\n\"Well, madam,\" he began, stooping over the book close to his\ndaughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat,\nso that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of\nold age and tobacco, which she had known so long. \"Now, madam, these\ntriangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...\"\nThe princess looked in a scared way at her father's eyes glittering\nclose to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was\nplain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her\nfear would prevent her understanding any of her father's further\nexplanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the\nteacher's fault or the pupil's, this same thing happened every day:\nthe princess' eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear\nanything, but was only conscious of her stern father's withered face\nclose to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only\nof how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in\npeace.

Why cannot I now, as\nthree months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle,\ncalm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me\nas I write?\nHaving read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror\nwhich stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and\nthin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness\nat her reflection in the glass. \"She flatters me,\" thought the\nprincess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter\nher friend, the princess' eyes\u2014large, deep and luminous (it seemed\nas if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)\u2014were\nso beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face\nthey gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the\nprincess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes\u2014the look\nthey had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her\nface assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a\nglass. She went on reading:\nAll Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already\nabroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march\nto the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought\nintends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant\nthat the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may\nbe overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His\ngoodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this\nwar has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean\nyoung Nicholas Rost\u00f3v, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain\ninactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to\nyou, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for\nthe army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you\nlast summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which\none seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly,\nhe is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that\nmy relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the\nsweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much.\nSomeday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then.\nThat is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know\nthese poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are\ngenerally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too\nyoung ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship,\nthis poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of\nthis! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of\nold Count Bez\u00fakhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses\nhave received very little, Prince Vas\u00edli nothing, and it is Monsieur\nPierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been\nrecognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bez\u00fakhov and\npossessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince\nVas\u00edli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he\nreturned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.\nI confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and\ninheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used\nto know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bez\u00fakhov and the\nowner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to\nwatch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by\nmarriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward\nhim, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort\nof fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves\nby finding husbands for me (most of whom I don't even know), the\nmatchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess\nBez\u00fakhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post.\n\u00c0 propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal\nauntie Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of\na plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince\nVas\u00edli's son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to\nsomeone rich and distingu\u00e9e, and it is on you that his relations'\nchoice has fallen. I don't know what you will think of it, but\nI consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very\nhandsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find\nout about him.\nBut enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and\nMamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apr\u00e1ksins'. Read the\nmystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though\nthere are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it\nis an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give\nmy respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle\nBourienne. I embrace you as I love you.\nJULIE",

      "text": "P.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.\nThe princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous\neyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly\nrose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of\npaper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote,\nalso in French:\nDear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great\ndelight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which\nyou say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect\non you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I\ndared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if\nwe had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you\nsuppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young\nman? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such\nfeelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of\nthem, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian\nlove, love of one's neighbor, love of one's enemy, is worthier,\nsweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a\nyoung man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.\nThe news of Count Bez\u00fakhov's death reached us before your letter\nand my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last\nrepresentative but one of the great century, and that it is his own\nturn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as\npossible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!\nI cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always\nseemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value\nmost in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince\nVas\u00edli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine\nSaviour's words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the\neye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are\nterribly true. I pity Prince Vas\u00edli but am still more sorry for Pierre.\nSo young, and burdened with such riches\u2014to what temptations he will be\nexposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be\npoorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the\nvolume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since\nyou tell me that among some good things it contains others which our\nweak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to\nspend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear\nno fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for\nconfusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken\ntheir doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for\nexaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read\nthe Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries\nthey contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the\nterrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh\nwhich forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us\nrather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our\ndivine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to\nconform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less\nwe let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who\nrejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek\nto fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will\nHe vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.\nMy father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he\nhas received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vas\u00edli. In\nregard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet\nfriend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must\nconform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay\nthe duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as\nfaithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings\ntoward him whom He may give me for husband.\nI have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival\nat Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one,\nhowever, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war\ninto which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you\nare\u2014at the heart of affairs and of the world\u2014is the talk all of\nwar, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature\u2014which townsfolk\nconsider characteristic of the country\u2014rumors of war are heard\nand painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and\ncountermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day\nbefore yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a\nheartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our\npeople and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of\nthe mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should\nhave heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the\nlaws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of\ninjuries\u2014and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing\none another.\nAdieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy\nMother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!\nMARY",

I must\nlet her know.\"\n\"No, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,\" said\nthe little princess, kissing her. \"I know you already through my\nsister-in-law's friendship for you.

Prince Andrew stopped and\nmade a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.\nThe little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the\nmiddle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary's heavy tread and the\nsound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who\nhad only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in\neach other's arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they\nhappened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her\nhand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to\ncry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as\nlovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go\nof one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each\nother's hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began\nkissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew's surprise\nboth began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to\ncry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women\nit seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never\nentered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.",

      "text": "When the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old\nprince to get up, T\u00edkhon came to call the young prince to his father.\nThe old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his\nson's arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while\nhe dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned\nstyle, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew\nentered his father's dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and\nmanner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which\nhe talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered\nchair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to T\u00edkhon.\n\"Ah! here's the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?\" said the\nold man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which T\u00edkhon\nwas holding fast to plait, would allow.\n\"You at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like\nthis he'll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?\" And he\nheld out his cheek.\nThe old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He\nused to say that a nap \"after dinner was silver\u2014before dinner,\ngolden.\") He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his\nthick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on\nthe spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father's favorite\ntopic\u2014making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly\nof Bonaparte.\n\"Yes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is\npregnant,\" said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his\nfather's face with an eager and respectful look. \"How is your\nhealth?\"\n\"Only fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from\nmorning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.\"\n\"Thank God,\" said his son smiling.\n\"God has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,\" he continued,\nreturning to his hobby; \"tell me how the Germans have taught you to\nfight Bonaparte by this new science you call 'strategy.'\"\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n\"Give me time to collect my wits, Father,\" said he, with a smile\nthat showed that his father's foibles did not prevent his son from\nloving and honoring him. \"Why, I have not yet had time to settle\ndown!\"\n\"Nonsense, nonsense!\" cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to\nsee whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. \"The\nhouse for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and\nshow her over, and they'll talk nineteen to the dozen. That's\ntheir woman's way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About\nMikhelson's army I understand\u2014Tolst\u00f3y's too... a simultaneous\nexpedition.... But what's the southern army to do? Prussia is\nneutral... I know that. What about Austria?\" said he, rising from his\nchair and pacing up and down the room followed by T\u00edkhon, who ran after\nhim, handing him different articles of clothing. \"What of Sweden? How\nwill they cross Pomerania?\"\nPrince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began\u2014at first\nreluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit\nchanging unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on\u2014to explain\nthe plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army,\nninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out\nof her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was\nto join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty\nthousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in\nItaly and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English\nwere to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand\nmen was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did\nnot evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were\nnot listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three\ntimes unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: \"The\nwhite one, the white one!\"\nThis meant that T\u00edkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted.\nAnother time he interrupted, saying:\n\"And will she soon be confined?\" and shaking his head reproachfully\nsaid: \"That's bad! Go on, go on.\"\nThe third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his\ndescription. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age:\n\"Malbrook s'en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.\" *\n* \"Marlborough is going to the wars; God knows when he'll\nreturn.\"\nHis son only smiled.\n\"I don't say it's a plan I approve of,\" said the son; \"I am\nonly telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now,\nnot worse than this one.\"\n\"Well, you've told me nothing new,\" and the old man repeated,\nmeditatively and rapidly:",

      "last_line": 145,
      "text": "At the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the\ndining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle\nBourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by\na strange caprice of his employer's was admitted to table though the\nposition of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly\nnot have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept\nvery strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important\ngovernment officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael\nIv\u00e1novich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his\nchecked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals,\nand had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Iv\u00e1novich\nwas \"not a whit worse than you or I.\" At dinner the prince usually\nspoke to the taciturn Michael Iv\u00e1novich more often than to anyone else.\nIn the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was\nexceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen\u2014one\nbehind each chair\u2014stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head\nbutler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making\nsigns to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door\nby which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large\ngilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes\nBolk\u00f3nski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted\nportrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate)\nof a ruling prince, in a crown\u2014an alleged descendant of R\u00farik and\nancestor of the Bolk\u00f3nskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that\ngenealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at\na portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.\n\"How thoroughly like him that is!\" he said to Princess Mary, who had\ncome up to him.\nPrincess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand\nwhat he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with\nreverence and was beyond question.\n\"Everyone has his Achilles' heel,\" continued Prince Andrew.\n\"Fancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!\"\nPrincess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother's\ncriticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard\ncoming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was\nhis wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners\nwith the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock\nstruck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing\nroom. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under\ntheir thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on\nthe little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the\nsensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around\nhim. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of\nher neck.\n\"I'm glad, glad, to see you,\" he said, looking attentively into\nher eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. \"Sit down,\nsit down! Sit down, Michael Iv\u00e1novich!\"\nHe indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved\nthe chair for her.\n\"Ho, ho!\" said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure.\n\"You've been in a hurry. That's bad!\"\nHe laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only\nand not with his eyes.\n\"You must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,\" he\nsaid.\nThe little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was\nsilent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and\nshe began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and\nshe became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings\nfrom various people and retelling the town gossip.\n\"Countess Apr\u00e1ksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has\ncried her eyes out,\" she said, growing more and more lively.\nAs she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly,\nand suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a\ndefinite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Iv\u00e1novich.\n\"Well, Michael Iv\u00e1novich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time\nof it. Prince Andrew\" (he always spoke thus of his son) \"has been\ntelling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I\nnever thought much of him.\"\nMichael Iv\u00e1novich did not at all know when \"you and I\" had said\nsuch things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as\na peg on which to hang the prince's favorite topic, he looked\ninquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.\n\"He is a great tactician!\" said the prince to his son, pointing to\nthe architect.\nAnd the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the\ngenerals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not\nonly that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the\nA B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant\nlittle Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any\nPot\u00ebmkins or Suv\u00f3rovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced\nthat there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war,\nbut only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing,\npretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his\nfather's ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him\nwith evident pleasure.\n\"The past always seems good,\" said he, \"but did not Suv\u00f3rov\nhimself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know\nhow to escape?\"\n\"Who told you that? Who?\" cried the prince. \"Suv\u00f3rov!\" And he\njerked away his plate, which T\u00edkhon briskly caught. \"Suv\u00f3rov!...\nConsider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suv\u00f3rov; Moreau!...\nMoreau would have been a prisoner if Suv\u00f3rov had had a free hand; but\nhe had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have\npuzzled the devil himself! When you get there you'll find out what\nthose Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suv\u00f3rov couldn't manage them so\nwhat chance has Michael Kut\u00fazov? No, my dear boy,\" he continued,\n\"you and your generals won't get on against Buonaparte; you'll\nhave to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight\ntogether. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to\nfetch the Frenchman, Moreau,\" he said, alluding to the invitation made\nthat year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... \"Wonderful!...\nWere the Pot\u00ebmkins, Suv\u00f3rovs, and Orl\u00f3vs Germans? No, lad, either you\nfellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help\nyou, but we'll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great\ncommander among them! Hm!...\"\n\"I don't at all say that all the plans are good,\" said Prince\nAndrew, \"I am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You\nmay laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great\ngeneral!\"\n\"Michael Iv\u00e1novich!\" cried the old prince to the architect who,\nbusy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: \"Didn't\nI tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same\nthing.\"\n\"To be sure, your excellency,\" replied the architect.\nThe prince again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\"Buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got\nsplendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only\nidlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody\nhas beaten the Germans. They beat no one\u2014except one another. He made\nhis reputation fighting them.\"\nAnd the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to\nhim, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His\nson made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were\npresented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He\nlistened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this\nold man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and\ndiscuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and\npolitical events.\n\"You think I'm an old man and don't understand the present state\nof affairs?\" concluded his father. \"But it troubles me. I don't\nsleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown\nhis skill?\" he concluded.\n\"That would take too long to tell,\" answered the son.\n\"Well, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne,\nhere's another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,\" he\nexclaimed in excellent French.\n\"You know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!\"\n\"Dieu sait quand reviendra.\" hummed the prince out of tune and, with\na laugh still more so, he quitted the table.\nThe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of\nthe dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her\nfather-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she\ntook her sister-in-law's arm and drew her into another room.",

      "text": "expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.\n\"I hear you have given orders to harness,\" she cried, panting (she\nhad apparently been running), \"and I did so wish to have another talk\nwith you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not\nangry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andr\u00fasha,\" she added,\nas if to explain such a question.\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, \"Andr\u00fasha.\" It was\nobviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be\nAndr\u00fasha\u2014the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in\nchildhood.\n\"And where is Lise?\" he asked, answering her question only by a\nsmile.\n\"She was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room.\nOh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,\" said she, sitting\ndown on the sofa, facing her brother. \"She is quite a child: such a\ndear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.\"\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and\ncontemptuous look that showed itself on his face.\n\"One must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them,\nAndrew? Don't forget that she has grown up and been educated in\nsociety, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into\neveryone's situation. Tout comprendre, c'est tout pardonner. * Think\nwhat it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to,\nto be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her\ncondition! It's very hard.\"\n* To understand all is to forgive all.\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we\nthink we thoroughly understand.\n\"You live in the country and don't think the life terrible,\" he\nreplied.\n\"I... that's different. Why speak of me? I don't want any other\nlife, and can't, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young\nsociety woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her\nlife, all alone\u2014for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what\npoor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society.\nThere is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....\"\n\"I don't like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,\" said Prince\nAndrew.\n\"No? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she's much to be\npitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don't need her,\nand she's even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am\neven more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and\nMichael Iv\u00e1novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and\nkind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says:\n'We don't love people so much for the good they have done us, as\nfor the good we have done them.' Father took her when she was homeless\nafter losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father\nlikes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads\nsplendidly.\"\n\"To be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father's character sometimes\nmakes things trying for you, doesn't it?\" Prince Andrew asked\nsuddenly.\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.\n\"For me? For me?... Trying for me!...\" said she.\n\"He always was rather harsh; and now I should think he's getting\nvery trying,\" said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their\nfather in order to puzzle or test his sister.\n\"You are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of\nintellectual pride,\" said the princess, following the train of her own\nthoughts rather than the trend of the conversation\u2014\"and that's a\ngreat sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling\nexcept veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so\ncontented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I\nam.\"\nHer brother shook his head incredulously.\n\"The only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth,\nAndrew... is Father's way of treating religious subjects. I don't\nunderstand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is\nas clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing\nthat makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of\nimprovement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a\nmonk he received and had a long talk with.\"\n\"Ah! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your\npowder,\" said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.\n\"Ah! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me.\nAndrew...\" she said timidly after a moment's silence, \"I have a\ngreat favor to ask of you.\"\n\"What is it, dear?\"\n\"No\u2014promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble\nand is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise,\nAndr\u00fasha!...\" said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet\ntaking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were\nthe subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was\ngranted.\nShe looked timidly at her brother.\n\"Even if it were a great deal of trouble...\" answered Prince Andrew,\nas if guessing what it was about.\n\"Think what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as\nyou please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father's father, our\ngrandfather, wore it in all his wars.\" (She still did not take out\nwhat she was holding in her reticule.) \"So you promise?\"\n\"Of course. What is it?\"\n\"Andrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will\nnever take it off. Do you promise?\"\n\"If it does not weigh a hundredweight and won't break my neck...\nTo please you...\" said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing\nthe pained expression his joke had brought to his sister's face, he\nrepented and added: \"I am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.\"\n\"Against your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you\nto Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,\" said she in a voice\ntrembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her\nbrother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold\nsetting, on a finely wrought silver chain.\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.\n\"Please, Andrew, for my sake!...\"\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit\nup the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother\nwould have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood,\ncrossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for\nhe was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.",

      "text": "\"Thank you, my dear.\" She kissed him on the forehead and sat down\nagain on the sofa. They were silent for a while.\n\"As I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always\nused to be. Don't judge Lise harshly,\" she began. \"She is so\nsweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.\"\n\"I do not think I have complained of my wife to you, M\u00e1sha, or blamed\nher. Why do you say all this to me?\"\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary's face and she was silent as if\nshe felt guilty.\n\"I have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And\nI am sorry for that,\" he went on.\nThe patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to\nsay something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little\nprincess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings\nabout her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her\nfate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen\nasleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.\n\"Know this, M\u00e1sha: I can't reproach, have not reproached, and never\nshall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself\nwith anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever\ncircumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if\nyou want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this\nis so I don't know...\"\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed\nher forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and\nunaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over\nher head toward the darkness of the open doorway.\n\"Let us go to her, I must say good-by. Or\u2014go and wake and I'll\ncome in a moment. Petr\u00fashka!\" he called to his valet: \"Come here,\ntake these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.\"\nPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said:\n\"Andrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him\nto give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been\nanswered.\"\n\"Well, maybe!\" said Prince Andrew. \"Go, M\u00e1sha; I'll come\nimmediately.\"\nOn the way to his sister's room, in the passage which connected one\nwing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling\nsweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and\nartless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.\n\"Oh! I thought you were in your room,\" she said, for some reason\nblushing and dropping her eyes.\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly\ncame over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead\nand hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the\nFrenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his\nsister's room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying\none word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as\nusual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make\nup for lost time.\n\"No, but imagine the old Countess Z\u00fabova, with false curls and her\nmouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age....\nHa, ha, ha! Mary!\"\nThis very sentence about Countess Z\u00fabova and this same laugh Prince\nAndrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some\nfive times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and\nrosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking\nincessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince\nAndrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after\ntheir journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn\nnight, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole.\nServants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense\nhouse was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The\ndomestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to\nthe young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the\nreception hall: Michael Iv\u00e1novich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess",

      "text": "Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his\nfather's study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All\nwere waiting for them to come out.\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age\nspectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his\nson, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.\n\"Going?\" And he went on writing.\n\"I've come to say good-by.\"\n\"Kiss me here,\" and he touched his cheek: \"Thanks, thanks!\"\n\"What do you thank me for?\"\n\"For not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman's apron strings.\nThe Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!\" And he went on\nwriting, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. \"If you have\nanything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,\" he\nadded.\n\"About my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your\nhands....\"\n\"Why talk nonsense? Say what you want.\"\n\"When her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let\nhim be here....\"\nThe old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his\nstern eyes on his son.\n\"I know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,\" said\nPrince Andrew, evidently confused. \"I know that out of a million\ncases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been\ntelling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.\"\n\"Hm... Hm...\" muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he\nwas writing. \"I'll do it.\"\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to\nlaugh.\n\"It's a bad business, eh?\"\n\"What is bad, Father?\"\n\"The wife!\" said the old prince, briefly and significantly.\n\"I don't understand!\" said Prince Andrew.\n\"No, it can't be helped, lad,\" said the prince. \"They're\nall like that; one can't unmarry. Don't be afraid; I won't tell\nanyone, but you know it yourself.\"\nHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked\nstraight into his son's face with keen eyes which seemed to see\nthrough him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The\nold man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing\ndown the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.\n\"What's to be done? She's pretty! I will do everything. Make your\nmind easy,\" said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.\nAndrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father\nunderstood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.\n\"Listen!\" said he; \"don't worry about your wife: what can be\ndone shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilari\u00f3novich. *\nI have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not\nkeep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember\nand like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all\nright\u2014serve him. Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski's son need not serve under\nanyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.\"\n*Kut\u00fazov.\nHe spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son\nwas accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the\nlid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his\nbold, tall, close handwriting.\n\"I shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs;\nhand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond\nand a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of\nSuv\u00f3rov's wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for\nyou to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.\"\nAndrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time\nyet. He felt that he must not say it.\n\"I will do it all, Father,\" he said.\n\"Well, now, good-by!\" He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced\nhim. \"Remember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me,\nyour old father...\" he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous\nvoice suddenly shrieked: \"but if I hear that you have not behaved like\na son of Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski, I shall be ashamed!\"\n\"You need not have said that to me, Father,\" said the son with a\nsmile.\nThe old man was silent.\n\"I also wanted to ask you,\" continued Prince Andrew, \"if I'm\nkilled and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you\u2014as I\nsaid yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.\"\n\"Not let the wife have him?\" said the old man, and laughed.\nThey stood silent, facing one another. The old man's sharp eyes were\nfixed straight on his son's. Something twitched in the lower part of\nthe old prince's face.\n\"We've said good-by. Go!\" he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry\nvoice, opening his door.\n\"What is it? What?\" asked both princesses when they saw for a moment\nat the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white\ndressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.\nPrince Andrew sighed and made no reply.\n\"Well!\" he said, turning to his wife.\nAnd this \"Well!\" sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: \"Now\ngo through your performance.\"\n\"Andrew, already!\" said the little princess, turning pale and\nlooking with dismay at her husband.\nHe embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.\nHe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face,\nand carefully placed her in an easy chair.\n\"Adieu, Mary,\" said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand\nand kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.\nThe little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing\nher temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked\nwith her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince\nAndrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From\nthe study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man\nangrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study\ndoor opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white\ndressing gown looked out.\n\"Gone? That's all right!\" said he; and looking angrily at the\nunconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed\nthe door.",
