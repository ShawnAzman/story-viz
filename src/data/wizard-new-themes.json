The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more\nhappiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be\nclassed as \"historical\" in the children's library; for the time has\ncome for a series of newer \"wonder tales\" in which the stereotyped\ngenie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible\nand blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a\nfearsome moral to each tale. Modern education includes morality;\ntherefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales\nand gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\"\nwas written solely to please children of today. It aspires to being a\nmodernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and\nthe heartaches and nightmares are left out.\nL. Frank Baum",

      "text": "Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife. Their\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\nmany miles. There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\nanother corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar\u2014except a\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\ncrush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap door in the\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\nhole.\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\nthe sky in all directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it. Even the grass was\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Once the house had\nbeen painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed it\naway, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun\nand wind had changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes\nand left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and\nlips, and they were gray also. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled\nnow. When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had\nbeen so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream and\npress her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice reached\nher ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder that she\ncould find anything to laugh at.\nUncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and\ndid not know what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his\nrough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.",

There, indeed, just\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\n\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\ndismay. \"The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\"\n\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman calmly.\n\"But who was she?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the little\nwoman. \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\nare grateful to you for the favor.\"\n\"Who are the Munchkins?\" inquired Dorothy.\n\"They are the people who live in this land of the East where the Wicked\nWitch ruled.\"\n\"Are you a Munchkin?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.\nWhen they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swift\nmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.\"\n\"Oh, gracious!\" cried Dorothy. \"Are you a real witch?\"\n\"Yes, indeed,\" answered the little woman. \"But I am a good witch, and\nthe people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was who\nruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.\"\n\"But I thought all witches were wicked,\" said the girl, who was half\nfrightened at facing a real witch. \"Oh, no, that is a great mistake.\nThere were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them,\nthose who live in the North and the South, are good witches. I know\nthis is true, for I am one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken.\nThose who dwelt in the East and the West were, indeed, wicked witches;\nbut now that you have killed one of them, there is but one Wicked Witch\nin all the Land of Oz\u2014the one who lives in the West.\"",

Then she sat upon a settee and watched the\npeople dance.\nWhen Boq saw her silver shoes he said, \"You must be a great sorceress.\"\n\"Why?\" asked the girl.\n\"Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch.\nBesides, you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses\nwear white.\"\n\"My dress is blue and white checked,\" said Dorothy, smoothing out the\nwrinkles in it.\n\"It is kind of you to wear that,\" said Boq. \"Blue is the color of the\nMunchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are a friendly\nwitch.\"\nDorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to\nthink her a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary\nlittle girl who had come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange\nland.\nWhen she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house,\nwhere he gave her a room with a pretty bed in it.

When she had gone several miles she thought she would\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\nthe ripe corn.\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\nback.\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\n\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\n\"Did you speak?\" asked the girl, in wonder.\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"How do you do?\"\n\"I'm pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy politely. \"How do you\ndo?\"\n\"I'm not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"\n\"Can't you get down?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\nthe ground. \"I feel like a new man.\"\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\nyawned. \"And where are you going?\"\n\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"\n\"Where is the Emerald City?\" he inquired. \"And who is Oz?\"\n\"Why, don't you know?\" she returned, in surprise.\n\"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\nbrains at all,\" he answered sadly.\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy, \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\"\n\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\nOz would give me some brains?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" she returned, \"but you may come with me, if you like.\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\nare now.\"\n\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You see,\" he continued\nconfidentially, \"I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\ninto me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"\n\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly sorry\nfor him. \"If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for\nyou.\"\n\"Thank you,\" he answered gratefully.\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\nScarecrow.\n\"Don't mind Toto,\" said Dorothy to her new friend. \"He never bites.\"\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"He can't hurt the straw.\nDo let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can't\nget tired. I'll tell you a secret,\" he continued, as he walked along.\n\"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy; \"the Munchkin farmer who made you?\"",

I was\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\nI heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'\n\"'They aren't straight,'\" answered the other.\n\"'Never mind,'\" said the farmer. \"'They are ears just the same,'\" which\nwas true enough.\n\"'Now I'll make the eyes,'\" said the farmer. So he painted my right\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\nfirst glimpse of the world.\n\"'That's a rather pretty eye,'\" remarked the Munchkin who was watching\nthe farmer. \"'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'\n\"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'\" said the farmer. And\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\nI didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\nanyone.\n\"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. 'He\nlooks just like a man.'\n\"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\naway and left me alone.\n\"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\nsaid:\n\"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\n\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you only had\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'\n\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"",

Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\nagain.\n\"Why didn't you walk around the hole?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I don't know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \"My head is\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\nhim for some brains.\"\n\"Oh, I see,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not the\nbest things in the world.\"\n\"Have you any?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman. \"But once I had\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\nrather have a heart.\"\n\"And why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\nthe following story:\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\nleft leg.\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\n\"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\n\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\nwas only one danger\u2014that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\"\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\nnew heart.\n\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"I shall ask for brains instead of\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\none.\"\n\"I shall take the heart,\" returned the Tin Woodman; \"for brains do not\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\"\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.",

The tree made a good, thick\ncovering to protect them from the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a\ngreat pile of wood with his axe and Dorothy built a splendid fire that\nwarmed her and made her feel less lonely. She and Toto ate the last of\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\n\"If you wish,\" said the Lion, \"I will go into the forest and kill a\ndeer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are so\npeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very\ngood breakfast.\"\n\"Don't! Please don't,\" begged the Tin Woodman. \"I should certainly weep\nif you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rust again.\"\nBut the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no\none ever knew what it was, for he didn't mention it. And the Scarecrow\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\nhim up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, and only came\nnear to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep. These\nkept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.",

Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began\nto cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\n\"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\nclaws.

I\nhave been to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and\nwonderful place; but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz,\nnor do I know of any living person who has seen him.\"\n\"Does he never go out?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace,\nand even those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.\"\n\"What is he like?\" asked the girl.\n\"That is hard to tell,\" said the man thoughtfully. \"You see, Oz is a\nGreat Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say he\nlooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say\nhe looks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a\nbrownie, or in any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is,\nwhen he is in his own form, no living person can tell.\"\n\"That is very strange,\" said Dorothy, \"but we must try, in some way, to\nsee him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.\"\n\"Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?\" asked the man.\n\"I want him to give me some brains,\" said the Scarecrow eagerly.\n\"Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,\" declared the man. \"He has more\nbrains than he needs.\"\n\"And I want him to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"That will not trouble him,\" continued the man, \"for Oz has a large\ncollection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.\"\n\"And I want him to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\n\"Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,\" said the man,\n\"which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running\nover. He will be glad to give you some.\"\n\"And I want him to send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Where is Kansas?\" asked the man, with surprise.\n\"I don't know,\" replied Dorothy sorrowfully, \"but it is my home, and\nI'm sure it's somewhere.\"\n\"Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find\nKansas for you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a\nhard task; for the Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he",

Yet it\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\nCity. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched\nroom, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He\nwas clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin\nwas of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, \"What do you wish\nin the Emerald City?\"\n\"We came here to see the Great Oz,\" said Dorothy.\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\nover.\n\"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\" he said,\nshaking his head in perplexity. \"He is powerful and terrible, and if\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\"\n\"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\" replied the\nScarecrow; \"it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\nWizard.\"\n\"So he is,\" said the green man, \"and he rules the Emerald City wisely\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\nface. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the\nspectacles.\"\n\"Why?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\nthem.\"\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\nwith the key.\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.",

There was a tiny fountain in the middle of the room, that\nshot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fall back into a\nbeautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowers stood in\nthe windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.\nWhen Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer\ngreen pictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.\nIn a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and\nvelvet; and all of them fitted Dorothy exactly.\n\"Make yourself perfectly at home,\" said the green girl, \"and if you\nwish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrow\nmorning.\"\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\npart of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It\nwould not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he\nremained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web\nin a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most\nwonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\nto make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\nhimself asleep in a minute.\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\nwhispered:\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"\n\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"\n\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message to\nthe Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\npresence.\"\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \"That is the\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\nwonderful manner.\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\nDorothy heard a voice say:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\"\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\nvoice:\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"\n\"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\nher and killed her,\" she replied.\n\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\" continued the voice.\n\"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\nanswered earnestly. \"I don't like your country, although it is so\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\nbeing away so long.\"\nThe eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and\ndown to the floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see\nevery part of the room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.\n\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked Oz.\n\"Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard\nand I am only a little girl.\"\n\"But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,\" said\nOz.\n\"That just happened,\" returned Dorothy simply; \"I could not help it.\"\n\"Well,\" said the Head, \"I will give you my answer. You have no right to\nexpect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for me in\nreturn. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If\nyou wish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do\nsomething for me first. Help me and I will help you.\"\n\"What must I do?\" asked the girl.\n\"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" answered Oz.\n\"But I cannot!\" exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.\n\"You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, which\nbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all\nthis land, and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to\nKansas\u2014but not before.\"\nThe little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the\neyes winked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz\nfelt that she could help him if she would.\n\"I never killed anything, willingly,\" she sobbed. \"Even if I wanted to,\nhow could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great and Terrible,\ncannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?\"\n\"I do not know,\" said the Head; \"but that is my answer, and until the\nWicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again. Remember\nthat the Witch is Wicked\u2014tremendously Wicked\u2014and ought to be killed.\nNow go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done your task.\"\nSorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion\nand the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had\nsaid to her. \"There is no hope for me,\" she said sadly, \"for Oz will\nnot send me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and",

But if it is the\nlovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves\nsaid to be kindly hearted.\"\nBut when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the\nHead nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.\nIt was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly\nstrong enough to hold its weight.

They had made a chair of their hands and\nwere careful not to hurt her.\n\"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?\" she asked.\n\"That is a long story,\" answered the King, with a winged laugh; \"but as\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\nabout it, if you wish.\"\n\"I shall be glad to hear it,\" she replied.\n\"Once,\" began the leader, \"we were a free people, living happily in the\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\nland.\n\"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\nwas also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\nyears. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\nwoman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\nmake everything ready for the wedding.\n\"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\nlived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\nbeside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\ndo. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\ndropped him into the water.\n\"'Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, 'and see if the\nwater has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim,\nand he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\nvelvet all ruined by the river.\n\"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.\"",

Of course I let them think so, because\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\n\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"\n\"But isn't everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear green\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\nthat is needed to make one happy.

Experience is the only thing that\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\nyou are sure to get.\"\n\"That may all be true,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\"\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\n\"Well,\" he said with a sigh, \"I'm not much of a magician, as I said;\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\nthat out for yourself.\"\n\"Oh, thank you\u2014thank you!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I'll find a way to use\nthem, never fear!\"\n\"But how about my courage?\" asked the Lion anxiously.\n\"You have plenty of courage, I am sure,\" answered Oz. \"All you need is\nconfidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are\nafraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\"\n\"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same,\" said the Lion. \"I shall\nreally be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that\nmakes one forget he is afraid.\"\n\"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,\" replied Oz.\n\"How about my heart?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"Why, as for that,\" answered Oz, \"I think you are wrong to want a\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\nluck not to have a heart.\"\n\"That must be a matter of opinion,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"For my part,\nI will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me\nthe heart.\"\n\"Very well,\" answered Oz meekly. \"Come to me tomorrow and you shall\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\ncontinue the part a little longer.\"\n\"And now,\" said Dorothy, \"how am I to get back to Kansas?\"\n\"We shall have to think about that,\" replied the little man. \"Give me\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to\ncarry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in\nreturn for my help\u2014such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no\none I am a humbug.\"\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\ntheir rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that \"The Great and\nTerrible Humbug,\" as she called him, would find a way to send her back",

But the first thing to do is to cross the\ndesert, and then it should be easy to find your way home.\"\n\"How can I cross the desert?\" she inquired.\n\"Well, I'll tell you what I think,\" said the little man. \"You see, when\nI came to this country it was in a balloon. You also came through the\nair, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to get\nacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my\npowers to make a cyclone; but I've been thinking the matter over, and I\nbelieve I can make a balloon.\"\n\"How?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"A balloon,\" said Oz, \"is made of silk, which is coated with glue to\nkeep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will be\nno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas\nto fill the balloon with, to make it float.\"\n\"If it won't float,\" remarked Dorothy, \"it will be of no use to us.\"\n\"True,\" answered Oz. \"But there is another way to make it float, which\nis to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn't as good as gas, for if the\nair should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, and we\nshould be lost.\"\n\"We!\" exclaimed the girl. \"Are you going with me?\"\n\"Yes, of course,\" replied Oz. \"I am tired of being such a humbug. If I\nshould go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I am not a\nWizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them.\nSo I have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome.\nI'd much rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.\"\n\"I shall be glad to have your company,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Thank you,\" he answered. \"Now, if you will help me sew the silk\ntogether, we will begin to work on our balloon.\"",

Finally he said:\n\"Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over the\ndesert?\"\n\"I never thought of that!\" said Dorothy joyfully. \"It's just the thing.\nI'll go at once for the Golden Cap.\"\nWhen she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and\nsoon the band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and\nstood beside her.\n\"This is the second time you have called us,\" said the Monkey King,\nbowing before the little girl. \"What do you wish?\"\n\"I want you to fly with me to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\nBut the Monkey King shook his head.\n\"That cannot be done,\" he said. \"We belong to this country alone, and\ncannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,\nand I suppose there never will be, for they don't belong there. We\nshall be glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross\nthe desert. Good-bye.\"\nAnd with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away\nthrough the window, followed by all his band.\nDorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. \"I have wasted the charm\nof the Golden Cap to no purpose,\" she said, \"for the Winged Monkeys\ncannot help me.\"\n\"It is certainly too bad!\" said the tender-hearted Woodman.\nThe Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly\nthat Dorothy feared it would burst.\n\"Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,\" he said, \"and ask\nhis advice.\"\nSo the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for\nwhile Oz was alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.\n\"This little girl,\" said the Scarecrow to the soldier, \"wishes to cross\nthe desert. How can she do so?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" answered the soldier, \"for nobody has ever crossed the\ndesert, unless it is Oz himself.\"\n\"Is there no one who can help me?\" asked Dorothy earnestly.\n\"Glinda might,\" he suggested.\n\"Who is Glinda?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches,\nand rules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of\nthe desert, so she may know a way to cross it.\"\n\"Glinda is a Good Witch, isn't she?\" asked the child.\n\"The Quadlings think she is good,\" said the soldier, \"and she is kind\nto everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knows\nhow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.\"\n\"How can I get to her castle?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"The road is straight to the South,\" he answered, \"but it is said to be\nfull of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods, and a\nrace of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. For\nthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.\"\nThe soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:\n\"It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is\nto travel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of\ncourse, if Dorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.\"\n\"You must have been thinking again,\" remarked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I have,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"I shall go with Dorothy,\" declared the Lion, \"for I am tired of your\ncity and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wild\nbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.\"\n\"That is true,\" agreed the Woodman. \"My axe may be of service to her;\nso I also will go with her to the Land of the South.\"\n\"When shall we start?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"Are you going?\" they asked, in surprise.\n\"Certainly. If it wasn't for Dorothy I should never have had brains.\nShe lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to the\nEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never\nleave her until she starts back to Kansas for good and all.\"\n\"Thank you,\" said Dorothy gratefully. \"You are all very kind to me. But\nI should like to start as soon as possible.\"\n\"We shall go tomorrow morning,\" returned the Scarecrow. \"So now let us\nall get ready, for it will be a long journey.\"",

There\nwas no way of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and\nleft as far as they could see; and, besides, they did not dare change\nthe direction of their journey for fear of getting lost. So they looked\nfor the place where it would be easiest to get into the forest.\nThe Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with\nsuch wide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass\nunderneath. So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under\nthe first branches they bent down and twined around him, and the next\nminute he was raised from the ground and flung headlong among his\nfellow travelers.\nThis did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked\nrather dizzy when Dorothy picked him up.\n\"Here is another space between the trees,\" called the Lion.\n\"Let me try it first,\" said the Scarecrow, \"for it doesn't hurt me to\nget thrown about.\" He walked up to another tree, as he spoke, but its\nbranches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.\n\"This is strange,\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"What shall we do?\"\n\"The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop our\njourney,\" remarked the Lion.\n\"I believe I will try it myself,\" said the Woodman, and shouldering his\naxe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow so\nroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped\nat it so fiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking\nall its branches as if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under\nit.\n\"Come on!\" he shouted to the others. \"Be quick!\" They all ran forward\nand passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who was caught\nby a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptly\nchopped off the branch and set the little dog free.\nThe other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they\nmade up their minds that only the first row of trees could bend down\ntheir branches, and that probably these were the policemen of the\nforest, and given this wonderful power in order to keep strangers out\nof it.\nThe four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came\nto the farther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found\nbefore them a high wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was\nsmooth, like the surface of a dish, and higher than their heads.\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"I will make a ladder,\" said the Tin Woodman, \"for we certainly must\nclimb over the wall.\"",

As\nthey drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,\nthe pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china\nground with a great clatter.\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and\nthat the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor\nmilkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\n\"There!\" cried the milkmaid angrily. \"See what you have done!

What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\ncow?\"\n\"I'm very sorry,\" returned Dorothy. \"Please forgive us.\"\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She\npicked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping\non three legs.
