They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been\nused to; but neither were they very small. In fact, they seemed about\nas tall as Dorothy, who was a well-grown child for her age, although\nthey were, so far as looks go, many years older.\nThree were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore\nround hats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with\nlittle bells around the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The\nhats of the men were blue; the little woman's hat was white, and she\nwore a white gown that hung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were\nsprinkled little stars that glistened in the sun like diamonds. The men\nwere dressed in blue, of the same shade as their hats, and wore\nwell-polished boots with a deep roll of blue at the tops. The men,\nDorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for two of them had\nbeards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face was\ncovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked rather\nstiffly.\nWhen these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in the\ndoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to\ncome farther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low\nbow and said, in a sweet voice:\n\"You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins.\nWe are so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the\nEast, and for setting our people free from bondage.\"\nDorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little\nwoman possibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had\nkilled the Wicked Witch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless\nlittle girl, who had been carried by a cyclone many miles from home;\nand she had never killed anything in all her life.\nBut the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said,\nwith hesitation, \"You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I\nhave not killed anything.\"\n\"Your house did, anyway,\" replied the little old woman, with a laugh,\n\"and that is the same thing. See!\" she continued, pointing to the\ncorner of the house. \"There are her two feet, still sticking out from\nunder a block of wood.\"\nDorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just\nunder the corner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were\nsticking out, shod in silver shoes with pointed toes.\n\"Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\" cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together in\ndismay. \"The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?\"\n\"There is nothing to be done,\" said the little woman calmly.\n\"But who was she?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,\" answered the little\nwoman. \"She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,\nmaking them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and\nare grateful to you for the favor.\"\n\"Who are the Munchkins?\" inquired Dorothy.",

As for the little old woman, she took off her cap and balanced\nthe point on the end of her nose, while she counted \"One, two, three\"\nin a solemn voice. At once the cap changed to a slate, on which was\nwritten in big, white chalk marks:\n\"LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS\"\nThe little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the\nwords on it, asked, \"Is your name Dorothy, my dear?\"\n\"Yes,\" answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.\n\"Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will help you.\"\n\"Where is this city?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, the\nGreat Wizard I told you of.\"\n\"Is he a good man?\" inquired the girl anxiously.\n\"He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for I\nhave never seen him.\"\n\"How can I get there?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is\nsometimes pleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use\nall the magic arts I know of to keep you from harm.\"\n\"Won't you go with me?\" pleaded the girl, who had begun to look upon\nthe little old woman as her only friend.\n\"No, I cannot do that,\" she replied, \"but I will give you my kiss, and\nno one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch of\nthe North.\"\nShe came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where\nher lips touched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy\nfound out soon after.\n\"The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,\" said the\nWitch, \"so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid of\nhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.\"\nThe three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey,\nafter which they walked away through the trees.

Dorothy went to get him, and saw such delicious fruit hanging\nfrom the branches that she gathered some of it, finding it just what\nshe wanted to help out her breakfast.\nThen she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to\na good drink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for\nthe journey to the City of Emeralds.\nDorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was\nhanging on a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white\nand blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings,\nit was still a pretty frock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed\nherself in the clean gingham, and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head.\nShe took a little basket and filled it with bread from the cupboard,\nlaying a white cloth over the top. Then she looked down at her feet and\nnoticed how old and worn her shoes were.\n\"They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,\" she said. And\nToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his\ntail to show he knew what she meant.\nAt that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that had\nbelonged to the Witch of the East.\n\"I wonder if they will fit me,\" she said to Toto. \"They would be just\nthe thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.\"\nShe took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which\nfitted her as well as if they had been made for her.\nFinally she picked up her basket.\n\"Come along, Toto,\" she said. \"We will go to the Emerald City and ask\nthe Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.\"\nShe closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket\nof her dress.

When she had gone several miles she thought she would\nstop to rest, and so climbed to the top of the fence beside the road\nand sat down. There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far\naway she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from\nthe ripe corn.\nDorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the\nScarecrow. Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes,\nnose, and mouth painted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue\nhat, that had belonged to some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and\nthe rest of the figure was a blue suit of clothes, worn and faded,\nwhich had also been stuffed with straw. On the feet were some old boots\nwith blue tops, such as every man wore in this country, and the figure\nwas raised above the stalks of corn by means of the pole stuck up its\nback.\nWhile Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of the\nScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her.\nShe thought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the\nscarecrows in Kansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its\nhead to her in a friendly way. Then she climbed down from the fence and\nwalked up to it, while Toto ran around the pole and barked.\n\"Good day,\" said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.\n\"Did you speak?\" asked the girl, in wonder.\n\"Certainly,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"How do you do?\"\n\"I'm pretty well, thank you,\" replied Dorothy politely. \"How do you\ndo?\"\n\"I'm not feeling well,\" said the Scarecrow, with a smile, \"for it is\nvery tedious being perched up here night and day to scare away crows.\"\n\"Can't you get down?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away\nthe pole I shall be greatly obliged to you.\"\nDorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for,\nbeing stuffed with straw, it was quite light.\n\"Thank you very much,\" said the Scarecrow, when he had been set down on\nthe ground. \"I feel like a new man.\"\nDorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man\nspeak, and to see him bow and walk along beside her.\n\"Who are you?\" asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himself and\nyawned. \"And where are you going?\"\n\"My name is Dorothy,\" said the girl, \"and I am going to the Emerald\nCity, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.\"\n\"Where is the Emerald City?\" he inquired. \"And who is Oz?\"\n\"Why, don't you know?\" she returned, in surprise.\n\"No, indeed. I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no\nbrains at all,\" he answered sadly.\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy, \"I'm awfully sorry for you.\"\n\"Do you think,\" he asked, \"if I go to the Emerald City with you, that\nOz would give me some brains?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" she returned, \"but you may come with me, if you like.\nIf Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than you\nare now.\"\n\"That is true,\" said the Scarecrow. \"You see,\" he continued\nconfidentially, \"I don't mind my legs and arms and body being stuffed,\nbecause I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticks a pin\ninto me, it doesn't matter, for I can't feel it. But I do not want\npeople to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw\ninstead of with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?\"\n\"I understand how you feel,\" said the little girl, who was truly sorry\nfor him. \"If you will come with me I'll ask Oz to do all he can for\nyou.\"\n\"Thank you,\" he answered gratefully.\nThey walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and\nthey started along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.\nToto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled\naround the stuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats\nin the straw, and he often growled in an unfriendly way at the\nScarecrow.\n\"Don't mind Toto,\" said Dorothy to her new friend. \"He never bites.\"\n\"Oh, I'm not afraid,\" replied the Scarecrow. \"He can't hurt the straw.\nDo let me carry that basket for you. I shall not mind it, for I can't\nget tired. I'll tell you a secret,\" he continued, as he walked along.\n\"There is only one thing in the world I am afraid of.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy; \"the Munchkin farmer who made you?\"",

      "text": "\"Won't you tell me a story, while we are resting?\" asked the child.\nThe Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:\n\"My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I was\nonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that\ntime is all unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one\nof the first things he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what\nwas going on. There was another Munchkin with him, and the first thing\nI heard was the farmer saying, 'How do you like those ears?'\n\"'They aren't straight,'\" answered the other.\n\"'Never mind,'\" said the farmer. \"'They are ears just the same,'\" which\nwas true enough.\n\"'Now I'll make the eyes,'\" said the farmer. So he painted my right\neye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself looking at him and\nat everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this was my\nfirst glimpse of the world.\n\"'That's a rather pretty eye,'\" remarked the Munchkin who was watching\nthe farmer. \"'Blue paint is just the color for eyes.'\n\"'I think I'll make the other a little bigger,'\" said the farmer. And\nwhen the second eye was done I could see much better than before. Then\nhe made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at that time\nI didn't know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching them make\nmy body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at\nlast, I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as\nanyone.\n\"'This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,' said the farmer. 'He\nlooks just like a man.'\n\"'Why, he is a man,' said the other, and I quite agreed with him. The\nfarmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on a\ntall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked\naway and left me alone.\n\"I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.\nBut my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on\nthat pole. It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of,\nhaving been made such a little while before. Many crows and other birds\nflew into the cornfield, but as soon as they saw me they flew away\nagain, thinking I was a Munchkin; and this pleased me and made me feel\nthat I was quite an important person. By and by an old crow flew near\nme, and after looking at me carefully he perched upon my shoulder and\nsaid:\n\"'I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner. Any\ncrow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.' Then he\nhopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,\nseeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short\ntime there was a great flock of them about me.\n\"I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow\nafter all; but the old crow comforted me, saying, 'If you only had\nbrains in your head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a\nbetter man than some of them. Brains are the only things worth having\nin this world, no matter whether one is a crow or a man.'\n\"After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would try\nhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off\nthe stake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me\nbrains as soon as we get to the Emerald City.\"",

They turned and walked through the forest a few\nsteps, when Dorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine\nthat fell between the trees. She ran to the place and then stopped\nshort, with a little cry of surprise.\nOne of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing\nbeside it, with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely\nof tin. His head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he\nstood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all.\nDorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while\nToto barked sharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his\nteeth.\n\"Did you groan?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Yes,\" answered the tin man, \"I did. I've been groaning for more than a\nyear, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me.\"\n\"What can I do for you?\" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the\nsad voice in which the man spoke.\n\"Get an oil-can and oil my joints,\" he answered. \"They are rusted so\nbadly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon\nbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.\"\nDorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then\nshe returned and asked anxiously, \"Where are your joints?\"\n\"Oil my neck, first,\" replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, and as\nit was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and\nmoved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the\nman could turn it himself.\n\"Now oil the joints in my arms,\" he said. And Dorothy oiled them and\nthe Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust\nand as good as new.\nThe Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which\nhe leaned against the tree.\n\"This is a great comfort,\" he said. \"I have been holding that axe in\nthe air ever since I rusted, and I'm glad to be able to put it down at\nlast. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all right\nonce more.\"\nSo they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked\nthem again and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite\ncreature, and very grateful.\n\"I might have stood there always if you had not come along,\" he said;\n\"so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to be here?\"\n\"We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,\" she\nanswered, \"and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.\"\n\"Why do you wish to see Oz?\" he asked.\n\"I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to\nput a few brains into his head,\" she replied.\nThe Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:\n\"Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?\"\n\"Why, I guess so,\" Dorothy answered. \"It would be as easy as to give\nthe Scarecrow brains.\"\n\"True,\" the Tin Woodman returned. \"So, if you will allow me to join\nyour party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to help me.\"\n\"Come along,\" said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added that she\nwould be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his\naxe and they all passed through the forest until they came to the road\nthat was paved with yellow brick.",

But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe\nand chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire\nparty.\nDorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not\nnotice when the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the\nside of the road. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up\nagain.\n\"Why didn't you walk around the hole?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"I don't know enough,\" replied the Scarecrow cheerfully. \"My head is\nstuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going to Oz to ask\nhim for some brains.\"\n\"Oh, I see,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"But, after all, brains are not the\nbest things in the world.\"\n\"Have you any?\" inquired the Scarecrow.\n\"No, my head is quite empty,\" answered the Woodman. \"But once I had\nbrains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should much\nrather have a heart.\"\n\"And why is that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"I will tell you my story, and then you will know.\"\nSo, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told\nthe following story:\n\"I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest\nand sold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a\nwoodchopper, and after my father died I took care of my old mother as\nlong as she lived. Then I made up my mind that instead of living alone\nI would marry, so that I might not become lonely.\n\"There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soon\ngrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry\nme as soon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for\nher; so I set to work harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old\nwoman who did not want her to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she\nwished the girl to remain with her and do the cooking and the\nhousework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witch of the East, and\npromised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent the marriage.\nThereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was chopping\naway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my\nwife as soon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my\nleft leg.\n\"This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged man\ncould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and\nhad him make me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I\nwas used to it. But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for\nshe had promised the old woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin\ngirl. When I began chopping again, my axe slipped and cut off my right\nleg. Again I went to the tinsmith, and again he made me a leg out of\ntin. After this the enchanted axe cut off my arms, one after the other;\nbut, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tin ones. The Wicked\nWitch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at first I\nthought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come\nalong, and he made me a new head out of tin.\n\"I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder than\never; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a\nnew way to kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my\naxe slip again, so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into\ntwo halves. Once more the tinsmith came to my help and made me a body\nof tin, fastening my tin arms and legs and head to it, by means of\njoints, so that I could move around as well as ever. But, alas! I had\nnow no heart, so that I lost all my love for the Munchkin girl, and did\nnot care whether I married her or not. I suppose she is still living\nwith the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.\n\"My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and\nit did not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There\nwas only one danger\u2014that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in\nmy cottage and took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However,\nthere came a day when I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a\nrainstorm, before I thought of the danger my joints had rusted, and I\nwas left to stand in the woods until you came to help me. It was a\nterrible thing to undergo, but during the year I stood there I had time\nto think that the greatest loss I had known was the loss of my heart.\nWhile I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no one can\nlove who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me\none. If he does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.\"\nBoth Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story\nof the Tin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a\nnew heart.\n\"All the same,\" said the Scarecrow, \"I shall ask for brains instead of\na heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he had\none.\"\n\"I shall take the heart,\" returned the Tin Woodman; \"for brains do not\nmake one happy, and happiness is the best thing in the world.\"\nDorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her\ntwo friends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to\nKansas and Aunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had\nno brains and the Scarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.",

      "text": "All this time Dorothy and her companions had been walking through the\nthick woods. The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were\nmuch covered by dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the\nwalking was not at all good.\nThere were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the\nopen country where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there\ncame a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These\nsounds made the little girl's heart beat fast, for she did not know\nwhat made them; but Toto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy's side,\nand did not even bark in return.\n\"How long will it be,\" the child asked of the Tin Woodman, \"before we\nare out of the forest?\"\n\"I cannot tell,\" was the answer, \"for I have never been to the Emerald\nCity. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he said it\nwas a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the\ncity where Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so\nlong as I have my oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while\nyou bear upon your forehead the mark of the Good Witch's kiss, and that\nwill protect you from harm.\"\n\"But Toto!\" said the girl anxiously. \"What will protect him?\"\n\"We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,\" replied the Tin\nWoodman.\nJust as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the\nnext moment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his\npaw he sent the Scarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the\nroad, and then he struck at the Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But,\nto the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin,\nalthough the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.\nLittle Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the\nLion, and the great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when\nDorothy, fearing Toto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed\nforward and slapped the Lion upon his nose as hard as she could, while\nshe cried out:\n\"Don't you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself, a\nbig beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!\"\n\"I didn't bite him,\" said the Lion, as he rubbed his nose with his paw\nwhere Dorothy had hit it.\n\"No, but you tried to,\" she retorted. \"You are nothing but a big\ncoward.\"\n\"I know it,\" said the Lion, hanging his head in shame. \"I've always\nknown it. But how can I help it?\"\n\"I don't know, I'm sure. To think of your striking a stuffed man, like\nthe poor Scarecrow!\"\n\"Is he stuffed?\" asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pick up\nthe Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into\nshape again.\n\"Of course he's stuffed,\" replied Dorothy, who was still angry.\n\"That's why he went over so easily,\" remarked the Lion. \"It astonished\nme to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffed also?\"\n\"No,\" said Dorothy, \"he's made of tin.\" And she helped the Woodman up\nagain.\n\"That's why he nearly blunted my claws,\" said the Lion. \"When they\nscratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down my back. What\nis that little animal you are so tender of?\"\n\"He is my dog, Toto,\" answered Dorothy.\n\"Is he made of tin, or stuffed?\" asked the Lion.\n\"Neither. He's a\u2014a\u2014a meat dog,\" said the girl.\n\"Oh! He's a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that I look\nat him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a\ncoward like me,\" continued the Lion sadly.\n\"What makes you a coward?\" asked Dorothy, looking at the great beast in\nwonder, for he was as big as a small horse.\n\"It's a mystery,\" replied the Lion. \"I suppose I was born that way. All\nthe other animals in the forest naturally expect me to be brave, for\nthe Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learned that\nif I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out\nof my way. Whenever I've met a man I've been awfully scared; but I just\nroared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If\nthe elephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me,\nI should have run myself\u2014I'm such a coward; but just as soon as they\nhear me roar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them\ngo.\"\n\"But that isn't right. The King of Beasts shouldn't be a coward,\" said\nthe Scarecrow.\n\"I know it,\" returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with the tip\nof his tail. \"It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.\nBut whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.\"\n\"Perhaps you have heart disease,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"It may be,\" said the Lion.\n\"If you have,\" continued the Tin Woodman, \"you ought to be glad, for it\nproves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannot have\nheart disease.\"\n\"Perhaps,\" said the Lion thoughtfully, \"if I had no heart I should not\nbe a coward.\"\n\"Have you brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"I suppose so. I've never looked to see,\" replied the Lion.\n\"I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,\" remarked the\nScarecrow, \"for my head is stuffed with straw.\"\n\"And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,\" said the Woodman.\n\"And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,\" added\nDorothy.\n\"Do you think Oz could give me courage?\" asked the Cowardly Lion.\n\"Just as easily as he could give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"Or give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"Or send me back to Kansas,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Then, if you don't mind, I'll go with you,\" said the Lion, \"for my\nlife is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.\"\n\"You will be very welcome,\" answered Dorothy, \"for you will help to\nkeep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be more\ncowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.\"\n\"They really are,\" said the Lion, \"but that doesn't make me any braver,\nand as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall be unhappy.\"",

She and Toto ate the last of\ntheir bread, and now she did not know what they would do for breakfast.\n\"If you wish,\" said the Lion, \"I will go into the forest and kill a\ndeer for you.

And the Scarecrow\nfound a tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy's basket with them, so\nthat she would not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very\nkind and thoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the\nawkward way in which the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded\nhands were so clumsy and the nuts were so small that he dropped almost\nas many as he put in the basket. But the Scarecrow did not mind how\nlong it took him to fill the basket, for it enabled him to keep away\nfrom the fire, as he feared a spark might get into his straw and burn\nhim up.

After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow\nbrick, silently wondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would\ncome to the end of the woods and reach the bright sunshine again. To\nadd to their discomfort, they soon heard strange noises in the depths\nof the forest, and the Lion whispered to them that it was in this part\nof the country that the Kalidahs lived.\n\"What are the Kalidahs?\" asked the girl.\n\"They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads like\ntigers,\" replied the Lion, \"and with claws so long and sharp that they\ncould tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I'm terribly\nafraid of the Kalidahs.\"\n\"I'm not surprised that you are,\" returned Dorothy. \"They must be\ndreadful beasts.\"\nThe Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf\nacross the road. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew\nat once he could not leap across it.\nSo they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious\nthought the Scarecrow said:\n\"Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodman\ncan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk\nacross it easily.\"\n\"That is a first-rate idea,\" said the Lion. \"One would almost suspect\nyou had brains in your head, instead of straw.\"\nThe Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree\nwas soon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front\nlegs against the tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big\ntree tipped and fell with a crash across the ditch, with its top\nbranches on the other side.\nThey had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl\nmade them all look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them\ntwo great beasts with bodies like bears and heads like tigers.\n\"They are the Kalidahs!\" said the Cowardly Lion, beginning to tremble.\n\"Quick!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"Let us cross over.\"\nSo Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman\nfollowed, and the Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was\ncertainly afraid, turned to face the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud\nand terrible a roar that Dorothy screamed and the Scarecrow fell over\nbackward, while even the fierce beasts stopped short and looked at him\nin surprise.\nBut, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there\nwere two of them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed\nforward, and the Lion crossed over the tree and turned to see what they\nwould do next. Without stopping an instant the fierce beasts also began\nto cross the tree. And the Lion said to Dorothy:\n\"We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharp\nclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I am\nalive.\"\n\"Wait a minute!\" called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking what was\nbest to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of\nthe tree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began\nto use his axe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly\nacross, the tree fell with a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly,\nsnarling brutes with it, and both were dashed to pieces on the sharp\nrocks at the bottom.",

Yet it\nwas afternoon before they came to the great wall that surrounded the\nCity. It was high and thick and of a bright green color.\nIn front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big\ngate, all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even\nthe painted eyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.\nThere was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and\nheard a silvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly\nopen, and they all passed through and found themselves in a high arched\nroom, the walls of which glistened with countless emeralds.\nBefore them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He\nwas clothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin\nwas of a greenish tint. At his side was a large green box.\nWhen he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, \"What do you wish\nin the Emerald City?\"\n\"We came here to see the Great Oz,\" said Dorothy.\nThe man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it\nover.\n\"It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,\" he said,\nshaking his head in perplexity. \"He is powerful and terrible, and if\nyou come on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of\nthe Great Wizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.\"\n\"But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,\" replied the\nScarecrow; \"it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a good\nWizard.\"\n\"So he is,\" said the green man, \"and he rules the Emerald City wisely\nand well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him from\ncuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his\nface. I am the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the\nGreat Oz I must take you to his Palace. But first you must put on the\nspectacles.\"\n\"Why?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of the\nEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wear\nspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it\nwhen the City was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock\nthem.\"\nHe opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with\nspectacles of every size and shape. All of them had green glasses in\nthem. The Guardian of the Gates found a pair that would just fit\nDorothy and put them over her eyes. There were two golden bands\nfastened to them that passed around the back of her head, where they\nwere locked together by a little key that was at the end of a chain the\nGuardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on, Dorothy\ncould not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wish\nto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.\nThen the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin\nWoodman and the Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast\nwith the key.\nThen the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he\nwas ready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a\npeg on the wall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him\nthrough the portal into the streets of the Emerald City.",

      "text": "morning.\"\nShe left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led\nto rooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant\npart of the Palace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the\nScarecrow; for when he found himself alone in his room he stood\nstupidly in one spot, just within the doorway, to wait till morning. It\nwould not rest him to lie down, and he could not close his eyes; so he\nremained all night staring at a little spider which was weaving its web\nin a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of the most\nwonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed from\nforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not\nbeing able to sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down\nto make sure they kept in good working order. The Lion would have\npreferred a bed of dried leaves in the forest, and did not like being\nshut up in a room; but he had too much sense to let this worry him, so\nhe sprang upon the bed and rolled himself up like a cat and purred\nhimself asleep in a minute.\nThe next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch\nDorothy, and she dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of\ngreen brocaded satin. Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a\ngreen ribbon around Toto's neck, and they started for the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\nFirst they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen\nof the court, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to\ndo but talk to each other, but they always came to wait outside the\nThrone Room every morning, although they were never permitted to see\nOz. As Dorothy entered they looked at her curiously, and one of them\nwhispered:\n\"Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?\"\n\"Of course,\" answered the girl, \"if he will see me.\"\n\"Oh, he will see you,\" said the soldier who had taken her message to\nthe Wizard, \"although he does not like to have people ask to see him.\nIndeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you\ncame from. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned\nyour silver shoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about\nthe mark upon your forehead, and he decided he would admit you to his\npresence.\"\nJust then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, \"That is the\nsignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.\"\nShe opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found\nherself in a wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high\narched roof, and the walls and ceiling and floor were covered with\nlarge emeralds set closely together. In the center of the roof was a\ngreat light, as bright as the sun, which made the emeralds sparkle in a\nwonderful manner.\nBut what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble\nthat stood in the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and\nsparkled with gems, as did everything else. In the center of the chair\nwas an enormous Head, without a body to support it or any arms or legs\nwhatever. There was no hair upon this head, but it had eyes and a nose\nand mouth, and was much bigger than the head of the biggest giant.\nAs Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly\nand looked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and\nDorothy heard a voice say:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\nIt was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big\nHead; so she took courage and answered:\n\"I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.\"\nThe eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the\nvoice:\n\"Where did you get the silver shoes?\"\n\"I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on\nher and killed her,\" she replied.\n\"Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?\" continued the voice.\n\"That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade me\ngood-bye and sent me to you,\" said the girl.\nAgain the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the\ntruth. Then Oz asked, \"What do you wish me to do?\"\n\"Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,\" she\nanswered earnestly. \"I don't like your country, although it is so\nbeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my\nbeing away so long.\"",

Growing from her shoulders were wings,\ngorgeous in color and so light that they fluttered if the slightest\nbreath of air reached them.\nWhen the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would\nlet him, before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly,\nand said:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\nNow the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had\ntold him of, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.\n\"I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,\nand I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead\nof straw, so that I may become as much a man as any other in your\ndominions.\"\n\"Why should I do this for you?\" asked the Lady.\n\"Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,\"\nanswered the Scarecrow.\n\"I never grant favors without some return,\" said Oz; \"but this much I\nwill promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West, I\nwill bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you\nwill be the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.\"\n\"I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,\" said the Scarecrow, in\nsurprise.\n\"So I did. I don't care who kills her. But until she is dead I will not\ngrant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned\nthe brains you so greatly desire.\"",

He\ndid not know whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he\nhoped it would be the lovely Lady. \"For,\" he said to himself, \"if it is\nthe head, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no\nheart of its own and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the\nlovely Lady I shall beg hard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves\nsaid to be kindly hearted.\"\nBut when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the\nHead nor the Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast.\nIt was nearly as big as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly\nstrong enough to hold its weight. The Beast had a head like that of a\nrhinoceros, only there were five eyes in its face. There were five long\narms growing out of its body, and it also had five long, slim legs.\nThick, woolly hair covered every part of it, and a more\ndreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate the\nTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud\nand fast from terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all\nafraid, although he was much disappointed.\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\" spoke the Beast, in a voice that was\none great roar. \"Who are you, and why do you seek me?\"\n\"I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannot\nlove. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.\"\n\"Why should I do this?\" demanded the Beast.\n\"Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,\" answered the\nWoodman.\nOz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: \"If you indeed desire a\nheart, you must earn it.\"\n\"How?\" asked the Woodman.\n\"Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,\" replied the Beast.\n\"When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you the\nbiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.\"\nSo the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and",

She looked\ndown at Dorothy's feet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble\nwith fear, for she knew what a powerful charm belonged to them. At\nfirst the Witch was tempted to run away from Dorothy; but she happened\nto look into the child's eyes and saw how simple the soul behind them\nwas, and that the little girl did not know of the wonderful power the\nSilver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed to herself, and\nthought, \"I can still make her my slave, for she does not know how to\nuse her power.\" Then she said to Dorothy, harshly and severely:\n\"Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you\ndo not I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and the\nScarecrow.\"\nDorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle\nuntil they came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots\nand kettles and sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.\nDorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as\nshe could; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill\nher.\nWith Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the\ncourtyard and harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse\nher, she was sure, to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to\ngo to drive. But as she opened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and\nbounded at her so fiercely that the Witch was afraid, and ran out and\nshut the gate again.\n\"If I cannot harness you,\" said the Witch to the Lion, speaking through\nthe bars of the gate, \"I can starve you. You shall have nothing to eat\nuntil you do as I wish.\"\nSo after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day\nshe came to the gate at noon and asked, \"Are you ready to be harnessed\nlike a horse?\"\nAnd the Lion would answer, \"No. If you come in this yard, I will bite\nyou.\"\nThe reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that\nevery night, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from\nthe cupboard. After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw,\nand Dorothy would lie beside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy\nmane, while they talked of their troubles and tried to plan some way to\nescape. But they could find no way to get out of the castle, for it was\nconstantly guarded by the yellow Winkies, who were the slaves of the\nWicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as she told them.\nThe girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch\nthreatened to beat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in\nher hand. But, in truth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of\nthe mark upon her forehead. The child did not know this, and was full",

Her bees and her crows and her wolves\nwere lying in heaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of\nthe Golden Cap; but if she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes,\nthey would give her more power than all the other things she had lost.\nShe watched Dorothy carefully, to see if she ever took off her shoes,\nthinking she might steal them. But the child was so proud of her pretty\nshoes that she never took them off except at night and when she took\nher bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to dare go in\nDorothy's room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of water was\ngreater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy\nwas bathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let\nwater touch her in any way.\nBut the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a\ntrick that would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in\nthe middle of the kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the\niron invisible to human eyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the\nfloor she stumbled over the bar, not being able to see it, and fell at\nfull length. She was not much hurt, but in her fall one of the Silver\nShoes came off; and before she could reach it, the Witch had snatched\nit away and put it on her own skinny foot.\nThe wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for\nas long as she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their\ncharm, and Dorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how\nto do so.\nThe little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew\nangry, and said to the Witch, \"Give me back my shoe!\"\n\"I will not,\" retorted the Witch, \"for it is now my shoe, and not\nyours.\"\n\"You are a wicked creature!\" cried Dorothy. \"You have no right to take\nmy shoe from me.\"\n\"I shall keep it, just the same,\" said the Witch, laughing at her, \"and\nsomeday I shall get the other one from you, too.\"\nThis made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water\nthat stood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to\nfoot.\nInstantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as\nDorothy looked at her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall\naway.\n\"See what you have done!\" she screamed. \"In a minute I shall melt\naway.\"\n\"I'm very sorry, indeed,\" said Dorothy, who was truly frightened to see\nthe Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before her very eyes.\n\"Didn't you know water would be the end of me?\" asked the Witch, in a\nwailing, despairing voice.\n\"Of course not,\" answered Dorothy. \"How should I?\"\n\"Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have the\ncastle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a\nlittle girl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked\ndeeds. Look out\u2014here I go!\"\nWith these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass\nand began to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing\nthat she had really melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket\nof water and threw it over the mess. She then swept it all out the\ndoor. After picking out the silver shoe, which was all that was left of\nthe old woman, she cleaned and dried it with a cloth, and put it on her\nfoot again. Then, being at last free to do as she chose, she ran out to\nthe courtyard to tell the Lion that the Wicked Witch of the West had\ncome to an end, and that they were no longer prisoners in a strange\nland.",

Some of us are very good tinsmiths,\" they told her.\n\"Then bring them to me,\" she said.

At the same time her own tears fell thick\nand fast at the joy of meeting her old friend again, and these tears\ndid not need to be wiped away.

They knew, of course, they must go\nstraight east, toward the rising sun; and they started off in the right\nway.

They kept on walking, however, and at night\nthe moon came out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet\nsmelling yellow flowers and slept soundly until morning\u2014all but the\nScarecrow and the Tin Woodman.\nThe next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if\nthey were quite sure which way they were going.\n\"If we walk far enough,\" said Dorothy, \"I am sure we shall sometime\ncome to some place.\"\nBut day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but\nthe scarlet fields.

She sat down on the grass and looked at her\ncompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that\nfor the first time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly\nthat flew past his head. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked\nat Dorothy as if to ask what they should do next.\n\"Suppose we call the field mice,\" she suggested. \"They could probably\ntell us the way to the Emerald City.\"",

They had made a chair of their hands and\nwere careful not to hurt her.\n\"Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?\" she asked.\n\"That is a long story,\" answered the King, with a winged laugh; \"but as\nwe have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by telling you\nabout it, if you wish.\"\n\"I shall be glad to hear it,\" she replied.\n\"Once,\" began the leader, \"we were a free people, living happily in the\ngreat forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit, and\ndoing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some\nof us were rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull\nthe tails of the animals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing\nnuts at the people who walked in the forest. But we were careless and\nhappy and full of fun, and enjoyed every minute of the day. This was\nmany years ago, long before Oz came out of the clouds to rule over this\nland.\n\"There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who\nwas also a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the\npeople, and she was never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name\nwas Gayelette, and she lived in a handsome palace built from great\nblocks of ruby. Everyone loved her, but her greatest sorrow was that\nshe could find no one to love in return, since all the men were much\ntoo stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful and wise. At last,\nhowever, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wise beyond his\nyears. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man she\nwould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used\nall her magic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any\nwoman could wish. When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called,\nwas said to be the best and wisest man in all the land, while his manly\nbeauty was so great that Gayelette loved him dearly, and hastened to\nmake everything ready for the wedding.\n\"My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys which\nlived in the forest near Gayelette's palace, and the old fellow loved a\njoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, my\ngrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking\nbeside the river. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and\npurple velvet, and my grandfather thought he would see what he could\ndo. At his word the band flew down and seized Quelala, carried him in\ntheir arms until they were over the middle of the river, and then\ndropped him into the water.\n\"'Swim out, my fine fellow,' cried my grandfather, 'and see if the\nwater has spotted your clothes.' Quelala was much too wise not to swim,\nand he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. He\nlaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore.\nBut when Gayelette came running out to him she found his silks and\nvelvet all ruined by the river.\n\"The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had\nall the Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that\ntheir wings should be tied and they should be treated as they had\ntreated Quelala, and dropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded\nhard, for he knew the Monkeys would drown in the river with their wings\ntied, and Quelala said a kind word for them also; so that Gayelette\nfinally spared them, on condition that the Winged Monkeys should ever\nafter do three times the bidding of the owner of the Golden Cap. This\nCap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it is said to\nhave cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather and\nall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how\nit happens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the\nGolden Cap, whosoever he may be.\"",

      "text": "The four travelers walked up to the great gate of Emerald City and rang\nthe bell. After ringing several times, it was opened by the same\nGuardian of the Gates they had met before.\n\"What! are you back again?\" he asked, in surprise.\n\"Do you not see us?\" answered the Scarecrow.\n\"But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.\"\n\"We did visit her,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"And she let you go again?\" asked the man, in wonder.\n\"She could not help it, for she is melted,\" explained the Scarecrow.\n\"Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,\" said the man. \"Who melted\nher?\"\n\"It was Dorothy,\" said the Lion gravely.\n\"Good gracious!\" exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeed before\nher.\nThen he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from\nthe great box on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward\nthey passed on through the gate into the Emerald City. When the people\nheard from the Guardian of the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked\nWitch of the West, they all gathered around the travelers and followed\nthem in a great crowd to the Palace of Oz.\nThe soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door,\nbut he let them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful\ngreen girl, who showed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they\nmight rest until the Great Oz was ready to receive them.\nThe soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the\nother travelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch;\nbut Oz made no reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them\nat once, but he did not. They had no word from him the next day, nor\nthe next, nor the next. The waiting was tiresome and wearing, and at\nlast they grew vexed that Oz should treat them in so poor a fashion,\nafter sending them to undergo hardships and slavery. So the Scarecrow\nat last asked the green girl to take another message to Oz, saying if\nhe did not let them in to see him at once they would call the Winged\nMonkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.\nWhen the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he\nsent word for them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after\nnine o'clock the next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in\nthe Land of the West, and he did not wish to meet them again.\nThe four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift\nOz had promised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and\nthen she dreamed she was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how\nglad she was to have her little girl at home again.\nPromptly at nine o'clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldier\ncame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room\nof the Great Oz.\nOf course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he\nhad taken before, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about\nand saw no one at all in the room. They kept close to the door and\ncloser to one another, for the stillness of the empty room was more\ndreadful than any of the forms they had seen Oz take.\nPresently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere\nnear the top of the great dome, and it said:\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?\"\nThey looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one,\nDorothy asked, \"Where are you?\"\n\"I am everywhere,\" answered the Voice, \"but to the eyes of common\nmortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that you\nmay converse with me.\" Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to come\nstraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in\na row while Dorothy said:\n\"We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.\"\n\"What promise?\" asked Oz.\n\"You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch was\ndestroyed,\" said the girl.\n\"And you promised to give me brains,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"And you promised to give me a heart,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"And you promised to give me courage,\" said the Cowardly Lion.\n\"Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?\" asked the Voice, and Dorothy\nthought it trembled a little.\n\"Yes,\" she answered, \"I melted her with a bucket of water.\"\n\"Dear me,\" said the Voice, \"how sudden! Well, come to me tomorrow, for\nI must have time to think it over.\"\n\"You've had plenty of time already,\" said the Tin Woodman angrily.\n\"We shan't wait a day longer,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"You must keep your promises to us!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\nThe Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave\na large, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped\naway from him in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a\ncorner. As it fell with a crash they looked that way, and the next\nmoment all of them were filled with wonder. For they saw, standing in\njust the spot the screen had hidden, a little old man, with a bald head\nand a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as much surprised as they were.\nThe Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward the little man and\ncried out, \"Who are you?\"\n\"I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,\" said the little man, in a trembling\nvoice. \"But don't strike me\u2014please don't\u2014and I'll do anything you want\nme to.\"\nOur friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.\n\"I thought Oz was a great Head,\" said Dorothy.\n\"And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,\" said the Scarecrow.\n\"And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,\" said the Tin Woodman.\n\"And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,\" exclaimed the Lion.\n\"No, you are all wrong,\" said the little man meekly. \"I have been\nmaking believe.\"\n\"Making believe!\" cried Dorothy. \"Are you not a Great Wizard?\"\n\"Hush, my dear,\" he said. \"Don't speak so loud, or you will be\noverheard\u2014and I should be ruined. I'm supposed to be a Great Wizard.\"\n\"And aren't you?\" she asked.\n\"Not a bit of it, my dear; I'm just a common man.\"\n\"You're more than that,\" said the Scarecrow, in a grieved tone; \"you're\na humbug.\"\n\"Exactly so!\" declared the little man, rubbing his hands together as if\nit pleased him. \"I am a humbug.\"\n\"But this is terrible,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"How shall I ever get my\nheart?\"\n\"Or I my courage?\" asked the Lion.\n\"Or I my brains?\" wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from his eyes\nwith his coat sleeve.\n\"My dear friends,\" said Oz, \"I pray you not to speak of these little\nthings. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I'm in at being found\nout.\"\n\"Doesn't anyone else know you're a humbug?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No one knows it but you four\u2014and myself,\" replied Oz. \"I have fooled\neveryone so long that I thought I should never be found out. It was a\ngreat mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually I will\nnot see even my subjects, and so they believe I am something terrible.\"\n\"But, I don't understand,\" said Dorothy, in bewilderment. \"How was it\nthat you appeared to me as a great Head?\"\n\"That was one of my tricks,\" answered Oz. \"Step this way, please, and I\nwill tell you all about it.\"\nHe led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and\nthey all followed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great\nHead, made out of many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully\npainted face.\n\"This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,\" said Oz. \"I stood behind the\nscreen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouth open.\"\n\"But how about the voice?\" she inquired.\n\"Oh, I am a ventriloquist,\" said the little man. \"I can throw the sound\nof my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out of\nthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.\" He showed\nthe Scarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be\nthe lovely Lady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was\nnothing but a lot of skins, sewn together, with slats to keep their\nsides out. As for the Ball of Fire, the false Wizard had hung that also\nfrom the ceiling. It was really a ball of cotton, but when oil was\npoured upon it the ball burned fiercely.\n\"Really,\" said the Scarecrow, \"you ought to be ashamed of yourself for\nbeing such a humbug.\"\n\"I am\u2014I certainly am,\" answered the little man sorrowfully; \"but it was\nthe only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plenty of\nchairs; and I will tell you my story.\"\nSo they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.\n\"I was born in Omaha\u2014\"\n\"Why, that isn't very far from Kansas!\" cried Dorothy.\n\"No, but it's farther from here,\" he said, shaking his head at her\nsadly. \"When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I was very\nwell trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird or\nbeast.\" Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears\nand looked everywhere to see where she was. \"After a time,\" continued\nOz, \"I tired of that, and became a balloonist.\"\n\"What is that?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd of\npeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,\" he explained.\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"I know.\"\n\"Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so\nthat I couldn't come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so\nfar that a current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles\naway. For a day and a night I traveled through the air, and on the\nmorning of the second day I awoke and found the balloon floating over a\nstrange and beautiful country.\n\"It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself\nin the midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds,\nthought I was a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because\nthey were afraid of me, and promised to do anything I wished them to.\n\"Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them to\nbuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well.\nThen I thought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call\nit the Emerald City; and to make the name fit better I put green\nspectacles on all the people, so that everything they saw was green.\"\n\"But isn't everything here green?\" asked Dorothy.\n\"No more than in any other city,\" replied Oz; \"but when you wear green\nspectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. The\nEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man\nwhen the balloon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my\npeople have worn green glasses on their eyes so long that most of them\nthink it really is an Emerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful\nplace, abounding in jewels and precious metals, and every good thing\nthat is needed to make one happy. I have been good to the people, and\nthey like me; but ever since this Palace was built, I have shut myself\nup and would not see any of them.\n\"One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magical\npowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to do\nwonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they\nruled the people who live in the North and South and East and West.\nFortunately, the Witches of the North and South were good, and I knew\nthey would do me no harm; but the Witches of the East and West were\nterribly wicked, and had they not thought I was more powerful than they\nthemselves, they would surely have destroyed me. As it was, I lived in\ndeadly fear of them for many years; so you can imagine how pleased I\nwas when I heard your house had fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East.\nWhen you came to me, I was willing to promise anything if you would\nonly do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her, I\nam ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.\"\n\"I think you are a very bad man,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Oh, no, my dear; I'm really a very good man, but I'm a very bad\nWizard, I must admit.\"\n\"Can't you give me brains?\" asked the Scarecrow.\n\"You don't need them. You are learning something every day. A baby has\nbrains, but it doesn't know much. Experience is the only thing that\nbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience\nyou are sure to get.\"\n\"That may all be true,\" said the Scarecrow, \"but I shall be very\nunhappy unless you give me brains.\"\nThe false Wizard looked at him carefully.\n\"Well,\" he said with a sigh, \"I'm not much of a magician, as I said;\nbut if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuff your head\nwith brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you must find\nthat out for yourself.\"\n\"Oh, thank you\u2014thank you!\" cried the Scarecrow. \"I'll find a way to use\nthem, never fear!\"\n\"But how about my courage?\" asked the Lion anxiously.\n\"You have plenty of courage, I am sure,\" answered Oz. \"All you need is\nconfidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraid\nwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are\nafraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty.\"\n\"Perhaps I have, but I'm scared just the same,\" said the Lion. \"I shall\nreally be very unhappy unless you give me the sort of courage that\nmakes one forget he is afraid.\"\n\"Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,\" replied Oz.\n\"How about my heart?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\n\"Why, as for that,\" answered Oz, \"I think you are wrong to want a\nheart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are in\nluck not to have a heart.\"\n\"That must be a matter of opinion,\" said the Tin Woodman. \"For my part,\nI will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if you will give me\nthe heart.\"\n\"Very well,\" answered Oz meekly. \"Come to me tomorrow and you shall\nhave a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as well\ncontinue the part a little longer.\"\n\"And now,\" said Dorothy, \"how am I to get back to Kansas?\"\n\"We shall have to think about that,\" replied the little man. \"Give me\ntwo or three days to consider the matter and I'll try to find a way to\ncarry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all be treated as\nmy guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait upon\nyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in\nreturn for my help\u2014such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no\none I am a humbug.\"\nThey agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to\ntheir rooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that \"The Great and\nTerrible Humbug,\" as she called him, would find a way to send her back",

It took three days to sew\nall the strips together, but when it was finished they had a big bag of\ngreen silk more than twenty feet long.\nThen Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it\nairtight, after which he announced that the balloon was ready.\n\"But we must have a basket to ride in,\" he said. So he sent the soldier\nwith the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastened\nwith many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.\nWhen it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to\nmake a visit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The\nnews spread rapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the\nwonderful sight.\nOz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the\npeople gazed upon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a\nbig pile of wood, and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom\nof the balloon over the fire so that the hot air that arose from it\nwould be caught in the silken bag. Gradually the balloon swelled out\nand rose into the air, until finally the basket just touched the\nground.\nThen Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:\n\"I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow\nwill rule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.\"",

Of course they took pains not\nto light on his head and get the pins in their feet. When all were\nsafely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite\nflattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.\n\"We must cross this strange place in order to get to the other side,\"\nsaid Dorothy, \"for it would be unwise for us to go any other way except\ndue South.\"\nThey began walking through the country of the china people, and the\nfirst thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As\nthey drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool,\nthe pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china\nground with a great clatter.\nDorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and\nthat the pail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor\nmilkmaid had a nick in her left elbow.\n\"There!\" cried the milkmaid angrily. \"See what you have done! My cow\nhas broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender's shop and have\nit glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening my\ncow?\"\n\"I'm very sorry,\" returned Dorothy. \"Please forgive us.\"\nBut the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She\npicked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping\non three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful\nglances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked\nelbow close to her side.",

Don't chase me!\"\nShe had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Because,\" answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distance away,\n\"if I run I may fall down and break myself.\"\n\"But could you not be mended?\" asked the girl.\n\"Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,\"\nreplied the Princess.\n\"I suppose not,\" said Dorothy.\n\"Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,\" continued the china lady,\n\"who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himself so\noften that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn't look at all\npretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.\"\nIndeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy\ncould see that in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and\ngreen he was completely covered with cracks, running every which way\nand showing plainly that he had been mended in many places.\nThe Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his\ncheeks and nodding his head at them saucily, he said:\n\"My lady fair,\nWhy do you stare\nAt poor old Mr. Joker?\nYou're quite as stiff\nAnd prim as if\nYou'd eaten up a poker!\"\n\"Be quiet, sir!\" said the Princess. \"Can't you see these are strangers,\nand should be treated with respect?\"\n\"Well, that's respect, I expect,\" declared the Clown, and immediately\nstood upon his head.\n\"Don't mind Mr. Joker,\" said the Princess to Dorothy. \"He is\nconsiderably cracked in his head, and that makes him foolish.\"\n\"Oh, I don't mind him a bit,\" said Dorothy. \"But you are so beautiful,\"\nshe continued, \"that I am sure I could love you dearly. Won't you let\nme carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on Aunt Em's mantel? I could\ncarry you in my basket.\"\n\"That would make me very unhappy,\" answered the china Princess. \"You\nsee, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and move\naround as we please.

Of\ncourse that is all that is expected of us when we are on mantels and\ncabinets and drawing-room tables, but our lives are much pleasanter\nhere in our own country.\"\n\"I would not make you unhappy for all the world!\" exclaimed Dorothy.\n\"So I'll just say good-bye.\"\n\"Good-bye,\" replied the Princess.",
