First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled \"ORANGE MARMALADE\", but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\"Well!\" thought Alice to herself, \"after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!\" (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \"I wonder how\nmany miles I've fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) \"\u2014yes, that's about the right distance\u2014but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?\" (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\nPresently she began again. \"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\" (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all\nthe right word) \"\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\"\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you're\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \"And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\"\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\"\n(Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\" And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\" and\nsometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you see, as she couldn't answer\neither question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.",

Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!\" And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\"I'm sure I'm not Ada,\" she said, \"for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she's_ she, and _I'm_ I, and\u2014oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try\nGeography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of\nRome, and Rome\u2014no, _that's_ all wrong, I'm certain! I must have been\nchanged for Mabel! I'll try and say '_How doth the little_\u2014'\" and she\ncrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began\nto repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words\ndid not come the same as they used to do:\u2014\n\"How doth the little crocodile\nImprove his shining tail,\nAnd pour the waters of the Nile\nOn every golden scale!\n\"How cheerfully he seems to grin,\nHow neatly spread his claws,\nAnd welcome little fishes in\nWith gently smiling jaws!\"\n\"I'm sure those are not the right words,\" said poor Alice, and her eyes\nfilled with tears again as she went on, \"I must be Mabel after all, and\nI shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to\nno toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No, I've\nmade up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying 'Come up again, dear!'\nI shall only look up and say 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else'\u2014but, oh dear!\" cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, \"I do wish they _would_ put their heads down! I am so",

That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.\"\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\" So she\nbegan: \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\" (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, \"A mouse\u2014of\na mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\") The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice; \"I daresay it's\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \"O\u00f9 est ma chatte?\" which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like\ncats.\"\n\"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?\"\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone: \"don't be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,\" Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, \"and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse\u2014and she's such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your\npardon!\" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won't talk\nabout her any more if you'd rather not.\"\n\"We indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name\nagain!\"\n\"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. \"Are you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\" The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \"There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things\u2014I can't remember half of them\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and\u2014oh dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n\"I'm afraid I've offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.\nSo she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\nhistory, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"",

She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.\nNext came an angry voice\u2014the Rabbit's\u2014\"Pat! Pat! Where are you?\" And\nthen a voice she had never heard before, \"Sure then I'm here! Digging\nfor apples, yer honour!\"\n\"Digging for apples, indeed!\" said the Rabbit angrily. \"Here! Come and\nhelp me out of _this!_\" (Sounds of more broken glass.)\n\"Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?\"\n\"Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!\" (He pronounced it \"arrum.\")\n\"An arm, you goose!

This time there were\n_two_ little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. \"What a number\nof cucumber-frames there must be!\" thought Alice. \"I wonder what\nthey'll do next!

Alice replied,\nrather shyly, \"I\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said the Caterpillar sternly. \"Explain\nyourself!\"\n\"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm\nnot myself, you see.\"\n\"I don't see,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,\" Alice replied very politely,\n\"for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\"\n\"It isn't,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,\" said Alice; \"but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little\nqueer, won't you?\"\n\"Not a bit,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\" said Alice; \"all I know\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.\"\n\"You!\" said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \"Who are _you?_\"\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \"I\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\"\n\"Why?\" said the Caterpillar.\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away.\n\"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I've something\nimportant to say!\"\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.\n\"No,\" said the Caterpillar.\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you\nthink you're changed, do you?\"\n\"I'm afraid I am, sir,\" said Alice; \"I can't remember things as I\nused\u2014and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"\n\"Can't remember _what_ things?\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, I've tried to say \"How doth the little busy bee,\" but it all\ncame different!\" Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\"Repeat, \"_You are old, Father William_,'\" said the Caterpillar.\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2014\n\"You are old, Father William,\" the young man said,\n\"And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\"\n\"In my youth,\" Father William replied to his son,\n\"I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"as I mentioned before,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2014\nPray, what is the reason of that?\"\n\"In my youth,\" said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n\"I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"and your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014\nPray, how did you manage to do it?\"\n\"In my youth,\" said his father, \"I took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"one would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\"\n\"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\"\nSaid his father; \"don't give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I'll kick you down stairs!\"\n\"That is not said right,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid,\" said Alice, timidly; \"some of the\nwords have got altered.\"\n\"It is wrong from beginning to end,\" said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes.\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\"What size do you want to be?\" it asked.\n\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied; \"only one\ndoesn't like changing so often, you know.\"\n\"I _don't_ know,\" said the Caterpillar.\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\"Are you content now?\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't\nmind,\" said Alice: \"three inches is such a wretched height to be.\"\n\"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\"But I'm not used to it!\" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\nthought of herself, \"I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily\noffended!\"\n\"You'll get used to it in time,\" said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n\"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.\"\n\"One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_\" thought Alice to\nherself.\n\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",

However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *\n\"Come, my head's free at last!\" said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\"What _can_ all that green stuff be?\" said Alice. \"And where _have_ my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\"\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\"Serpent!\" screamed the Pigeon.\n\"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"\n\"Serpent, I say again!\" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, \"I've tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!\"\n\"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,\" said Alice.\n\"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\nhedges,\" the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \"but those\nserpents! There's no pleasing them!\"\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon;\n\"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\nhaven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\"\n\"I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,\" said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\"\n\"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a\u2014I'm a\u2014\"\n\"Well! _What_ are you?\" said the Pigeon. \"I can see you're trying to\ninvent something!\"\n\"I\u2014I'm a little girl,\" said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\"A likely story indeed!\" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. \"I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's\nno use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!\"\n\"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\" said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; \"but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the Pigeon; \"but if they do, why then\nthey're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.\"\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \"You're\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you're a little girl or a serpent?\"\n\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I'm not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want\n_yours_: I don't like them raw.\"\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. \"Come, there's half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n\"Whoever lives there,\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\" So she\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",

It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.\" The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \"From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\"\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.\n\"Please, then,\" said Alice, \"how am I to get in?\"\n\"There might be some sense in your knocking,\" the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, \"if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.\" He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \"But perhaps he can't help it,\"\nshe said to herself; \"his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\"\nshe repeated, aloud.\n\"I shall sit here,\" the Footman remarked, \"till tomorrow\u2014\"\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n\"\u2014or next day, maybe,\" the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n\"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's the first\nquestion, you know.\"\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \"It's really\ndreadful,\" she muttered to herself, \"the way all the creatures argue.\nIt's enough to drive one crazy!\"\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. \"I shall sit here,\" he said, \"on and off, for\ndays and days.\"\n\"But what am _I_ to do?\" said Alice.\n\"Anything you like,\" said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\"Oh, there's no use in talking to him,\" said Alice desperately: \"he's\nperfectly idiotic!\" And she opened the door and went in.",

Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \"why\nyour cat grins like that?\"\n\"It's a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's why. Pig!\"\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:\u2014\n\"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't\nknow that cats _could_ grin.\"\n\"They all can,\" said the Duchess; \"and most of 'em do.\"\n\"I don't know of any that do,\" Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n\"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess; \"and that's a fact.\"\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n\"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror. \"Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\" as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff.\n\"If everybody minded their own business,\" the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, \"the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\"\n\"Which would _not_ be an advantage,\" said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \"Just\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\"\n\"Talking of axes,\" said the Duchess, \"chop off her head!\"\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: \"Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve? I\u2014\"\n\"Oh, don't bother _me_,\" said the Duchess; \"I never could abide\nfigures!\" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\"Speak roughly to your little boy,\nAnd beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\nBecause he knows it teases.\"\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014\n\"I speak severely to my boy,\nI beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\nThe pepper when he pleases!\"\nCHORUS.\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\n\"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room.

Visit either you like: they're both mad.\"\n\"But I don't want to go among mad people,\" Alice remarked.\n\"Oh, you can't help that,\" said the Cat: \"we're all mad here. I'm mad.\nYou're mad.\"\n\"How do you know I'm mad?\" said Alice.\n\"You must be,\" said the Cat, \"or you wouldn't have come here.\"\nAlice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on \"And how\ndo you know that you're mad?\"\n\"To begin with,\" said the Cat, \"a dog's not mad. You grant that?\"\n\"I suppose so,\" said Alice.\n\"Well, then,\" the Cat went on, \"you see, a dog growls when it's angry,\nand wags its tail when it's pleased. Now _I_ growl when I'm pleased,\nand wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.\"\n\"_I_ call it purring, not growling,\" said Alice.\n\"Call it what you like,\" said the Cat. \"Do you play croquet with the\nQueen to-day?\"\n\"I should like it very much,\" said Alice, \"but I haven't been invited\nyet.\"\n\"You'll see me there,\" said the Cat, and vanished.\nAlice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer\nthings happening. While she was looking at the place where it had been,\nit suddenly appeared again.\n\"By-the-bye, what became of the baby?\" said the Cat. \"I'd nearly\nforgotten to ask.\"\n\"It turned into a pig,\" Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back\nin a natural way.\n\"I thought it would,\" said the Cat, and vanished again.\nAlice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not\nappear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in\nwhich the March Hare was said to live. \"I've seen hatters before,\" she\nsaid to herself; \"the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and\nperhaps as this is May it won't be raving mad\u2014at least not so mad as it\nwas in March.\" As she said this, she looked up, and there was the Cat",

            "text": "A Mad Tea-Party\nThere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the\nMarch Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it: a Dormouse was sitting\nbetween them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a\ncushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. \"Very\nuncomfortable for the Dormouse,\" thought Alice; \"only, as it's asleep,\nI suppose it doesn't mind.\"\nThe table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at\none corner of it: \"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw\nAlice coming. \"There's _plenty_ of room!\" said Alice indignantly, and\nshe sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.\n\"Have some wine,\" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.\nAlice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.\n\"I don't see any wine,\" she remarked.\n\"There isn't any,\" said the March Hare.\n\"Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,\" said Alice angrily.\n\"It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\"I didn't know it was _your_ table,\" said Alice; \"it's laid for a great\nmany more than three.\"\n\"Your hair wants cutting,\" said the Hatter. He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.\n\"You should learn not to make personal remarks,\" Alice said with some\nseverity; \"it's very rude.\"\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\n\"Come, we shall have some fun now!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they've\nbegun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\" she added aloud.\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least\u2014at least I mean what I\nsay\u2014that's the same thing, you know.\"\n\"Not the same thing a bit!\" said the Hatter. \"You might just as well\nsay that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!\"\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that 'I like what\nI get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!\"\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing\nas 'I sleep when I breathe'!\"\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn't much.\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \"What day of the month\nis it?\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\nAlice considered a little, and then said \"The fourth.\"\n\"Two days wrong!\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you butter wouldn't suit\nthe works!\" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" the March Hare meekly replied.\n\"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\" the Hatter grumbled:\n\"you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.\"\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.\"\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \"What a\nfunny watch!\" she remarked. \"It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\ntell what o'clock it is!\"\n\"Why should it?\" muttered the Hatter. \"Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?\"\n\"Of course not,\" Alice replied very readily: \"but that's because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\"\n\"Which is just the case with _mine_,\" said the Hatter.\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \"I don't quite\nunderstand you,\" she said, as politely as she could.\n\"The Dormouse is asleep again,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\"\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied: \"what's the answer?\"\n\"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily. \"I think you might do something better with the\ntime,\" she said, \"than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.\"\n\"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn't talk\nabout wasting _it_. It's _him_.\"\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Alice.\n\"Of course you don't!\" the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. \"I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\"\n\"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.\"\n\"Ah! that accounts for it,\" said the Hatter. \"He won't stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!\"\n(\"I only wish it was,\" the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\"That would be grand, certainly,\" said Alice thoughtfully: \"but then\u2014I\nshouldn't be hungry for it, you know.\"\n\"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\"\n\"Is that the way _you_ manage?\" Alice asked.\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \"Not I!\" he replied. \"We\nquarrelled last March\u2014just before _he_ went mad, you know\u2014\" (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \"\u2014it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you're at!'\nYou know the song, perhaps?\"\n\"I've heard something like it,\" said Alice.\n\"It goes on, you know,\" the Hatter continued, \"in this way:\u2014\n'Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle\u2014'\"\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n\"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_\u2014\" and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\n\"Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,\" said the Hatter, \"when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, 'He's murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!'\"\n\"How dreadfully savage!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won't\ndo a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.\"\nA bright idea came into Alice's head. \"Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said the Hatter with a sigh: \"it's always tea-time,\nand we've no time to wash the things between whiles.\"\n\"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\" said Alice.\n\"Exactly so,\" said the Hatter: \"as the things get used up.\"\n\"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\" Alice ventured\nto ask.\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n\"I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't know one,\" said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.\n\"Then the Dormouse shall!\" they both cried. \"Wake up, Dormouse!\" And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \"I wasn't asleep,\" he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: \"I heard every word you fellows were saying.\"\n\"Tell us a story!\" said the March Hare.\n\"Yes, please do!\" pleaded Alice.\n\"And be quick about it,\" added the Hatter, \"or you'll be asleep again\nbefore it's done.\"\n\"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\"\n\"What did they live on?\" said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.\n\"They lived on treacle,\" said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n\"They couldn't have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked;\n\"they'd have been ill.\"\n\"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"_very_ ill.\"\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't\ntake more.\"\n\"You mean you can't take _less_,\" said the Hatter: \"it's very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\n\"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,\" said Alice.\n\"Who's making personal remarks now?\" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. \"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, \"It was a treacle-well.\"\n\"There's no such thing!\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! sh!\" and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, \"If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\nyourself.\"\n\"No, please go on!\" Alice said very humbly; \"I won't interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be _one_.\"\n\"One, indeed!\" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. \"And so these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw,\nyou know\u2014\"\n\"What did they draw?\" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\"Treacle,\" said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\"I want a clean cup,\" interrupted the Hatter: \"let's all move one place\non.\"\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: \"But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?\"\n\"You can draw water out of a water-well,\" said the Hatter; \"so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well\u2014eh, stupid?\"\n\"But they were _in_ the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"\u2014well in.\"\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of\nthings\u2014everything that begins with an M\u2014\"\n\"Why with an M?\" said Alice.\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\nAlice was silent.\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: \"\u2014that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\"\n\"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don't\nthink\u2014\"\n\"Then you shouldn't talk,\" said the Hatter.\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.",

There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; \"and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,\" thought she, \"if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn't see it?\" So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely \"Who is this?\" She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\"Idiot!\" said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, \"What's your name, child?\"\n\"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn't be afraid of them!\"\n\"And who are _these?_\" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\n\"How should _I_ know?\" said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \"It's\nno business of _mine_.\"\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \"Off with her head! Off\u2014\"\n\"Nonsense!\" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \"Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!\"\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \"Turn\nthem over!\"\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\"Get up!\" said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\n\"Leave off that!\" screamed the Queen. \"You make me giddy.\" And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \"What _have_ you been doing\nhere?\"\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \"we were trying\u2014\"\n\"_I_ see!\" said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n\"Off with their heads!\" and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.\n\"You shan't be beheaded!\" said Alice, and she put them into a large\nflower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for a\nminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the\nothers.",

Soup\ndoes very well without\u2014Maybe it's always pepper that makes people\nhot-tempered,\" she went on, very much pleased at having found out a new\nkind of rule, \"and vinegar that makes them sour\u2014and camomile that makes\nthem bitter\u2014and\u2014and barley-sugar and such things that make children\nsweet-tempered. I only wish people knew _that_: then they wouldn't be\nso stingy about it, you know\u2014\"\nShe had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little\nstartled when she heard her voice close to her ear. \"You're thinking\nabout something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can't\ntell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in\na bit.\"\n\"Perhaps it hasn't one,\" Alice ventured to remark.\n\"Tut, tut, child!\" said the Duchess. \"Everything's got a moral, if only\nyou can find it.\" And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as\nshe spoke.\nAlice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the\nDuchess was _very_ ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the\nright height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an\nuncomfortably sharp chin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she\nbore it as well as she could.\n\"The game's going on rather better now,\" she said, by way of keeping up\nthe conversation a little.\n\"'Tis so,\" said the Duchess: \"and the moral of that is\u2014'Oh, 'tis love,\n'tis love, that makes the world go round!'\"\n\"Somebody said,\" Alice whispered, \"that it's done by everybody minding\ntheir own business!\"\n\"Ah, well! It means much the same thing,\" said the Duchess, digging her\nsharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added, \"and the moral of\n_that_ is\u2014'Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of\nthemselves.'\"\n\"How fond she is of finding morals in things!\" Alice thought to\nherself.\n\"I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your waist,\"\nthe Duchess said after a pause: \"the reason is, that I'm doubtful about\nthe temper of your flamingo. Shall I try the experiment?\"\n\"He might bite,\" Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious\nto have the experiment tried.\n\"Very true,\" said the Duchess: \"flamingoes and mustard both bite. And\nthe moral of that is\u2014'Birds of a feather flock together.'\"\n\"Only mustard isn't a bird,\" Alice remarked.\n\"Right, as usual,\" said the Duchess: \"what a clear way you have of\nputting things!\"\n\"It's a mineral, I _think_,\" said Alice.\n\"Of course it is,\" said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to\neverything that Alice said; \"there's a large mustard-mine near here.\nAnd the moral of that is\u2014'The more there is of mine, the less there is\nof yours.'\"\n\"Oh, I know!\" exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last\nremark, \"it's a vegetable. It doesn't look like one, but it is.\"\n\"I quite agree with you,\" said the Duchess; \"and the moral of that\nis\u2014'Be what you would seem to be'\u2014or if you'd like it put more\nsimply\u2014'Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might\nappear to others that what you were or might have been was not\notherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be\notherwise.'\"\n\"I think I should understand that better,\" Alice said very politely,\n\"if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.\"\n\"That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,\" the Duchess replied,\nin a pleased tone.\n\"Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,\" said\nAlice.\n\"Oh, don't talk about trouble!\" said the Duchess. \"I make you a present\nof everything I've said as yet.\"\n\"A cheap sort of present!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they don't give\nbirthday presents like that!\" But she did not venture to say it out\nloud.\n\"Thinking again?\" the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharp\nlittle chin.\n\"I've a right to think,\" said Alice sharply, for she was beginning to\nfeel a little worried.\n\"Just about as much right,\" said the Duchess, \"as pigs have to fly; and\nthe m\u2014\"\nBut here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away,\neven in the middle of her favourite word 'moral,' and the arm that was\nlinked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood the\nQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a\nthunderstorm.\n\"A fine day, your Majesty!\" the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.\n\"Now, I give you fair warning,\" shouted the Queen, stamping on the\nground as she spoke; \"either you or your head must be off, and that in\nabout half no time! Take your choice!\"\nThe Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.\n\"Let's go on with the game,\" the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too\nmuch frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back to the\ncroquet-ground.",

Which shall sing?\"\n\"Oh, _you_ sing,\" said the Gryphon. \"I've forgotten the words.\"\nSo they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and\nthen treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their\nforepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly\nand sadly:\u2014\n\"Will you walk a little faster?\" said a whiting to a snail.\n\"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my tail.\nSee how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!\nThey are waiting on the shingle\u2014will you come and join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\n\"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be\nWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!\"\nBut the snail replied \"Too far, too far!\" and gave a look askance\u2014\nSaid he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.\nWould not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.\n\"What matters it how far we go?\" his scaly friend replied.\n\"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.\nThe further off from England the nearer is to France\u2014\nThen turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance?\nWill you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?\"\n\"Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,\" said Alice,\nfeeling very glad that it was over at last: \"and I do so like that",

Tell her to\nbegin.\" He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.\n\"Stand up and repeat ''_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'\" said the\nGryphon.\n\"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\"\nthought Alice; \"I might as well be at school at once.\" However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:\u2014\n\"'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n\"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\"\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\"That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\" said\nthe Gryphon.\n\"Well, I never heard it before,\" said the Mock Turtle; \"but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.\"\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n\"I should like to have it explained,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\"She can't explain it,\" said the Gryphon hastily. \"Go on with the next\nverse.\"\n\"But about his toes?\" the Mock Turtle persisted. \"How _could_ he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?\"\n\"It's the first position in dancing.\" Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\"Go on with the next verse,\" the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \"it\nbegins '_I passed by his garden_.'\"\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\u2014\n\"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2014\"\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet\u2014]\n\"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\" the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, \"if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\"\n\"Yes, I think you'd better leave off,\" said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.",

He came in with a teacup in one hand\nand a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. \"I beg pardon, your\nMajesty,\" he began, \"for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished\nmy tea when I was sent for.\"\n\"You ought to have finished,\" said the King. \"When did you begin?\"\nThe Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the\ncourt, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. \"Fourteenth of March, I _think_ it\nwas,\" he said.\n\"Fifteenth,\" said the March Hare.\n\"Sixteenth,\" added the Dormouse.\n\"Write that down,\" the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly\nwrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and\nreduced the answer to shillings and pence.\n\"Take off your hat,\" the King said to the Hatter.\n\"It isn't mine,\" said the Hatter.\n\"_Stolen!_\" the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made\na memorandum of the fact.\n\"I keep them to sell,\" the Hatter added as an explanation; \"I've none\nof my own. I'm a hatter.\"\nHere the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter,\nwho turned pale and fidgeted.\n\"Give your evidence,\" said the King; \"and don't be nervous, or I'll\nhave you executed on the spot.\"\nThis did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting\nfrom one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his\nconfusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the\nbread-and-butter.\nJust at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled\nher a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to\ngrow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave\nthe court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was\nas long as there was room for her.\n\"I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.\" said the Dormouse, who was sitting\nnext to her. \"I can hardly breathe.\"\n\"I can't help it,\" said Alice very meekly: \"I'm growing.\"\n\"You've no right to grow _here_,\" said the Dormouse.\n\"Don't talk nonsense,\" said Alice more boldly: \"you know you're growing\ntoo.\"\n\"Yes, but _I_ grow at a reasonable pace,\" said the Dormouse: \"not in\nthat ridiculous fashion.\" And he got up very sulkily and crossed over\nto the other side of the court.\nAll this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and,\njust as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers\nof the court, \"Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!\"\non which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes\noff.\n\"Give your evidence,\" the King repeated angrily, \"or I'll have you\nexecuted, whether you're nervous or not.\"\n\"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" the Hatter began, in a trembling voice,\n\"\u2014and I hadn't begun my tea\u2014not above a week or so\u2014and what with the\nbread-and-butter getting so thin\u2014and the twinkling of the tea\u2014\"\n\"The twinkling of the _what?_\" said the King.\n\"It _began_ with the tea,\" the Hatter replied.\n\"Of course twinkling begins with a T!\" said the King sharply. \"Do you\ntake me for a dunce? Go on!\"\n\"I'm a poor man,\" the Hatter went on, \"and most things twinkled after\nthat\u2014only the March Hare said\u2014\"\n\"I didn't!\" the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.\n\"You did!\" said the Hatter.\n\"I deny it!\" said the March Hare.\n\"He denies it,\" said the King: \"leave out that part.\"\n\"Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said\u2014\" the Hatter went on, looking\nanxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied\nnothing, being fast asleep.\n\"After that,\" continued the Hatter, \"I cut some more bread-and-butter\u2014\"\n\"But what did the Dormouse say?\" one of the jury asked.\n\"That I can't remember,\" said the Hatter.\n\"You _must_ remember,\" remarked the King, \"or I'll have you executed.\"\nThe miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went\ndown on one knee. \"I'm a poor man, your Majesty,\" he began.\n\"You're a _very_ poor _speaker_,\" said the King.\nHere one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by\nthe officers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just\nexplain to you how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied\nup at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig,\nhead first, and then sat upon it.)\n\"I'm glad I've seen that done,\" thought Alice. \"I've so often read in\nthe newspapers, at the end of trials, \"There was some attempts at\napplause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the\ncourt,\" and I never understood what it meant till now.\"\n\"If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,\" continued the\nKing.\n\"I can't go no lower,\" said the Hatter: \"I'm on the floor, as it is.\"\n\"Then you may _sit_ down,\" the King replied.\nHere the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.\n\"Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!\" thought Alice. \"Now we shall get\non better.\"\n\"I'd rather finish my tea,\" said the Hatter, with an anxious look at\nthe Queen, who was reading the list of singers.\n\"You may go,\" said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court,\nwithout even waiting to put his shoes on.",
