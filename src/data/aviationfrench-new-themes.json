Il sentit \u00e0 plusieurs\nreprises l'appareil quitter le sol, puis reprendre contact. Deux jours plus\ntard, alors que le vent \u00e9tait fort, Cl\u00e9ment Ader lan\u00e7a sa machine devant deux\nofficiels du minist\u00e8re de la Guerre qui d\u00e9clar\u00e8rent\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Il fut cependant facile\nde constater, d'apr\u00e8s le sillage des roues, que l'appareil avait \u00e9t\u00e9\nfr\u00e9quemment soulev\u00e9 de l'arri\u00e8re et que la roue arri\u00e8re formant le gouvernail\nn'avait pas port\u00e9 constamment sur le sol\u00a0\u00bb. Les deux membres de la commission\nle virent sortir brusquement de la piste, d\u00e9crire une demi-conversion,\ns'incliner sur le c\u00f4t\u00e9 et enfin rester immobile (il semble que, la roue arri\u00e8re\nn'ayant plus assez d'adh\u00e9rence du fait de la sustentation, le pilote ait perdu\nle contr\u00f4le directionnel de sa machine qui est alors sortie de la piste puis\ns'est renvers\u00e9e sous l'effet du vent). \u00c0 la question \u00ab\u00a0 l'appareil a tendance\n\u00e0 se soulever quand il est lanc\u00e9 \u00e0 une certaine vitesse\u00a0?\u00a0\u00bb la r\u00e9ponse est \u00ab\nla d\u00e9monstration\u2026 n'a pas \u00e9t\u00e9 faite dans les deux exp\u00e9riences qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9\neffectu\u00e9es sur le terrain\u00a0\u00bb.
