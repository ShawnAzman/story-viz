That maybe you're meddling with things you shouldn't.\" He looked\naround, lowering his voice. \"I'm not saying I believe it, but\u2026 be careful,\nalright?\"\nElara nodded, her throat tight.

Elara tried to ignore him, focusing instead on the\ncrackling fire before her, but her mind kept drifting back to him. Who was he?\nAnd why did he seem to bring a shadow into the room with him?\nAfter a while, she finished her drink and stood to leave, but as she passed the\ntable where the stranger sat, she felt his gaze on her. Her steps faltered for\na moment, and she hesitated, glancing over her shoulder. His eyes were on\nher\u2014sharp, unblinking, and filled with an intensity that made her heart skip a\nbeat.

His face was still\npartially obscured, but up close, she could see the sharpness of his features,\nthe shadow of stubble along his jaw, and the cold, calculating look in his eyes.\n\"Elara, the weaver,\" he said, his voice low but carrying a strange, undeniable\nauthority.\nElara's heart raced. \"That's me,\" she said cautiously, gripping the doorframe\nto steady herself. \"Who are you?\"\n\"That's not important,\" he replied, stepping past her into the cottage as\nthough he owned the place. Elara's skin prickled at his intrusion, but before\nshe could protest, he turned to face her, his eyes glinting in the morning\nlight. \"What's important is what I need you to do.\"\nShe swallowed hard, glancing toward the loom in the corner of the room. \"And\nwhat might that be?\"\n\"I need you to weave something for me,\" the man said, his voice as smooth as\nsilk but laced with something darker. He reached into his cloak and pulled out\na small pouch, tossing it onto her worktable. The sound of clinking coins\nechoed through the cottage, the weight of the gold unmistakable.\n\"I don't just weave for anyone,\" Elara replied, crossing her arms over her\nchest, trying to maintain some semblance of control. \"What are you asking me to\nmake?\"\nThe man's gaze drifted toward the loom, then back to her. \"I need you to weave\nthe future.\"\nElara blinked, sure she had misheard him. \"The future?\" she repeated,\nincredulous. \"You can't be serious.\"\n\"I am,\" he said, his tone never wavering. \"I've heard of your... talents. I\nknow you can see things in the threads\u2014things no ordinary weaver can. I need\nyou to weave a tapestry that shows what is to come.\"\nElara's breath caught in her throat. How could he know about her visions? She\nhad told no one, not even her grandmother, about the strange things she had\nwoven recently. Her thoughts raced as she considered her options. Refusing him\ndidn't seem wise, but agreeing to such a task felt dangerous, like meddling\nwith forces she barely understood.\n\"What exactly do you want to see?\" she asked cautiously.\n\"The fate of a village,\" he replied. \"One not far from here. Glenth, I believe\nit's called.\"\nElara's blood ran cold at the name. Glenth was a neighboring village, just over\nthe hills, a place she had visited only once. \"Why Glenth?\"\n\"That's none of your concern,\" the man said, his voice hardening. \"Do we have a\ndeal or not?\"\nElara hesitated, her eyes flicking between the man and the gold on her table.\nShe knew this was a terrible idea\u2014knew that whatever power had awakened in her\nwas not meant to be used this way. But the lure of the unknown, the possibility\nof discovering more about her abilities, was too strong to resist.\n\"We have a deal,\" she whispered.",

Elara stood at the edge of the village, her hands trembling as she\nwatched the flames consume everything in their path. Her tapestry\u2014the one she\nhad woven at the mysterious man's request\u2014had shown this, every detail, from\nthe charred buildings to the terrified faces of the villagers as they fled.\nShe had not believed it would come true. Not really.\nNow, standing here, watching the chaos unfold, she felt an overwhelming sense\nof dread. This wasn't just a vision, a glimpse of what might be. This was real.\nThe future she had woven had come to pass, and she had no idea how to stop\nit\u2014or if it could even be stopped.\nThe villagers ran past her, shouting for help, carrying what little they could\nsalvage from their homes. The heat of the flames licked at her skin, but she\nremained frozen, unable to tear her eyes away from the devastation. The\nman\u2014Iskra, as he had finally introduced himself\u2014was nowhere to be seen, but she\nknew he was watching from somewhere, hidden in the shadows as his plan unfolded.\nHer mind raced, trying to make sense of it all. Had this been his goal all\nalong? To destroy Glenth? Why? And why had he chosen her to help him do it?\n\"Elara!\" A voice shouted her name, and she turned to see one of the villagers\nrunning toward her, panic in his eyes. \"Please, you have to help us!\"\nShe shook her head, backing away. \"I\u2014I can't,\" she stammered, the words\ncatching in her throat. \"I didn't mean for this to happen.\"\nThe man grabbed her arm, his grip tight, desperation in his voice. \"You're a\nweaver, aren't you? Can't you do something?\"\n\"I... I don't know,\" she whispered, her heart pounding in her chest. The power\nthat had seemed so wondrous, so full of possibility, now felt like a curse. She\nhad woven this destruction, and now she was powerless to stop it.\nThe flames roared louder, and the man released her, running back toward the\nvillage. Elara stood there, her chest heaving with guilt and fear. She had\nnever felt so small, so insignificant. What had she done? And more importantly,\nwhat would she do next?\nAs the village of Glenth burned, Elara turned and fled into the night, her mind\na whirlwind of guilt and confusion.",

Elara sat by the hearth, her hands clenched in\nher lap, staring into the flames. She had not woven since the fire in Glenth.\nThe memory of it still haunted her, filling her with a gnawing guilt she\ncouldn't shake. Her hands had been the ones to create that tapestry, to bring\nabout that destruction, even if she hadn't fully understood what she was doing.\nNow, the loom seemed like a thing of menace, its threads fraught with danger.\nThe door creaked open, and Elara looked up to see her grandmother stepping\ninside, carrying a basket of herbs from the garden. Grandmother Nira set the\nbasket down and gave Elara a long, searching look. \"You've been brooding too\nmuch, child,\" she said, her voice soft but firm. \"Sitting by the fire won't\nchange anything.\"\nElara sighed, dropping her gaze to her hands. \"What else can I do? I brought\nruin to Glenth. I... I didn't mean to, but it happened because of me.\"\nNira's eyes softened, though her expression remained grave. \"Fate is a delicate\nthing, Elara. It's not something that can be controlled easily, even by those\nwho have the gift.\"\nElara's head snapped up, her heart thudding in her chest. \"Gift?\" she repeated,\nincredulous. \"This doesn't feel like a gift. It feels like a curse.\"\nNira crossed the room and sat beside her, her hands clasped tightly in her lap.\n\"That's because you don't yet understand it. You're still learning, and you're\nfrightened, as you should be. But our family has always had this gift\u2014the\nability to weave fate into the fabric of the world.\"\nElara blinked, her mind reeling from her grandmother's words. \"Our family?\"\nNira nodded slowly, her expression solemn. \"For generations, the women in our\nfamily have been fate-weavers. It's why I've kept you so close, why I've taught\nyou the old ways. You're not the first to have seen things in the threads. But\nyou are the first in a long time to be able to truly shape them.\"\nElara's throat tightened. \"Why didn't you tell me sooner?\"\nNira's eyes flickered with something that looked like regret. \"I had hoped...\nyou wouldn't need to know. I had hoped the gift would remain dormant in you.\nBut now that it's awakened, you need to be careful, Elara. The power to weave\nfate is dangerous, not just to others but to yourself as well.\"\nThe weight of her grandmother's words settled heavily on Elara's shoulders. She\nhad always known there was something special about her family's weaving,\nsomething that set them apart from the other seamstresses in the village. But\nto learn that they had been manipulating fate, shaping the destinies of\nothers\u2014it was almost too much to comprehend.",

Without thinking, her feet carried her through the village and into\nthe forest, the trees closing in around her like a comforting embrace. The air\nwas cool and crisp, and the scent of pine and earth filled her lungs as she\nmade her way deeper into the woods.\nAfter what felt like hours, she came upon the forest shrine\u2014a hidden place\nknown only to a few, tucked away in a clearing surrounded by towering oaks. The\nshrine had always been a place of solace for Elara, a quiet refuge where she\ncould clear her mind. She sank down onto the moss-covered stone bench, her\nthoughts still racing.\nThe idea of weaving fate, of controlling the threads of people's lives,\nfrightened her. She had never wanted such power. All she had ever wanted was to\ncreate beautiful tapestries, to bring joy to the villagers with her craft. But\nnow, her hands were stained with the weight of fate, and she didn't know how to\nfree herself from it.\nHer mind drifted back to Glenth\u2014the fire, the destruction, the cries of the\nvillagers as they fled their homes. It had all happened exactly as she had seen\nit in her tapestry. How could she have known? How could she have stopped it? A\npart of her wished she had never touched that loom, never discovered the\nstrange power lurking within the threads.\nBut another part of her\u2014a quiet, insistent part\u2014wondered if there was a way to\nuse this power for good. Could she shape the threads in a way that helped\npeople, that brought about positive change instead of ruin?\nThe sound of rustling leaves drew her attention, and Elara looked up to see a\ndeer emerging from the trees. It stood at the edge of the clearing, its dark\neyes fixed on her. For a moment, they simply watched each other in silence.\nThen, without warning, the deer darted back into the forest, vanishing among\nthe shadows.\nElara exhaled slowly, her heart still pounding in her chest. She didn't have\nall the answers\u2014not yet\u2014but she knew one thing for certain: she couldn't ignore\nthis gift. It was part of her now, whether she liked it or not.

She had spent the day reflecting at the shrine, trying to come\nto terms with everything her grandmother had revealed. But there was still so\nmuch she didn't know, so much she didn't understand.\nWhen she pushed open the door, she was greeted by the sight of her younger\nsister, Lysa, sitting at the table, her small hands working diligently at a\nsimple piece of embroidery. Lysa looked up and smiled brightly when she saw\nElara, her innocent face full of warmth and curiosity. \"Elara! I was wondering\nwhen you'd come back.\"\nElara forced a smile and sat down across from her sister. \"What are you working\non?\" she asked, though her mind was still elsewhere.\n\"Just a flower,\" Lysa said, holding up the fabric to show her. \"I wanted to\nmake something pretty to give to Grandmother.\"\nElara nodded, her heart aching at the simplicity of it all. Lysa had no idea of\nthe burden their family carried, no idea of the power that ran through their\nbloodline. Elara wanted to protect her from it, to shield her from the weight\nof fate, but she knew it was only a matter of time before Lysa started asking\nquestions.\n\"Can you show me how to do that fancy stitch you use on your tapestries?\" Lysa\nasked, her wide eyes filled with admiration.\nElara hesitated, her fingers twitching as memories of the loom flooded back.\nShe didn't want Lysa to become entangled in the same web of fate that she was.\nBut she also couldn't bear to refuse her sister's request. \"Maybe another\ntime,\" she said softly. \"It's... a little more complicated than what you're\nused to.\"\nLysa's face fell, but she nodded in understanding. \"Okay,\" she said quietly,\nreturning to her embroidery. \"But someday, I want to make something as\nbeautiful as your tapestries.\"\nElara swallowed the lump in her throat, guilt washing over her. Her\ntapestries\u2014once a source of pride\u2014now felt like a dangerous tool, capable of\nshaping destinies in ways she could barely comprehend. \"Maybe someday,\" she\nwhispered, though she wasn't sure if that was a promise she could keep.",

She hadn't woven in days, afraid of what might happen if she\ndid, afraid of what she might see in the patterns. But the silence in her\ncottage had become unbearable. Her fingers itched for the rhythm of the\nshuttle, the simple act of creation. Perhaps, she thought, if she started\nsmall, if she focused on weaving something mundane, she could avoid the dangers\nthat had come with her recent work.\nShe took a deep breath, her hands moving hesitantly at first, then more surely\nas the familiar motions returned. The threads seemed normal\u2014nothing strange, no\nsense of fate guiding her hands, just the usual flow of wool and linen. But\neven as she worked, she couldn't help but wonder if the power was still lurking\nthere, beneath the surface, waiting to spring into action.\nHours passed, the sunlight dimming as the day slipped into evening. Elara had\nnearly finished a simple tapestry\u2014a scene of the village with its bustling\nsquare and peaceful fields in the distance\u2014when she felt a subtle shift in the\nair. The loom thrummed beneath her fingers, the threads tightening, pulling her\nhands in a direction she hadn't intended. Her breath caught, but this time, she\ndidn't stop. She let the loom guide her, trusting the process, allowing the\nthreads to weave whatever story they had to tell.\nSlowly, a new image began to take shape\u2014a cluster of villagers in the square,\ntheir faces turned toward one another in quiet conversation. But there was\nsomething different about the scene. Elara's fingers moved with a strange\ncertainty, adding tiny, subtle changes to the threads\u2014an arm brushing against\nanother, a smile exchanged between two neighbors. It was as if she were weaving\nnot just the present, but something more, a gentle nudge that seemed to steer\nthe interactions in a specific direction.\nShe stepped back, her heart pounding in her chest. The tapestry was small,\nnothing grand, but it felt... different. As though she had woven more than just\na picture. She had woven possibility. She had woven change. And though she\ncouldn't be sure, she felt a quiet sense of hope stir within her, a small\nglimmer of possibility that maybe, just maybe, she could use this power for\ngood.",

This wasn't fear\nor accusation. This was a mother, desperate for help, for any chance to save\nher child.\nElara swallowed hard, glancing from Daria to the loom in the corner of the\nroom. \"I don't know if I can help,\" she said quietly, her hands trembling\nslightly. \"But I'll try.\"\nDaria's eyes filled with gratitude as she placed Galen on the small bed near\nthe hearth, the boy barely stirring as she laid him down.

There were still whispers\u2014still fear\u2014but\nsomething had shifted.\nAs she made her way through the square, she caught sight of Jarek, a local\nmerchant, standing at his stall.

He was\ntalking to his neighbor\u2014talking, not arguing. The usual scowl that marred his\nface was gone, replaced by a look of quiet relief.\nElara's heart skipped a beat. Could this be the result of her weaving? She\nhadn't meant to target anyone specifically, but she had woven small changes,\nsubtle nudges in the fabric of the village's daily life. And now, it seemed,\nthose changes were taking root.\n\"Morning, Elara,\" Jarek called, his tone friendlier than usual. \"Care for some\napples?

He was tall, dressed in dark robes\nthat billowed in the wind, with an air of authority that made him stand out\namong the simple villagers. His gaze was fixed on her, and though his face was\nunfamiliar, there was something unsettlingly familiar in the way he held\nhimself.\nThe villagers parted as he walked toward her, their whispers filling the\nsquare. Elara's heart quickened. This man wasn't from the village\u2014he wasn't\nlike anyone she had ever met before. And yet, there was no mistaking that he\nhad come for her. As he approached, the noise around her seemed to fade, until\nit was just the two of them standing amidst the sea of onlookers.\n\"Elara,\" he said, his voice smooth, almost too smooth. \"I've been waiting for\nyou.\"\nShe blinked, her hand instinctively moving toward the edge of her shawl,\ngripping it tightly. \"Who are you?\" she asked, her voice quieter than she\nintended.\nHe smiled, though the gesture didn't reach his eyes. \"My name is Maelis. I come\non behalf of the Weaver's Guild.\"\nThe mention of the guild sent a chill down Elara's spine. She had heard\nwhispers of it before\u2014a secretive organization that was said to control the\nthreads of fate. But they were just stories, passed down through generations.\nShe had never imagined they were real, let alone that they would come looking\nfor her.\n\"What do you want with me?\" she asked, trying to keep her voice steady.\nMaelis stepped closer, his gaze never wavering. \"You've been weaving fate,\nhaven't you?\" he said softly, though there was no judgment in his tone, only\ncuriosity. \"The things you've done\u2014both intentional and unintentional\u2014have not\ngone unnoticed. The guild has been watching.\"\nElara's breath caught. The idea that she had been observed, that her actions\nhad been tracked, sent a wave of fear through her. \"I never meant to\u2014\"\n\"It doesn't matter what you meant,\" Maelis interrupted, his voice calm but\nfirm. \"What matters is what you can do. And the guild is very interested in\nyour talents.\"\nShe took a step back, her mind racing. \"I don't want anything to do with your\nguild.\"\nHis smile widened, but there was no warmth in it. \"It's not a matter of what\nyou want, Elara. It's a matter of what is meant to be.\"\nBefore she could respond, Maelis turned and began walking toward the edge of\nthe village. \"Think carefully,\" he called over his shoulder. \"The guild offers\npower, control over your gift. But if you choose to walk away... there are\nconsequences.\"",

And if she refused, what consequences would she face?\nA rustling sound in the underbrush startled her, and she opened her eyes to see\na figure emerging from the shadows.

The idea of\ncontrol was tempting\u2014terrifying, but tempting. \"I need time to think,\" she\nsaid, her voice wavering slightly.\nMaelis nodded, though his gaze remained sharp. \"Take all the time you need.

She could see the threads intertwining, forming a complex pattern\nthat seemed both chaotic and ordered at the same time. She reached out to touch\nit, but Maelis's hand shot out, grabbing her wrist.\n\"Careful,\" he said, his voice low and dangerous. \"One touch could unravel a\nlife.\"\nElara pulled her hand back, her mind racing. The power the guild held\u2014it was\nunimaginable. And yet, it felt wrong. This was not weaving to create, to bring\nbeauty or meaning. This was weaving to control, to manipulate. And suddenly,\nshe understood why her grandmother had warned her about the guild.\nMaelis's eyes bore into hers, as if he could sense her thoughts. \"This is the\ntrue power of the guild,\" he said softly. \"This is what you have rejected.\"\nElara's breath caught. \"You... you control everything?\"\nMaelis nodded. \"We shape the world as we see fit. Every king, every war, every\nlove, every death\u2014it all happens because we allow it to.\"\nElara stepped back, the enormity of it all pressing down on her. \"This isn't\nright,\" she whispered. \"You can't control people's lives like this.\"\nMaelis's smile was cold. \"You're na\u00efve, Elara. The world needs order. Without\nthe guild, chaos would reign. People would be lost, directionless. We give them\npurpose.\"\nElara shook her head, her heart racing. \"No. You take their choices away. You\nsteal their freedom.\"\nMaelis's eyes darkened. \"Freedom is a lie. The guild knows the truth of fate.\nAnd now, so do you.\"",

You have the power to change things. You don't have to\nbe part of the guild to control your gift. You can choose your own path.\"\nElara's heart pounded in her chest. \"But how?

Rurik stood at the center, his voice raised\nas he rallied the crowd. Elara's stomach churned. He had been stirring up\nresentment against her for weeks, and now it seemed he had succeeded in turning\nthe entire village against her.\n\"She's brought nothing but ruin to this village!\" Rurik shouted, his fists\nclenched as he addressed the crowd. \"And now the guild is coming for her. Do\nyou really think they'll stop with her? They'll destroy everything she's\ntouched. We can't let that happen!\"\nThe crowd murmured in agreement, their eyes filled with fear and hatred.

Valeria's weaving was unlike\nanything she had ever seen\u2014precise, controlled, powerful.\nBut even as Valeria fought, Elara could feel the weight of the guild's power\npressing down on them.
