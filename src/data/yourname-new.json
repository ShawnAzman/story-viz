Oh, right\u2014I was on a train.\nThe moment I realize this, I'm standing in a packed train car. A pair of wide\neyes hovers right in front of me. A girl in a uniform is staring straight at me, but\nthe press of disembarking passengers is pushing her farther away.\n\"My name is Mitsuha!\"\nThe girl shouts, undoing the cord she'd used to tie back her hair and holding\nit out to me. Without thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray\nof evening sun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that\ncolor tight.\nAt that point, my eyes open.\nThe girl's voice\u2014its echoes\u2014still whispers in my ears.\n.. .Her name is Mitsuha?\nI don't know the name, and I don't know the girl. She looked really\ndesperate somehow. Her eyes were brimming with tears. I'd never seen the\nstyle of uniform she was wearing. Her expression was serious, even grave, as\nif the fate of the universe rested in her hands.\nStill, it was just a dream. It doesn't mean anything. By the time I think about\nit, I can't even remember her face. The echoes in my ears are already gone,\ntoo.",

I can't show weakness by\napologizing! I think, opening the rice cooker and scooping a gleaming white\nhelping into my bowl. Whoops, is that too much? Well, never mind.\n\"Thanks for the food!\"\nI pour a generous dose of sauce over a smooth fried egg, pair it with rice,\nand put it in my mouth. Oh, yum. This just might be paradise... Hmm? I feel\neyes trained on me, somewhere around my temple.\n\"So you're normal today, are you?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nGran is watching me steadily as I chew my food.\n\"She sure was somethin' else yesterday!\" Yotsuha smirks at me. \"Screamin'\nall of a sudden like that.\"\nScreaming? Gran inspects me suspiciously, and Yotsuha grins (mocking me,\nI'm sure).\n\"Huh? What? What do you mean? What?!\"\nSeriously, what's the matter with them? It's creepy.\nDing-dong-ding-do oong.\nSuddenly, the speaker over the door comes alive, deafeningly loud.\n\"Good morning, everyone.\"\nThe voice belongs to my friend Saya's big sister (currently employed by the\nRegional Life Information Section at the town hall). This place, Itomori, is a\ndinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either\nknow each other or at least know someone in common.\n\"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori.\"\nThe slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. \"Here\nare...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori.\" There are speakers\noutside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and\noverlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.\nTwice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast\nplays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the\ndaily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how\nto contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,\ntoday's funerals.\n\"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on\nthe twentieth of next month, the town election management committee\nhas\u2014\"\nClick.\nThe speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's\npulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but\neven so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by\nher chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.\nPicking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts\nspeaking.\n\"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only\nonce every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be\nvisible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the\ncorner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation\nto study it.\"\nThere's a line of text on the screen \u2014Comet Tiamat visible to the naked\neye next month \u2014and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its\nmomentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and\nthe NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like\nwhispered chatter during class.\n\"... Just make up with him already, wouldja?\"\nOut of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.\n\"It's an adult problem,\" I snap at her.\nThat's right\u2014this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the\nwind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.\nSaying bye to Gran in unison, Yotsuha and I head out the door.",

Below us is a round lake, Itomori Lake. Its calm\nsurface reflects the morning sun, glittering and glaring as though nobody's\nwatching. The deep-green mountains form their ranks under white clouds in a\nblue sky, and a little girl with pigtails and a red school backpack skips along\nfor no reason. Then there's me beside her, the dazzling, bare-legged high\nschool girl. In my head, I try adding a grand string score to the scene as\nbackground music. Ooh, it's just like the opening of a Japanese film... In other\nwords, we live in the boonies\u2014very Japanese and a few decades behind the\ntimes.\n\"Miiitsuhaaa!\"\nAfter Yotsuha and I part ways in front of the elementary school, a voice\ncalls out from behind me. It's Tesshi, pedaling his bike and looking cranky,\nwith Saya seated primly on the bike rack and smiling.\n\"Hurry up and get off,\" Tesshi grumbles.\n\"I'm fine right here. Don't be stingy!\"\n\"C'mon, you're heavy.\"\n\"And you're rude!\"\nThis early in the morning, and they're already teasing each other like a\nmarried couple in a comedy skit.\n\"You two get along so well.\"\n\"We do not!\" they chorus.\nThey deny it so earnestly it's funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack\nswitches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a\ngood ten years\u2014petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and\ntall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look\nlike they're fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly\nsynced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.\n\"Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today.\"\nSaya, who's gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,\ngrinning. My hair's fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied\ntogether in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.\n\"Huh? What about my hair?\"\nHer comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in\nthe shuffle at breakfast. I did it \"properly\" today\u2014does that mean it was weird\nyesterday? As I'm trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking\nconcerned. \"Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn't you?\"\n\"Exorcise?\"\n\"Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!\"\n\".. .Excuse me?\" I frown at the unexpected remark.\nSaya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. \"Would you quit blamin'\neverythin' on the occult already?! Mitsuha's probably just stressed, that's all.\nRight?\"\nStressed?\n\"Huh? Wait, hold it\u2014what's all this about?\"\nWhy is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can't\nremember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it was just a regular day.\n...Hmm?\nWait, was it really? Yesterday, I...\n\"\u2014And most importantly!\"\nA deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.\nOn the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little\ncrowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal\nparking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and\nbolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit\njacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent\u2014Toshiki Miyamizu. He's stumping for\nthe mayoral election.\n\"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the\nvillage restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we\nbe able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I\nintend to refine the community planning I've been involved with and see it\nthrough to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,\ncreating a local society in which everyone\u2014from our children to our senior\ncitizens\u2014can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my\nresolve to make this vision my goal...\"\nIt's such a skillful speech that it's almost overbearing. It leaves me cold\u2014\nthis campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot\nsurrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd\u2014 \"You know it's\ngonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, \" \"It sounds like he s been\nspreadin ' lots of cash around\" \u2014make my mood even darker.\n\"Hey, Miyamizu.\"\n\"...Mornin'.\"\nWonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I'm less than fond of.\nEven in high school, they're part of the flashy \"in-crowd,\" and they snark at us\n\u2014the \"drones\"\u2014over every little thing.\n\"The mayor and the contractor,\" one of them says, shooting a deliberate\nglance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi's dad standing next\nto mine, beaming. He's wearing a jacket from his construction company and an\narmband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.\nThe guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. \"Their kids are all\nbuddy-buddy, too. Did your folks tell you to hang out together?\"\nThis is so stupid. I don't even answer\u2014I walk faster, trying to get out of\nthere. Tesshi's expressionless. Only Saya looks bothered and a bit flustered.\n\"Mitsuha!\"\nSuddenly, a loud voice booms out. Yeep! My breath catches in my throat. I\ndon't believe this. My dad lowered his mic midspeech to shout at me without\nthe aid of electronic amplification. The whole crowd turns to look at me.\n\"Mitsuha, straighten up!\"\nI turn beet red. It's so unfair that I almost start crying. I want to run, but I\ndesperately fight back the urge and stride away instead.\nThe crowd is whispering. \"He's even tough on family.\"\n\"That's the mayor for you.\"\nI hear my classmates snickering. \"Ooh. Harsh.\"\n\"I kinda feel a little sorry for her.\"\nThis could not be worse.",

This is the origin of the term tasogare, or\ntwilight. You know the word twilight, don't you?\"\nSpeaking in a clear voice, our teacher, Miss Yuki, writes Tasokare in big\nletters on the blackboard.\n\"It's evening, not quite day or night. It's a window when outlines blur,\nmaking it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that\nisn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has\nanother name that reflects this. They say, though, that even before that, it had\nother names.\"\nMiss Yuki writes the two terms on the board, but it looks like she's just\nshuffling around the same letters.\n\"'Scuse me, teacher! Question! What about half-lightl \"\nSomebody speaks up, and I think, Yeah, that's right. I know twilight, of\ncourse, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was\nlittle is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently. You know,\nour classics teacher is much too pretty to be teaching at a country high school\nlike this.\n\"I expect that's local dialect, isn't it? I hear the elderly people in Itomori\nstill use ancient Japanese words here and there.\"\n\"'Cause this here's the sticks,\" proclaims one of the boys, and people start\ngiggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to\nask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were\nabandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly\npondering, I flip through my notebook, and then\u2014on a page that should be\nblank\u2014I see something written in big letters:\nWho are you?\n...Huh?\nWhat is this? The sounds around me fade and grow distant, as if being\nabsorbed by the unfamiliar handwriting. That's not mine. I haven't lent my\nnotebook to anybody, either. What? \"Who am I?\" What's that supposed to\nmean?\n\"...zu. You're next, Miss Miyamizu!\"\n\"Oh! Yes'm!\" I stand up hastily.\n\"Begin reading on page ninety-eight, please,\" Miss Yuki tells me.\nScrutinizing my face, she adds, sounding amused, \"Good to see that you\nremember your name today, Miss Miyamizu.\"\nAt that, the whole class bursts out laughing. Excuse me? Seriously, what is\ngoing on?!\n\"You don't remember?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"For real?\"\n\"Yes, for real,\" I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's\nlooking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.\n\".. .No, listen.

Tonight, I must perform my awful\nduty, but I hope you can enjoy your youth.\n\"Awww, I wanna do it, too,\" Yotsuha grumbles.\n\"It's too soon for you yet, Yotsuha,\" hushes Gran.\nThe constant click of spherical weights knocking together echoes in a\nworkroom big enough for only about eight tatami mats. \"Listen to the voice of\nthe thread,\" Gran tells her. Even as she speaks, her hands don't pause in their\nwork. \"If you keep windin' threads that way, before long, emotions will start\nrunnin' between you and the thread.\"\n\"Huh? But thread doesn't talk.\"\n\"Our braided cords\u2014,\" Gran continues, ignoring Yotsuha's objection. All\nthree of us are wearing kimonos, and we're finishing up the cords that we'll\nuse in tonight's ceremony.\nBraided cords are made of thin threads plaited together into a single rope.\nIt's a traditional folk art that's been handed down for a very long time. The\nfinished cords are cute and colorful, with all sorts of designs braided into\nthem. That said, the work takes quite a bit of skill, so Gran's making Yotsuha's\nfor her. Yotsuha's spending the time doing assistant work, winding thread\naround the ball-weights.\n\"Our braided cords hold a thousand years of Itomori's history.

On this day,\nwe wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear\njingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura\nhall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose\nmeaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.\nWe're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,\ntwirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.\nDuring my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and\ngot even more depressed. Those little\u2014 I told them and told them not to come,\nand they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text\nthem tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.\nSure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,\nI'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual.

We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small\nwooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,\na diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.\nMunch, munch, munch.\nMunch, munch.\nAgh, I swear...\nMunch, munch, munch.\nI'm going to have to do it soon.\nMunch, munch.\nArrrgh.\nMunch.\nGiving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,\nattempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.\nAnd then. Aaagh.\nPuckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The\nmixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I\nfeel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.\nPlease, nobody look at me.\nMouth-brewed sake.\nIt's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with\nsaliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to\nthe gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I\ndon't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first\ncentury... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!\nI mean, what's the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice\nand put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the\nexact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over\nand over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble...

And\nanyway, what's got you so shook up?\"\n\"It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!\"\nI glare at Yotsuha. We've changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office\nentrance.\nAfter the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a\nbanquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was\nthe hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.\n\"How old are you now, li'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin'a\nsweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. \"\n\"Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead\u2014drink some\nmore!\"\nWe entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally\nturned us loose just now, saying, \"You kids can go on home.\" Gran and the\nother adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.\n\"Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?\"\nOn the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool\nsounds of insect songs echo all around us.\n\"I dunno. Sixty?\"\n\"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!\"\n\"Huh.\"\n\"Now that we're gone, it's ninety-one in there! They're pushin' a hundred.\nThey're in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the\nwhole place!\"\n\"Hmm...\"\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but\nYotsuha's response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,\nshe's just a little kid. She wouldn't understand her big sister's agony. Giving\nup, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,\nshining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.\n\"...That's it!\"\nAs we descend the shrine's long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha\nsuddenly cries out. She's wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a\ncake someone hid from her.\n\"Sis, why don't you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay\nyour way to Tokyo?!\"\nFor a moment, I'm speechless.\n\".. .You've got quite the mind to come up with that.\"\n\"You could send snapshots and 'makin' of' documentary videos with it and\ncall it 'Shrine Maiden Sake' or somethin'! I bet that'd sell!\"\nShould I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?\nStill, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she\nreally is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I'll\ngive this sake business idea some serious thought... Wait, can you just sell\nsake on your own like that?\n\"Well? What do you think, Sis?\"\n\"Hmm...\"\n.. .And that's all I have to say.\n\".. .Wait, no! It'd be against the liquor laws!\"\nWait, was that the problem? I wonder, and when I come back to myself,\nI've broken into a run. All sorts of incidents and feelings and prospects and\ndoubts and despairs are jumbled together inside me, and it feels like my heart's\nabout to explode. I run down the steps, taking them two at a time, slam on the\nbrakes under the torii gate on the landing, and suck in a huge lungful of chilly\nnight air.

Was it that one dude?\"\n\"I think something like that's happened before...\"\n\"Was someone harassing you?\"\n\"Do you remember the guy's face?\"\nSeveral staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.\nEyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the\nwords I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I\nsee little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.\nThis time, I need to rescue her.\nThe thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,\nI've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking.

For\nsome reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing\nroom sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate\nrepair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly\ngood at.\n\"All done!\"\nI hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to\nfinish.\n\"...Huh? This is...\"\nThe dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing\nroom quickly shifts to surprise.\n\"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!\"\nThe tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so\nas I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.\nThe skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought\nbeing a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like\nOkudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but\nwhen she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the\nneighborhood.\n\"You really saved me today. Thank you very much.\"\nI finally managed to say it.\n\"Heh-heh!\" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.\n\"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but\nyou're always so quick to fight.\"\nAs she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I\ngrasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.\n\"I like this version of you better,\" Okudera-senpai says, a bit\nmischievously. \"You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki.\"\nMy heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing.

Then, out of nowhere...\nWho are you?\nFor some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.\nVaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room\nin Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there's something\noddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the\npalm of my hand, I write:\nMitsuha\nYaaaawwn...\nThat's the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,\nthrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored\nshower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to\nfinish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana's going to react when he sees the\nwriting on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.",

Why's the body of our shrine's god all the way out here?\"\nYotsuha whines.\nGran, who's walking in front of us, answers without turning around.\n\"Thanks to Mayugorou, I don't know, either.\"\nMayugorou?\n\".. .Who's that?\" I whisper to Yotsuha, who's plodding along next to me.\n\"Huh? Youdunno? He's famous.\"\nFamous? I don't really get how these relationships work in the country.\nThe three Miyamizu women\u2014me, the grandma, and Yotsuha\u2014have been\nhiking mountain roads for almost an hour already. Today, they tell me, we're\ntaking an offering up to the body of their shrine's god on top of the mountain.\nThese people are living in a folktale , I think, thoroughly impressed.\nThe sun shining through the canopy of maple leaves dyes them bright red.\nThe air is crisp and dry, and there's a strong scent of dead leaves in the\npleasant wind. October. Who knows when it happened, but it's full autumn in\nthis town now.\nCome to think of it, I wonder how old this old lady is.\nThe thought comes to me gazing at the small back ahead of me. Even on this\nmountain trail, she's wearing traditional clothes. She's a surprisingly strong\nwalker, but her back has a textbook stoop, and she's using a walking stick. I've\nnever lived with an old person, so I can't even begin to guess her age or what\nkind of shape she's in.\n\"Hey, Grandma!\"\nI break into a run, then kneel in front of her, offering my back. After all, this\nlittle old lady is raising Mitsuha and her sister, and she always packs us really\ngood lunches.\n\"Let me piggyback you. If you want...\"\n\"Oh, may I?\" Even as she speaks, she's happily lowering her weight onto\nmy back. I catch a distinct whiff of a mysterious fragrance I smelled once at\nsomebody else's house a very long time ago. For a moment, I get a strange,\nwarm feeling, as if this moment has happened before. The old lady weighs\nnothing.\n\"Grandma, you're way light\u2014 Whoa!\"\nThe moment I stand, the added cargo buckles my (Mitsuha's) knees.\nYotsuha hastily supports me, complaining, \"Come on, Sis!\" Come to think of it,\nMitsuha's body is pretty flimsy and thin and light, too. Moving through the\nworld this way.. .it's kinda amazing. The thought gets to me a bit.\n\"Mitsuha, Yotsuha.\"\nI hear the old lady's voice over my shoulder, sounding serene.\n\"Are you familiar with musubiT '\n\" MusubiT '\nYotsuha asks the question from beside me. She's hugging my backpack to\nher stomach. Below us, through the gaps between the trees, I can see the whole\nround lake. We've climbed pretty high. Mitsuha's body is all sweaty from\nclimbing with her grandma on her back.\n\"In the old language, our local guardian deity is called Musubi, 'creator of\nspirits.' It's a word with several very profound meanin's.\"\nGuardian deity? Where'd this come from all of a sudden? Still, the old\nlady's voice is like something out of the Manga Japan Folktales program, and\nit's oddly persuasive.\n\"Did you know?\" she starts again. \"Joinin' threads is called musubi. Joinin'\npeople is also musubi. The passage of time is musubi , too. They all use the\nsame word. It's a name for our god, and the god's power. It describes the\nbraided cords we make, divine acts, and the flow of time itself.\"\nI can hear the murmur of running water. Must be a stream around here, I\nthink.\n\"Cornin' together to form a shape, twistin' and tanglin', sometimes cornin'\nundone, breakin' off, then reunitin'. That's a braided cord. That's time. That's\nmusubi .\"\nWithout really meaning to, I visualize a stream of clear water. It runs up\nagainst rocks and splits, mingles with others, joins up again, and, seen as a\nwhole, it's all connected. I don't really understand what the old lady's saying,\nbut I feel as if I've learned something very important. Musubi. Even after I\nwake up, I'll make sure to remember that word. Sweat drips off my chin,\nfalling to the ground with a distinctive plop, and is absorbed into the dry\nmountain.\n\"Here, drink up.\"\nWe take a short break in the shade. The old lady hands me a thermos.\nIt's nothing big, just sweetened barley tea. Even so, it's shockingly good,\nand I drain two cups in a row. \"C'mon! Me too!\" Yotsuha pesters. This may be\nthe best drink I've ever had.\n\"That's another musubi.\"\n\"Huh?\"\nAs I hand the thermos to Yotsuha, I involuntarily look over at the old lady.\nShe's sitting at the base of a tree.\n\"Puttin' anythin' in your body, whether it's water, rice, or sake, is also\ncalled musubi. Did you know that? What you put in your body binds to your\nsoul, you see. And so, the offerin' we're makin' today is an important tradition\nmeant to connect the god and humans to each other, a custom that the Miyamizu\nfamily has observed for centuries.\"",

I don't\nknow the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can\nmake out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's\nsummer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem\noddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you\ngo. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. \"Shibuya\nand Ikebukuro,\" for example, or \"Akasaka and Kichijouji,\" or \"Meguro and\nTachikawa.\"\nEven so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.\nThis one is different from the others.\nWell, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place\u2014the contours\nof the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red\nshrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick\nout your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I\nnever actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations\nwhen I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful\nsense of deja vu about the place. This is\u2014\n\"Taki?\"\nWhen I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a\nsecond, I forgot she existed.\n\"You know, Taki,\" she says with an even smile, \"you seem like a different\nperson today.\"\nShe executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me\nbehind.\nI blew it.\nAll I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole\nthing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even\nconsider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.\nEven though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I\nshould've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've\nspent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.\nFrom the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi\nbuildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.\nMy eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.\nHer hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,\nshe might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat\ntighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I\ngrope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai?\"\nShe doesn't turn.\n\".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere\u2014\"\n\"Why don't we call it a day instead?\" she suggests with the tone of a patient\nteacher.\n\"Okay.\"\nOn the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-\nsenpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun\n\u2014I can't see it clearly.\n\"Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?\"",

There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,\nand after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on\na real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's\ndisappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it\nthe entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.\nIt feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of\nanything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming\nMitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,\nwe're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound\ntogether the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think\nI'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.\n\"That's why you're not popular, you know. \" \"It's your fault for promising\nstuff without checking first. \"\nI open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.\nThe comet should be visible just about the time\nthe date ends.\nEeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.\nV\nWhether it's me or you, let's do our best on the\ndate!\nComet?\nI look up at the sky. The last traces of the sunset are already gone. A few of\nthe brightest stars are out, and a jet's flying past, humming faintly, but that's it.\nNeedless to say, there's no comet.\n\"What's she talking about?\" I mutter quietly.\nIf a comet people could actually see was passing, it would've been pretty\nbig news. Maybe Mitsuha got mixed up.\nAbruptly, my heart twinges uneasily in its darkest recesses.\nSomething's trying to surface in my mind.\nI flip through the phone and pull up Mitsuha's cell number, staring at those\neleven digits. Back when we first started swapping, I tried calling this number\nseveral times, but for some reason, it never went through. I touch it with a\nfingertip. The \"calling\" sound plays. Then I hear a voice from the speaker:\n\"The number you have dialed is unavailable. Either the number is not in\nservice or the unit is turned off or out of range... \"\nI pull the phone away from my ear and press end call.\nSo calls really don't get through. Well, whatever. I'll just tell her about this\ntrain wreck of a day next time we swap. I'll ask her about the comet, too. We'll\nswitch tomorrow or the day after, anyway. With that thought, I finally descend\nthe pedestrian bridge. There's a pale, smooth half-moon overhead, all alone, as\nif someone forgot it there.",

I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on\nmy phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could\nnever have happened if I'd been myself.

Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn't\nalive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.\nBecause of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.\nSomething might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.\nMaybe there was some sort of accident.

The camera on Tsukasa's phone fires off click after click\nin the little terminal.\n\"You guys are in the way.\"\nAs I glare at the local map posted in the station, I'm even more convinced\nthat these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I'll just have to find her\nmyself.\nThe plan goes like this:\nSince I don't know exactly where Mitsuha's town is, we'll take the train to\na spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we'll\nhave to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew. We'll go around showing\nthe drawings to residents, asking if anyone recognizes them, slowly working\nour way north along the local line. There's a railroad crossing in one of the\nscenes I remember, so following the tracks should work.\nIt's a really vague approach, to the point where I can't really call it a\n\"plan\" at all, but I couldn't think of any other way. Besides, there can't be that\nmany towns built around lakes.

      "text": "Three years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet\nwith a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach\nto Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put\nHalley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4\nbillion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly\nseventy-five thousand miles of Earth\u2014closer than the moon. The tail of this\nshining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first\ntime in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it\nwelcomed Comet Tiamat.\nUntil the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's\nnucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in\ndiameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,\nplummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per\nsecond. Tragically, it struck Japan\u2014a residential area called Itomori.\nThe town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision\noccurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which\nmust have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.\nThe meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The\ndestruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge\nhole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,\nmagnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds\nlater, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater\npart of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the\ntown's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in\nhuman history.\nSince the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,\nultimately creating a gourd-shaped body of water, New Itomori Lake.\nDamage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the\nthousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In\nless than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.\nFourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori\nwas gone.\n\u2014These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.\nThree years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet\nTiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.\n.. .But that's weird.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nI lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.\nThat means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.\nThe comet and my swapping with Mitsuha had nothing to do with each\nother.\nIt'd be normal to think that. It's what I want to think.",

It wasn't a dream!\"\nThe rain has subsided to a drizzle, dripping down my cheeks like tears. I\nscrub roughly at my face with my sleeve, then start down the slope into the\ncaldera.\nIn front of me, what was a little stream in my memories is now a decent-\nsize pond. Is it swollen from the rain, or has enough time passed since that\ndream that the landscape changed? Either way, the great tree stands several\ndozen yards away on the other side.\nThis is the edge of the next world.\nI remember somebody saying that to me once.\nDoes that make this the Sanzu River?\nI step into the water. There's a big, echoing splash, as if I've stuck my foot\ninto a bathtub, and I realize, belatedly, that this basin is unnaturally quiet. The\nheavy water is above my knees, and every step I take makes a loud sloshing\nsound. I start feeling as if I'm tromping all over something pure and white with\nmuddy feet, defiling it. Until I arrived, this place had been perfectly silent. I'm\nnot welcome , I think instinctively. My body heat is being sucked away again,\ninto the cold water. Before long, the water's up to my chest, but I manage to get\nacross somehow.\nThe massive tree stands with its roots twined around a big slab of rock.\nI don't know whether the \"body of the god\" is the tree, the rock, or whether\nthe shape of the two of them tangled together is what people worship. There's\na little stairway in the gap between the roots and the stone, and when I go\ndown it, I find a yawning space wide enough for about four tatami mats.\nThe silence here is even deeper than it was outside.\nI unzip my jacket with freezing hands and take out my phone. I check to\nmake sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single\nmovement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems\ncompletely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.\nThis place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.\nThe tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,\ntwo four-inch urns sit side by side.\n\"It's the sake we carried up here.\"\nGently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold\nanymore.\n\"This is her little sister's...\"\nMy hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick\nit up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put\ndown roots.\n\"And this is the one I brought.\"\nI sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on\nit. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It\nmust have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this\ntime into words.\n. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?\"\nI untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.\n\"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died\nthree years ago when the meteorite fell?\"\nI pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the\nlid.\n\"Half of her...\"\nI bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles\nfloating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.\n\" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then\nreuniting...\"\nI raise the lidful of sake to my lips.\n\"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time...\"\nTake me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound\nis so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it\nhits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.\nBut nothing happens.\nFor a little while, I sit very still.",

The first thing we think of is\nbroadcasting an evacuation order.\nAfter we run through the inevitable ridiculous ideas\u2014 We'll take over the\nprime minister's official residence! Or the Diet Building! Or the NHK\nShibuya Broadcasting Center, or at least the NHK Gifu-Takayama branch\noffice! \u2014we start talking about how not everybody in town will be at home\nwith their TVs or radios on and how even more people will be out and about\nbecause of the autumn festival tonight. Then we fall silent, thinking.\n\".. .The disaster alert system!\" Teshigawara shouts suddenly.\n\"Disaster alert system?\"\n\"Hunh? Don't go tellin' me you don't know. There are speakers all over\ntown, remember?\"\n\"Oh... That thing that starts talking out of the blue every morning and\nevening? Who was born, who's having a funeral, that sort of thing?\"\n\"Yeah. You can hear that all over town for sure, whether you're inside or\nout. If we send the order over that...!\"\n\"Huh? But, uh...how? That comes from the town hall, doesn't it? Would\nthey let us broadcast stuff if we asked?\"\n\"Pssh. No.\"\n\"Then what do we do? Hijack Town Hall? I mean, I guess we'd have a\nbetter shot at that than at taking over NHK, but...\"\n\"Heh-heh-heh.\" With a creepy smile, Teshigawara types something into his\nphone. Geez, this guy looks happy.\n\"We can do this!\"\nHe holds out his phone to me.\nSuperimposed frequencies, it reads, and below is an explanation.\n\"Wha...? Is this for real?\"\nTeshigawara flares his nostrils and nods proudly.\n\"Uh, Tesshi... Why do you even know stuff like this?\"\n\"Well, I always fantasize before I fall asleep, y'know? About destroyin' the\ntown, overthrowin' the school, stuff like that. Doesn't everybody?\"\n\"Huh...?\" That weirds me out a bit. But, no\u2014this is...\n\"This is awesome, Tesshi! It just might work!\"\nWithout thinking, I throw an arm around Teshigawara's shoulders.\n\"H-hey, don't get too close!\"\n\"Huh?\"\nWhoa. Even his ears are red.\n\"What's this? Tesshi, are you embarrassed?\"\nI look up into Teshigawara's face from below, grinning at him. Well, well,\nMitsuha, you're not to be taken lightly, are you? C'mon, c'mon! I press my\nbody against him some more. Here you go\u2014have a freebie! We're sitting side\nby side on an old sofa, and Tesshi's already right by the wall, so he's got\nnowhere to run.\n\"Hey, Mitsuha, cut it out!\"\nTeshigawara resists, big body squirming. He's a guy, for sure... Well, so\nam I. Then, abruptly, Teshigawara jumps up, climbing onto the back of the sofa,\nand yells, \"I told you, knock it off! A single girl your age\u2014that ain't proper!\"\n\"Ha...\"\nEven his buzzed scalp is red. He's sweating bullets, and his eyes look\nalmost teary.\n\"Ha, ha-ha-ha! Tesshi, you're such a...!\"\nIn spite of myself, I crack up laughing.\nHe's a really good guy, and I'm positive I can count on him.\nI thought of him as a friend before, but I'd like to meet him and the others\nfor real and talk to them as a guy soon. Me and Mitsuha and Teshigawara and\nSaya. If Tsukasa and Takagi and Okudera-senpai were there, too, I know it'd\nbe a blast.\n\"Sorry, Tesshi. I was just so happy you believed me...\" I'm biting back\nlaughter, and Teshigawara's sulking. \"Will you help me think up the rest of the\nevacuation plan?\"\nI smile at him Tesshi's face is still red, but even so, he nods seriously.\nOnce this is over, I'll come see this guy, too, I think, feeling a little bit\ndazzled.\n\"A-a-a...a bomb?!\"\nSaya yells. She's eating a mini shortcake from a clear plastic wrapper.\n\"Technically, they're called water-gel explosives. They're kinda like\ndynamite,\" Teshigawara tells her, sounding proud. He's crunching away on\npotato chips, and I'm noshing on chocolate drops. Saya bought a ton of\nconvenience-store food and spread it all over the desk, so it sort of feels like\nwe're having a party.\nTeshigawara and I are standing behind a map, outlining our carefully\nengineered evacuation plan to Saya. I almost want to play some energetic\nmusic to set the stage. Something percussive and a bit unhinged\u2014something\nthat sounds like a strategy meeting.\nTaking a gulp of coffee milk from a pint-size pack, Teshigawara continues.\n\"There's lots of explosives in my dad's company's warehouse, for construction\nstuff. If I don't have to worry about gettin' caught afterward, I can snatch as\nmuch as we need.\"\n\"Then, next,\" I say, opening a melon bread wrapper. I'm really hungry, and\nfor some reason, everything I eat when I'm in Mitsuha's body tastes really\ngood.\n\"Y-y-y.. .you're gonna hijack the signal?!\" Saya's voice cracks.\nMunching on curry bread, Teshigawara explains. \"Rural wireless disaster\nalert systems like ours are easy to take over, as long as you know the\ntransmission frequency and the superimposed wake-up frequency. The\nspeakers are made so they'll activate as long as a specific frequency is layered\nover the audio.\"\nMelon bread in one hand, I pick up where he left off. \"That means we can\nsend the evacuation order all over town from the school broadcasting room.\"\nI point at the map of Itomori. There's a circle with a diameter of a little less\nthan a mile, centered on Miyamizu Shrine, and I trace its edge with my finger.\n\"This is the area that's supposed to take damage from the meteorite. As you\ncan see, Itomori High is outside it.\" I tap on the location of the high school.\n\"In other words, we just need to evacuate people here, to the schoolyard.\"\n\"B-but that's...\" Saya begins stammering nervously. \"That's a full-blown\ncrime!\"\nEven as she says it, she's putting the strawberry\u2014which she saved for last\n\u2014in her mouth.\n\"We'll never get the people around here to move without committing a\ncrime,\" I tell her coolly, sweeping away the chocolate drops I'd scattered over\nthe map. That's right. As long as it gets the people inside this circle to leave, it\ndoesn't matter whether it's a crime or not.\n\"Y'know, Mitsuha, it's like you're a different person.\"\nI grin and take a big bite of melon bread. When I'm in this body, I\nunconsciously start talking a bit like a girl, but I've completely abandoned\ntrying to act like Mitsuha. As long as these guys are still safe when\neverything's over, nothing else matters. As long as we're all alive, things will\nwork out.\n\"...So. You're the one in charge of the broadcast, Saya,\" I tell her\ncheerfully.\n\"Why?!\"\n\"Well, you're in the broadcasting club, right?\"\n\"Plus, your big sis is in charge of the Town Hall broadcast. Get her to tell\nyou the wireless frequency,\" says Teshigawara.\n\"Huh? I can't just...\"\nIgnoring Saya's protest, Teshigawara happily points to himself. \"I'm the\nexplosives guy!\"\n\"And I'm going to go talk to the mayor,\" I say, pointing to myself.\n\"Huh?!\" Saya is speechless, and Teshigawara picks up the explanation.\n\"We can probably set up the evacuation on our own with the plan we just\ntalked about. But if the town hall and firefighters don't come out at the end,\nthere's no way we'll get everybody in all one hundred eighty-eight families to\nmove, y'know?\"",

Since there were no schools along\nthe track, everyone who commuted around here drove.\n'Tmgoin' into Tokyo for a bit.\"\nThis had been Mitsuha's abrupt announcement to her little sister when they\nleft the house that morning.\n\"Huh? Now? Why?!\" Yotsuha asks, startled.\n\"Um... For a date?\"\n\"Wha\u2014?! Sis, you have a boyfriend in Tokyo?!\"\n\"Uh, well... It's not my date.\" Unsure how to explain herself, Mitsuha\nbreaks into a run. \"I'll be back tonight. Don't worry!\"\nGazing at the scenery flying past the window of the bullet train, Mitsuha\nwonders:\nWhy am I crashin ' Okudera-senpai and Takis date? It's not like the three\nof us can just hang out together. Besides, I've never been to Tokyo before.\nWill I even be able to find Taki? Even if I do, will it bother him that I'm\nshowin' up out of the blue? Will he be surprised? Maybe he 'll be upset...\nWith an uncomplicated ease almost inviting disappointment, the Shinkansen\nslides into Tokyo. The incredible crowds leave Mitsuha breathless, but she\ntries calling my cell. \"...Because the unit is out of range or turned off, the\nnumber you are trying to reach is... \" She hangs up. Just like the other calls, it\ndidn't go through.\nI'll never find him, Mitsuha thinks.\nStill, after staring at the station information board like it's a quiz, she heads\ninto the city, relying on her vague memories.\nBut if I do see him...\nShe rides the Yamanote Line, the city bus, walks, takes another train, then\nwalks some more.\nWhat 'll I do? It probably will bother him, right? Maybe it 'll be awkward.\nOr maybe \u2014\nShe sees the words Comet Tiamat at Closest Point Tomorrow on a big\noutdoor TV screen.\nOr, if I do find him, just maybe, will he\u2014?\nTired from walking, she gazes at the sparkling lights of the buildings from a\npedestrian bridge and thinks, almost praying:\nIf I find Taki, maybe he 'll be just a little bit happy...\nShe starts walking again, still thinking.\nI'll never find him searchin ' randomly like this. I won't, but I know one\nthing for sure. If we meet, we 'll know right away. \"You 're the one who was in\nme. I'm the one who was in you. \"\nMitsuha's certain of this, as if it's as simple as two plus two.\nThe evening sun sinks through the gap between the station platform roofs, as\nweak as a dying flashlight.\nMitsuha's feet are sore from all the walking she's done, and she plants\nherself on a bench with her legs kicked out in front of her. She stares absently\nat the setting sun, which is much paler and less reliable than in Itomori.\nA musical chime plays, and a voice announces: \"The local train to...\nChiba...is arriving on... Track Four. \" A yellow train glides onto the platform.\nThe cars kick up a warm wind that ruffles her hair. Mitsuha gazes at the train\nwindows without really seeing them.\nAbruptly, her breath catches.\nShe jumps to her feet as if she's been stung.\nHe 'd been there, in the window that had just passed in front of her.\nMitsuha breaks into a sprint. The cars have stopped, and she catches up to\nthe window almost immediately. The evening train is crowded, though, and she\ncan't find him again from outside. With a sound like a giant exhalation, the\ndoors open. The car's so tightly packed that the people are practically spilling\nout, making Mitsuha shiver. Even so\u2014murmuring \"Excuse me\" and sweating\nbehind the knees\u2014she pushes her way into the crowd. With another giant sigh,\nthe doors close. The train begins moving. Repeating \"Excuse me\" over and\nover, little by little, Mitsuha works her way forward. Then, in front of one boy,\nshe stops. The sounds around her vanish.\nIt's me. The middle school \"me\" from three years ago.\n+ + +\nI can't go any higher on the bike.\nNo sooner have I had the thought than the front wheel catches on a root, and\nI slip.\nOn reflex, I grab the trunk of a nearby tree. The bike slips out from under\nme and tumbles down the slope, hitting the ground about ten feet below with a\nhuge racket. The wheels are bent all out of shape. \"Sorry, Teshigawara,\" I\nmutter softly, and I take off running up the narrow mountain track.\nWhy did I forget? Why didn't I remember until just now?\nAs I run, I stare at the memories welling up inside me.\nMitsuha, that day, three years ago, you came to see me\u2014\n+ +\nTaki. Taki, Taki.\nFor a while now, Mitsuha has been silently rolling my name around on her\ntongue. I haven't noticed her at all, even though I'm right in front of her. She\nkeeps fretting over what tone she should use to address me and what\nexpression she should wear, so earnestly she seems liable to burst into tears.\nThen, forcing a bright smile, she says:\n\"Taki.\"\nThe middle school me is startled hearing my name out of the blue, and I\nglance up. We're still about the same height, so her big, vaguely teary eyes are\nright in front of me.\n\"Huh...?\"\n\"Um, do you...\"\nSmiling desperately, Mitsuha points to herself. I'm bewildered.\n\"...Huh?\"\n\"Don't you remember me?\" asks this stranger, timidly, looking at me\nthrough her lashes.\n\"Who're you?\"\nMitsuha gives a small, breathy shriek, then quickly turns red. She lowers\nher eyes, speaking in a voice that's barely audible.\n\"Oh... I'm sorry...\"\nThe train sways. The passengers all adjust to keep their balance, except for\nMitsuha, who staggers into me. Her hair brushes the tip of my nose, and I catch\nthe faint scent of shampoo. \"I'm sorry,\" she mumbles again.\nWeird girl , thinks middle school me.\nMitsuha's muddled mind races desperately. But you're Taki, so why...? For\nboth of us, time passes awkwardly.\n\"The next station is ...Yotsuya. \" The announcement offers Mitsuha a bit of\nrelief. At the same time, though, she feels unbearably sad. Still, she can't stay\nhere any longer. The doors open, and she moves with the rest of the crowd to\nexit the train.\nWatching her receding back, I suddenly think, Maybe this weird girl is\nsomebody I should know. This inexplicable, intense impulse drives me to call\nout.\n\"'Scuse me! What's your name?\"\nMitsuha turns back, but the waves of disembarking passengers push her\nfarther away. Hurriedly, she undoes the braided cord tying back her hair. She\nholds it out to me and shouts:\n\"Mitsuha!\"\nWithout thinking, I reach for it. It's a vivid orange, like a thin ray of evening\nsun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that color tight.\n\"My name is Mitsuha!\"\n^ +\nThat day, three years ago, you came to see me.\nFinally, I know.\nA girl I didn't recognize spoke to me on the train once. To me, that was all\nit'd been, and I completely forgot about it. But Mitsuha had come to Tokyo\ncarrying the weight of all those feelings, had been hurt badly, gone back to her\nown town, and cut her hair.",

I try stabbing it in like a needle,\nto carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an\ninch. My lips move.\n\"...Who are you?\"\nThe pen falls from my hand.\nThey're vanishing. Your name.

In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all\nthat stays with me. I'll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone's forced\nme to take.\nFine, I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is\nloneliness, I'll still live with everything I've got. Even if this emotion is all I\nhave, I'll keep struggling. Even if we're separated, even if we never meet\nagain, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting\nresolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll\nforget even the fact that I've forgotten something.\nAnd so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky\none last time:\n\"What's your name?\"\nThe cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains.

We're heading for an area between the slopes of the\nmountains, where the lights are concentrated: Miyamizu Shrine, the site of the\nautumn festival. Out of nowhere, I feel an odd nostalgia, as if I've come back\nhome after a long time away.\n\"Mitsuha, she wants to talk to you.\"\n\"Hello?

Saya!\"\nI start getting nervous.\nAbruptly, I hear a tiny voice. \"Okay! Agh, I don't even care anymore! You\ntell Tesshi he better buy me somethin', too!\"\n\"What'd she say?\"\nPutting the smartphone in my skirt pocket, I yell back loud enough to be\nheard over the moped's engine. \"That you better buy her somethin', too!\"\n\"Awright, let's do this!\"\nTesshi shouts determinedly, as if trying to suppress something, and just then,\nbehind us, there's a bang like a big firework bursting.\nWe stop the moped and look back. Two, three. One more. The explosions\necho one after another, and hallway up the mountain\u2014where we were just a\nfew minutes ago\u2014thick black smoke is rising. In slow motion, an enormous\ntransmission tower begins tilting.\n\"Tesshi...!\"\nMy voice quavers.\n\"Ha-ha!\"\nTesshi's breath is shaky, too. It sounds like a laugh.\nThere's an even bigger explosion, and the lights of the town instantly go\ndark.\n\"Hey,\" Tesshi intones, sounding kind of dazed.\n\"The power's out,\" I say, stating the obvious.\nIt worked. We did it.\nSuddenly, sirens well up, beginning to wail.\n000OOOOOOOO000000...!\nThe earsplitting noise reverberates from speakers all over town. It's an\nominous sound, like a giant's scream, and it ricochets off the mountains,\npervading the area.\nIt's Saya. She's hijacked the wireless disaster prevention system\nWe exchange wordless nods, then straddle the moped again. As we race\ntoward the shrine, the speakers broadcasting Saya's voice spur us on. Slowly,\ncalmly, as if her earlier tearful cries were fake, she delivers the message we\ncame up with:\n\"This is Town Hall. An explosion has occurred at Itomori Substation.\nThere is a danger of further explosions and forest fires.\"\nTesshi's moped goes off the prefectural road and climbs up a narrow\nmountain track. It's the gentler slope up to the shrine\u2014this way, we can take\nthe moped all the way to the back of the main building and avoid the stone\nstairs on the shrine approach. The seat shakes violently, and I cling to Tesshi's\nback as I listen to Saya's voice booming through the town. She sounds exactly\nlike her big sister.

Job hunting, hmm?\"\nOkudera-senpai looks up from her phone, sees me in my suit, and smiles.\nIt's evening, and the area in front of Yotsuya Station is filled with the faintly\nlanguid hum of people released from their days at work or school.\n\"Ha-ha. Well, it's not going so great.\"\n\"Hmm...\" Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She\ninspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, \"You don't\nthink it's because suits don't look good on you?\"\n\"I-is it really that bad?!\" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.\n\"Oh, come on, I'mjoking!\"\nOkudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.\n\"Let's walk a little,\" Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,\ngoing against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut\nacross Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that\nthe trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass\nhave on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,\ntoo.\n\"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue.\"\nFeeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to\nOkudera-senpai beside me.\n\"What?\" Her glossy lips pout. \"I can't get in touch with you without a\nreason?\"\n\"No, no, no!\" I wave my hands hastily.\n\"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time.\"\n\"Y-yes. I am.\"\nShe smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. \"I was in the area\nfor work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki.\" She was hired by a major\nclothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. \"Life in the suburbs\nis fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind,\" she tells me, gazing at\nher surroundings like she's a little awestruck. \"Look,\" she says suddenly, and I\nraise my head.\nWe're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant\noutdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage\nof gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster\u2014Eight\nYears Later in big letters.\n\"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?\" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,\nas though she's searching distant memories. \"You were still in high school,\nTaki, so it must've been...\"\n\"Five years ago, maybe?\" I finish the sentence for her.\n\"That long...\" She exhales a little, as if surprised. \"I'm forgetting all sorts\nof things.\"\nShe's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk\nup Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I\ntry remembering that day.\nIt was the summer of my second year in high school\u2014 No, it was just about\nthis time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short\ntrip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way\nto Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.\nRight, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the\nside of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur\nand grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a\nvague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed\na mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to\nTokyo by myself the next day.\nThat's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that\ncomet.\nIn the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human\nhistory, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,\nalmost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the\ncomet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and\nmost of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.\nIt was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all\nsorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical\nphenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the\nmedia's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around\nwildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit\nwith Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or\nquestioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an\nevacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been\nforetold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so\nisolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the\npower across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite\nstrike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the\nprograms to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as\nwith most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of\nItomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.\nStill... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of\nItomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had\nmaterialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had\nvisited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.\nWhat in the world had it been?\nWell, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink\ninto the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I\nwrite the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job\nnext year, not ancient history I don't really remember.\n\"The wind's come up,\" Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair\nrises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,\nreaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a\nmelancholy inside me.\n\"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough,\" Okudera-senpai\nsays when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.",

My\nwhole body trembles slightly.\nI finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into\ntears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.\nEven as I cry, I smile, too.
