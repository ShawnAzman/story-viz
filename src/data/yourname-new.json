I can't show weakness by\napologizing! I think, opening the rice cooker and scooping a gleaming white\nhelping into my bowl. Whoops, is that too much? Well, never mind.\n\"Thanks for the food!\"\nI pour a generous dose of sauce over a smooth fried egg, pair it with rice,\nand put it in my mouth. Oh, yum. This just might be paradise... Hmm? I feel\neyes trained on me, somewhere around my temple.\n\"So you're normal today, are you?\"\n\"Huh?\"\nGran is watching me steadily as I chew my food.\n\"She sure was somethin' else yesterday!\" Yotsuha smirks at me. \"Screamin'\nall of a sudden like that.\"\nScreaming? Gran inspects me suspiciously, and Yotsuha grins (mocking me,\nI'm sure).\n\"Huh? What? What do you mean? What?!\"\nSeriously, what's the matter with them? It's creepy.\nDing-dong-ding-do oong.\nSuddenly, the speaker over the door comes alive, deafeningly loud.\n\"Good morning, everyone.\"\nThe voice belongs to my friend Saya's big sister (currently employed by the\nRegional Life Information Section at the town hall). This place, Itomori, is a\ndinky little town with a population of fifteen hundred, so most people either\nknow each other or at least know someone in common.\n\"Here are the morning announcements from Itomori.\"\nThe slow stream of words from the speaker is clipped into phrases. \"Here\nare...the morning anno uncements... from Itomori.\" There are speakers\noutside, too, all over town, so the broadcast echoes off the mountains and\noverlaps with itself as if it's being sung in rounds.\nTwice a day, morning and evening, this disaster-prevention radio broadcast\nplays throughout the town. Every house has a receiver to faithfully relay the\ndaily announcements about local events: the schedule for the sports meet, how\nto contact whoever's in charge of shoveling the snow, yesterday's births,\ntoday's funerals.\n\"With regard to the Itomori mayoral election, which will take place on\nthe twentieth of next month, the town election management committee\nhas\u2014\"\nClick.\nThe speaker over the lintel falls silent. Gran can't reach it herself, so she's\npulled the plug. She's past eighty and wearing her usual traditional kimono, but\neven so, the gesture wordlessly conveys her anger. Even as I'm impressed by\nher chilly ire, I grab up the remote and turn on the TV without missing a beat.\nPicking up where Saya's sister left off, the smiling NHK news lady starts\nspeaking.\n\"We're now just a month away from a visit by a comet that appears only\nonce every twelve hundred years. For a few days, the comet is expected to be\nvisible to the naked eye. With the celestial show of the century just around the\ncorner, JAXA and research institutes worldwide are scrambling in preparation\nto study it.\"\nThere's a line of text on the screen \u2014Comet Tiamat visible to the naked\neye next month \u2014and a blurry picture of a comet. Our conversation has lost its\nmomentum, and the only noise comes from the three of us taking our meal and\nthe NHK broadcast. Our soft clinks and clicks sound a bit guilty, like\nwhispered chatter during class.\n\"... Just make up with him already, wouldja?\"\nOut of nowhere, Yotsuha says something tactless.\n\"It's an adult problem,\" I snap at her.\nThat's right\u2014this is an adult problem. Stupid election! Somewhere in the\nwind, a black kite gives a rather silly-sounding cry: Piiihyororo.\nSaying bye to Gran in unison, Yotsuha and I head out the door.",

Don't be stingy!\"\n\"C'mon, you're heavy.\"\n\"And you're rude!\"\nThis early in the morning, and they're already teasing each other like a\nmarried couple in a comedy skit.\n\"You two get along so well.\"\n\"We do not!\" they chorus.\nThey deny it so earnestly it's funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack\nswitches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a\ngood ten years\u2014petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and\ntall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look\nlike they're fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly\nsynced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.\n\"Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today.\"\nSaya, who's gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,\ngrinning. My hair's fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied\ntogether in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.\n\"Huh? What about my hair?\"\nHer comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in\nthe shuffle at breakfast. I did it \"properly\" today\u2014does that mean it was weird\nyesterday? As I'm trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking\nconcerned. \"Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn't you?\"\n\"Exorcise?\"\n\"Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!\"\n\".. .Excuse me?\" I frown at the unexpected remark.\nSaya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. \"Would you quit blamin'\neverythin' on the occult already?! Mitsuha's probably just stressed, that's all.\nRight?\"\nStressed?\n\"Huh? Wait, hold it\u2014what's all this about?\"\nWhy is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can't\nremember off the top of my head, but I'm pretty sure it was just a regular day.\n...Hmm?\nWait, was it really? Yesterday, I...\n\"\u2014And most importantly!\"\nA deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.\nOn the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little\ncrowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal\nparking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and\nbolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit\njacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent\u2014Toshiki Miyamizu. He's stumping for\nthe mayoral election.\n\"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the\nvillage restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we\nbe able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I\nintend to refine the community planning I've been involved with and see it\nthrough to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,\ncreating a local society in which everyone\u2014from our children to our senior\ncitizens\u2014can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my\nresolve to make this vision my goal...\"\nIt's such a skillful speech that it's almost overbearing. It leaves me cold\u2014\nthis campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot\nsurrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd\u2014 \"You know it's\ngonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, \" \"It sounds like he s been\nspreadin ' lots of cash around\" \u2014make my mood even darker.\n\"Hey, Miyamizu.\"\n\"...Mornin'.\"\nWonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I'm less than fond of.\nEven in high school, they're part of the flashy \"in-crowd,\" and they snark at us\n\u2014the \"drones\"\u2014over every little thing.\n\"The mayor and the contractor,\" one of them says, shooting a deliberate\nglance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi's dad standing next\nto mine, beaming. He's wearing a jacket from his construction company and an\narmband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.\nThe guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. \"Their kids are all\nbuddy-buddy, too. Did your folks tell you to hang out together?\"\nThis is so stupid. I don't even answer\u2014I walk faster, trying to get out of\nthere. Tesshi's expressionless.

This is the origin of the term tasogare, or\ntwilight. You know the word twilight, don't you?\"\nSpeaking in a clear voice, our teacher, Miss Yuki, writes Tasokare in big\nletters on the blackboard.\n\"It's evening, not quite day or night. It's a window when outlines blur,\nmaking it hard to tell who people are. When you might meet something that\nisn't human. It's a time when people encounter demons or the dead, and it has\nanother name that reflects this. They say, though, that even before that, it had\nother names.\"\nMiss Yuki writes the two terms on the board, but it looks like she's just\nshuffling around the same letters.\n\"'Scuse me, teacher! Question! What about half-lightl \"\nSomebody speaks up, and I think, Yeah, that's right. I know twilight, of\ncourse, but the word I've heard people use to mean evening ever since I was\nlittle is half-light. When Miss Yuki hears this, she smiles gently. You know,\nour classics teacher is much too pretty to be teaching at a country high school\nlike this.\n\"I expect that's local dialect, isn't it? I hear the elderly people in Itomori\nstill use ancient Japanese words here and there.\"\n\"'Cause this here's the sticks,\" proclaims one of the boys, and people start\ngiggling. He's not wrong. Sometimes Gran uses words that make me want to\nask her what language she's speaking. Some of her expressions were\nabandoned by most of the rest of Japan a couple of centuries back. Idly\npondering, I flip through my notebook, and then\u2014on a page that should be\nblank\u2014I see something written in big letters:\nWho are you?\n...Huh?\nWhat is this? The sounds around me fade and grow distant, as if being\nabsorbed by the unfamiliar handwriting. That's not mine. I haven't lent my\nnotebook to anybody, either. What? \"Who am I?\" What's that supposed to\nmean?\n\"...zu. You're next, Miss Miyamizu!\"\n\"Oh! Yes'm!\" I stand up hastily.\n\"Begin reading on page ninety-eight, please,\" Miss Yuki tells me.\nScrutinizing my face, she adds, sounding amused, \"Good to see that you\nremember your name today, Miss Miyamizu.\"\nAt that, the whole class bursts out laughing. Excuse me? Seriously, what is\ngoing on?!\n\"You don't remember?\"\n\"...No.\"\n\"For real?\"\n\"Yes, for real,\" I answer, taking a sip of banana juice. Gulp. Yum. Saya's\nlooking at me as if I'm some inanimate oddity.\n\".. .No, listen. Yesterday, you forgot where your desk and your locker were.\nYour hair was all mussed and cowlicky, and you hadn't tied it back. You didn't\nwear your uniform ribbon, and you were crabby the whole time.\"\nI try visualizing what that must've looked like.What?\n\"What?! No way, are you serious?!\"",

On this day,\nwe wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear\njingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura\nhall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It's one of the traditions whose\nmeaning was lost in the fire, and it's performed by two people, moving in sync.\nWe're both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,\ntwirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.\nDuring my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and\ngot even more depressed. Those little\u2014 I told them and told them not to come,\nand they're still here?! I'll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I'll text\nthem tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn't the part I hate.\nSure, it's a little embarrassing, but since I've been doing it since I was little,\nI'm completely used to it. No, it's not this. It's that one ritual. The one that's\nmore embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The\npart that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.\nOh, for the love of\u2014\nI don't wanna!\nPlagued by these thoughts, I move my body, and then all of a sudden, the\ndance ends. Agh. Here it comes.\nMunch, munch, munch.\nMunch.\nMunch, munch, munch, munch.\nI'm intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to\nthink, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha's doing\nthe exact same thing. We're kneeling formally, side by side, and a small\nwooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,\na diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.\nMunch, munch, munch.\nMunch, munch.\nAgh, I swear...\nMunch, munch, munch.\nI'm going to have to do it soon.\nMunch, munch.\nArrrgh.\nMunch.\nGiving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,\nattempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.\nAnd then. Aaagh.\nPuckering my lips, I spit the rice I've been chewing into the box. The\nmixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I\nfeel as if I've heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.\nPlease, nobody look at me.\nMouth-brewed sake.\nIt's the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with\nsaliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it's offered to\nthe gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I\ndon't know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first\ncentury...

He\ngoes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she's got\nseniority on me. Okay!\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really...\"\n\"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn't you?\"\nAs she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes\ncurve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of\nbeauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel\ncompelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look\ndown.\n\"Uh, no, it wasn't really 'rough,' just...\"\n\"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let\nhim have his food for free, but...\"\nShe doesn't seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping\ndown another table. Just as I'm about to try to prolong the conversation...\n\"Eek! Okudera-senpai!\"\nAnother waitress cries out.\n\"Your skirt!\"\n\"Hmm?\"\nMiss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now\nthat I'm looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a\nshocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.\n\"Are you hurt?\"\n\"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?\"\n\"I think something like that's happened before...\"\n\"Was someone harassing you?\"\n\"Do you remember the guy's face?\"\nSeveral staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.\nEyes downcast, she's gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the\nwords I'd prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I\nsee little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.\nThis time, I need to rescue her.\nThe thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I'm doing,\nI've grabbed Okudera-senpai's hand and started walking. I hear voices at my\nback (\"Hey! Taki, you little...\"), but I ignore them.\nThe green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at\nleast one more design element. The brown is\u2014 Sure, it'll be a hedgehog. The\ncream is for its nose.\nPinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For\nsome reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing\nroom sewing kit, so I'm taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate\nrepair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it's something I'm particularly\ngood at.\n\"All done!\"\nI hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It's only taken me about five minutes to\nfinish.\n\"...Huh? This is...\"\nThe dubious expression she's worn since I dragged her to the dressing\nroom quickly shifts to surprise.\n\"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It's even cuter than it was before!\"\nThe tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so\nas I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.\nThe skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought\nbeing a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like\nOkudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but\nwhen she smiles, she's more approachable, like an older girl from the\nneighborhood.\n\"You really saved me today. Thank you very much.\"\nI finally managed to say it.\n\"Heh-heh!\" Okudera-senpai's large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.\n\"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You're weak, Taki, but\nyou're always so quick to fight.\"\nAs she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I\ngrasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana's face.\n\"I like this version of you better,\" Okudera-senpai says, a bit\nmischievously. \"You're surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki.\"\nMy heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing. Her smile is absolutely unbeatable. It\nmakes me want to give her everything I have for free. I think it's the most",

I swallow hard, and the three of them start in on me in menacing tones.\n\"Taki, you scumbag, whaddaya think you're doing, getting a jump on us?\"\n\"You'd better have an excuse, weasel.\" \"You two left together yesterday,\ndidn't you?\"\n\"Huh... Wait, no way\u2014seriously?! I did? With Okudera-senpai?!\"\nMeaning that journal entry was real?!\n\"What happened with you two after that?!\"\n\"Uh, no, I.. .1 really don't remember much...\"\n\"Don't gimme that crap!\"\nJust as it looks like somebody's gonna haul me up by my shirtfront, a cool\nvoice echoes through the hall.\n\"Okudera, reporting for duty.\"\nOkudera-senpai arrives, her long, bare legs and the shoulders peeking out\nof her top gleaming in the light. She greets us with a smile, strappy sandals\nclicking pleasantly.\n\"Hello, everyone.\"\n\"Hi!\"\nShe's sort of an idol at this place, and confronted with her stunning\npresence, the four of us reply in unison. For a moment, we almost forget about\nour problem. Then Okudera-senpai turns back and looks right at me.\n\"Let's make it another good day. Okay, Taki?\"\nI can almost hear a heart symbol punctuating that sentence, so sweetly\ndelivered, followed by a wink sent my way before she disappears through the\ndoor. I turn so red, it's like somebody dumped boiling water over my head.\nThis is way too much. I want to go polish all the glasses in the restaurant until\nthey shine, right this minute.\n\".Hey. Taki.\"\nThe guys' voices are so dark it's as though they're resounding from the\ndepths of the Earth, and I come back to myself with a jolt.\n\u2014Not good. As the senior staff cross-examines me, almost wailing, I\nwonder:\nWhat's going on here? Are they pranking me? Is everybody in on it? ...\nNah, couldn't be. What'd I do while I was out of it?\nWhat the heck is \"Mitsuha \"?\nThe birds are energetically twittering away again this morning. There's a\nnewborn clarity to the early sun that streams in through the paper sliding doors,\nand the morning is peaceful, as usual. Even so, although I've just woken up,\nunfamiliar writing with a quality of pure, concentrated irritation is scrawled\nacross my arm.\nMitsuha??? What are you? Who are you????",

      "text": "Date with Okudera-senpai in Roppongi\ntomorrow! She'll be waiting in front of Yotsuya\nStation at 10:30. It's a date I want to go on, but\nif I'm unlucky and it ends up being you, be\ngrateful and enjoy it.\nFortunately, the place where we're meeting is nearby. I sprint flat out and\narrive with ten minutes to spare. As I catch my breath, I check my phone to\nmake sure. Okudera-senpai might not be here yet. Even though it's a weekend\nmorning, the area around the station is still pretty lively.\nI wipe away my sweat, straighten my jacket collar, and mutter \"Mitsuha,\nyou idiot\" three times. Then, just in case, I start looking for Okudera-senpai.\n...I'm on a date with the Okudera-senpai. Not only that, but as it happens,\nthis is my first date ever. A first date with Okudera-senpai, who's like an idol,\nor an actress, or Miss Japan? Yeah, that's setting the bar fiendishly high.\nMitsuha, you moron. It's not too late yet, so I'm begging you, switch places\nwith me!\n\"Taaaki!\"\n\"Waugh!\"\nA voice startles me from behind, and I give a really lame yell. Hastily, I\nturn around.\n\"Sorry. Did I keep you waiting?\"\n\"No, I wasn't waiting! Uh, I mean, yes, I was! Or, no...\"\nWhat's with that question?! If I tell her I waited, I might make her feel bad,\nand if I tell her I wasn't waiting, I risk making her think I was late. Aaagh,\nwhat's the right answer?\n\"Urn, I, er...\"\nFlustered, I lookup. Okudera-senpai is standing right there, smiling at me.\nMy eyes go wide. She's in black mules, a white flared miniskirt, and a\nblack off-the-shoulder blouse. The monochrome outfit leaves her shoulders and\nlegs dazzlingly exposed, and several gold accessories have been placed\nstrategically, as if placing a careful seal on the charms of her skin. There's a\nlarge mocha-colored ribbon on her small white hat.\nShe looks incredibly sophisticated and incredibly pretty.\n\"...I just got here.\"\n\"Oh, good!\" she laughs, sounding chipper.\n\"Shall we?\"\nShe takes my arm... Ah, for a moment\u2014just a moment\u2014your breast\ntouched my arm. I have a sudden, immediate urge to polish every window in\nthis town.\n\"The conversation keeps dying...\"\nIn the bathroom, I'm hanging my head real, real low. I feel like smashing it\nagainst the mirror.\nThree hours into the date, and I'm already more exhausted than I've ever\nbeen in my life. I had no idea I was this bad with girls. No, that's not it. I hope\nthat's not it. It's all Mitsuha's fault for throwing me into this situation\nunprepared. And more than anything, it's Okudera-senpai's fault for being too\npretty.\nI mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.\nThen they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they're\nthinking, What's that little punk doing there? That's what it looks like to me,\nanyway.\nWell, sure. Even I know I'm out of my league. Look, I didn't ask her out! I\nwant to go around grabbing people's shoulders and making excuses for myself.\nConsequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can\ntell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely\nuncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It's a vicious cycle.\nDammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!\nHoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha's memo.\n...That said, I bet you've never been on a date before.\nAnd so, below, I've put together a collection of handpicked\nlinks, just for you!\n\"Whoa, seriously?!\"\nLook at that! She's practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them\nfor dear life.\nLink 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a\ncommunication disorder\nLink 2: Conversation skills for the person who's never, ever\nbeen the tiniest bit popular!\nLink 3: \\bu won't make 'em sick anymore! A feature on\ntexts they'll love\n.. .Somehow I get the feeling she's selling me way, way short.\nWalking through the art museum, I'm finally feeling a little relieved.\nI'm not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled\nNostalgia, but it's great to be somewhere it isn't weird not to talk. Okudera-\nsenpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.\nFurano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is\ndivided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don't\nknow the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can\nmake out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it's\nsummer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem\noddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you\ngo. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. \"Shibuya\nand Ikebukuro,\" for example, or \"Akasaka and Kichijouji,\" or \"Meguro and\nTachikawa.\"\nEven so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.\nThis one is different from the others.\nWell, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place\u2014the contours\nof the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red\nshrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick\nout your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I\nnever actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations\nwhen I was a kid, but that's what this feels like. I'm having a surreal, powerful\nsense of deja vu about the place. This is\u2014\n\"Taki?\"\nWhen I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a\nsecond, I forgot she existed.\n\"You know, Taki,\" she says with an even smile, \"you seem like a different\nperson today.\"\nShe executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me\nbehind.\nI blew it.\nAll I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole\nthing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn't even\nconsider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.\nEven though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who'd invited her. Even though I\nshould've been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I've\nspent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.\nFrom the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi\nbuildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.\nMy eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She's not saying a word.\nHer hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,\nshe might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat\ntighten. I feel like the oxygen's suddenly thinned, and it's hard to breathe. I\ngrope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai?\"\nShe doesn't turn.\n\".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere\u2014\"\n\"Why don't we call it a day instead?\" she suggests with the tone of a patient\nteacher.\n\"Okay.\"\nOn the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-\nsenpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun\n\u2014I can't see it clearly.\n\"Taki... Forgive me if I'm wrong, all right?\"\n\"Sure.\"\n\"A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn't you?\"\n\"Huh?!\" She knew?! How?!\n\"And now there's someone else you like, isn't there?\"\n\"Huuuuuuuh?!\" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical\nrain forest. \"N-no, there isn't!\"\n\"Really?\"\n\"Th-there isn't! There's absolutely nobody like that!\"\n\"I wonder...\"\nOkudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,\nthere's nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn't. Just for a moment, her long\nhair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost\nimmediately.\n\"Well, never mind.\"\nHer tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.\n\"Huh?\"\n\"Thank you for today. I'll see you at work.\"\nOkudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me\nbehind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no\nwords come out, and while I'm doing that, Okudera-senpai's back descends\nfrom the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.\nI gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I've been abandoned on the edge of\nsummer. There are no breaks in the cars streaming under the pedestrian bridge,\nand after I've been listening to them for a while, I start feeling as though I'm on\na real bridge, over a river. The late sun is as weak as a flashlight, and it's\ndisappearing behind the water tank on top of a mixed-use building. I focus on it\nthe entire time, intently, as if trying to reclaim something.\nIt feels like there are other things I should be doing, but I can't think of\nanything specific. I just want to go to Mitsuha's town again, fast. Becoming\nMitsuha means talking to her, too. When we're swapped, at the same time,\nwe're connected in some special way. We're trading experiences. We're bound\ntogether the way her grandma was talking about. If I turn into Mitsuha, I think\nI'll be able to talk about what happened today. I want to joke around with her.\n\"That's why you're not popular, you know. \" \"It's your fault for promising\nstuff without checking first. \"\nI open the memo on my phone. There's more to Mitsuha's note.\nThe comet should be visible just about the time\nthe date ends.\nEeeeee, how romantic! I can't wait for tomorrow.\nV\nWhether it's me or you, let's do our best on the\ndate!\nComet?",

No matter how much thought I gave it, I couldn't figure out why.\nAfter several weeks, it got harder to shake the suspicion they might just have\nbeen a string of extremely vivid dreams.\nI've got proof, though. I can't believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on\nmy phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could\nnever have happened if I'd been myself.

Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn't\nalive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.\nBecause of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.\nSomething might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.\nMaybe there was some sort of accident. Even if I'm overthinking things, at the\nvery least, she's bound to be worried about the situation, too. That's why I\ndecided to go see her in person. But...\n. .Excuse me?

When the\nlady wearing a triangular kerchief told us, \"C'mon in,\" her smile seemed a\nbeacon, not unlike the appearance of a long-awaited search party when you're\nlost.\nThe ramen's good, too.

The sun's just\nbarely caught on the edge of the mountains, shining peacefully over the fields\nalong the prefectural highway.\n\"I can't explain it, but it's starting to feel like I'm on the wrong track,\" I\nmutter, half to myself. It might be better to go back to Tokyo and rework my\nstrategy. It would be one thing if I had photos, but expecting to find the town\nwith sketches like these might have been asking too much. At least, that's how\nit starts to seem when I pick up my sketchbook and gaze at it. It's a completely\nordinary country town, with the sort of houses you see everywhere scattered\naround a round lake. Even though it felt so solid to me when I finished drawing\nit, it looks like an anonymous, mediocre landscape now.\n\"That's old Itomori, ain't it?\"\n\"Huh?\" I turn around and see the lady's apron.

Hon, c'mere a sec!\"\nThe woman shouts back toward the kitchen. The three of us watch her,\nmouths agape.\nThe ramen shop owner comes out of the kitchen and considers the sketch,\nsmiling a little. \"Oh, yeah. That was Itomori, for sure. Takes me back...\"\n\"My man's from Itomori, you see.\"\nItomori?\nSuddenly, I remember. I start up out of my chair.\n\"Itomori... Yeah, Itomori! Of course, why couldn't I remember that?

      "text": "\"Three years ago...she died?\"\nAbruptly, I remember.\nThe comet I saw over Tokyo three years earlier. Countless shooting stars\nfalling through the western sky. I thought it was beautiful, like something out of\na dream. I got all excited about it.\nThat's when she died?\nDon't.\nI can't acknowledge that.\nI search for words. For proof.\n\"That can't be true... I mean, look, I've got the journal entries she wrote.\"\nI retrieve my phone out of my pocket. Spurred on by the inane fear that the\nbattery will die forever if I take too long, I flip through it in a panic and pull up\nMitsuha's journal entries. They're really there.\nI rub my eyes, hard. For a moment, the letters seemed to writhe.\n\"Wha...?\"\nFirst one letter, then another.\nThe words Mitsuha wrote begin dissolving into meaningless symbols.\nBefore long, the text flickers like a candle flame, and then it's gone. One by\none, her entries disappear entirely. It's as though an invisible man is holding\ndown delete. As I watch, all her sentences vanish.\n\"Why...?\" I ask very quietly.\nThe kite's cry echoes again, high and distant.\nThree years ago in October, right around this time of year, Tiamat, a comet\nwith a solar orbital period of twelve hundred years, made its closest approach\nto Earth. It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put\nHalley's Comet's seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4\nbillion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly\nseventy-five thousand miles of Earth\u2014closer than the moon. The tail of this\nshining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first\ntime in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it\nwelcomed Comet Tiamat.\nUntil the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet's\nnucleus would split in Earth's vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in\ndiameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,\nplummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per\nsecond. Tragically, it struck Japan\u2014a residential area called Itomori.\nThe town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision\noccurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which\nmust have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.\nThe meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The\ndestruction wasn't limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge\nhole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,\nmagnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds\nlater, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater\npart of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the\ntown's population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in\nhuman history.\nSince the crater had formed right beside Itomori Lake, water rushed in,\nultimately creating a gourd-shaped body of water, New Itomori Lake.\nDamage to the southern side of the town was relatively light, but even the\nthousand or so residents who escaped injury moved away, one after another. In\nless than a year, the town was having trouble functioning as a municipality.\nFourteen months after the meteorite fell, for all intents and purposes, Itomori\nwas gone.\n\u2014These are textbook facts, and of course, I knew most of them already.\nThree years ago, I was in middle school. I remember actually watching Comet\nTiamat from a hill in my neighborhood.\n.. .But that's weird.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nI lived in Itomori as Mitsuha, several times, right up until last month.\nThat means that what I saw, the place where she lived, wasn't Itomori.\nThe comet and my swapping with Mitsuha had nothing to do with each\nother.\nIt'd be normal to think that. It's what I want to think.\nHowever, paging through books in this city library near Itomori, I'm\nhopelessly confused. For a while now, in the deepest corner of my mind,\nsomeone's been whispering, This is where you were.\nVanished Itomori\u2014Complete Records\nItomori\u2014The Village That Sank in a Night\nThe Tragedy of Comet Tiamat\nI flip through tome after tome with titles like these. The photos of bygone\ndays in Itomori unmistakably show places I've been. This is the grade school\nYotsuha goes to. Miyamizu Shrine is where their grandma is the chief priestess.\nThis pointlessly big parking lot, the two snack bars right next to each other, the\nconvenience store that looks like a barn, the little railroad crossing on the\nmountain road, and of course Itomori High School... At this point, I recognize\nall of them clearly. Seeing those ruined streets with my own eyes has\nsharpened my memories.\nIt's hard to breathe. My heart is struggling, beating irregularly, and refuses\nto calm down.\nIt feels as though the vivid photos are silently absorbing the air and any\nsense of reality.\nItomori High\u2014Final Sports Festival\nThe photo above the caption shows high schoolers in the middle of a three-\nlegged race. The pair on the end seems familiar. One has straight-cut bangs and\nbraids. The other girl's hair is bound up with an orange cord.\nThe air gets even thinner.\nI feel as though hot blood is oozing down the back of my neck, but when I\nwipe it away with my hand, it's transparent sweat.\nTaki.\"\nI look up. Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai are standing there. They hand me a\nsingle book. Foil letters in a weighty font are stamped on its thick cover:\nItomori Comet Disaster List and Catalog of Victims\nI turn the pages. The victims' names and addresses are given by district. I\nrun my finger down them. I keep turning pages. Finally, my finger stops on\nnames I recognize.\nTeshigawara, Katsuhiko (17)\nNatori, Sayaka (17)\n\"Teshigawara and Saya...\"\nAs I murmur, I hear Tsukasa and Okudera-senpai suck in their breath.\nThen I find the names that prove it all.\nMiyamizu, Hitoha (82)\nMiyamizu, Mitsuha (17)\nMiyamizu, \\btsuha (9)\nThe other two peer over my shoulder at the list.\n\"That's her.? It has to be some kind of mistake! I mean, she's\u2014\"\nOkudera-senpai sounds as if she might burst into tears. \"She's been dead for\nthree years.\"",

I check to\nmake sure it didn't get wet, then turn it on. In the darkness, every single\nmovement sounds violently loud. With an electronic vvum that seems\ncompletely out of place here, the phone comes alive, and I use it as a flashlight.\nThis place is wholly devoid of color or warmth.\nThe tiny shrine the light reveals is completely gray. On a small stone altar,\ntwo four-inch urns sit side by side.\n\"It's the sake we carried up here.\"\nGently, I touch the surface. I don't know when it happened, but I'm not cold\nanymore.\n\"This is her little sister's...\"\nMy hand closes around the urn on the left, confirming its shape. When I pick\nit up, there's a slight resistance and a faint, dry tearing noise. The moss had put\ndown roots.\n\"And this is the one I brought.\"\nI sit down where I am, bring the urn close to my face, and shine the light on\nit. The porcelain was shiny before, but now it's thickly covered with moss. It\nmust have been a very long time. I put a thought that's been inside me all this\ntime into words.\n. .Then I was swapping with the Mitsuha from three years ago?\"\nI untie the braided cord sealing the lid. Underneath, there's a cork stopper.\n\"Were we three years out of sync? Did the swapping stop because she died\nthree years ago when the meteorite fell?\"\nI pull out the cork. The faint scent of alcohol rises. I pour the sake into the\nlid.\n\"Half of her...\"\nI bring the light closer to it. The sake is clear, with several tiny particles\nfloating in it. They reflect the light, glittering in the liquid.\n\" Musubi . Twisting and tangling, sometimes coming undone, then\nreuniting...\"\nI raise the lidful of sake to my lips.\n\"If time really can 'come undone,' then... Just one more time...\"\nTake me to her! I wish and down it in one gulp. When I swallow, the sound\nis so conspicuous it startles me. A lump of heat travels through my body. As it\nhits the bottom of my stomach, it bursts, scattering through me.\nBut nothing happens.\nFor a little while, I sit very still.\nI'm not used to alcohol, and I feel a little warm. My head feels slightly\nvague and dizzy... But that's all.\nIt's no good. It didn't work.\nI put one knee up, then stand. Abruptly, my feet tangle. My vision spins. I'm\nfalling , I think.\n...That's weird.\nI've fallen over backward, but no matter how much time passes, my back\ndoesn't hit the ground. My field of view rotates, slowly, up to the roof of the\ncave. My phone is still in my left hand. The light illuminates the ceiling.\n\"The comet...!\"\nInvoluntarily, I say it out loud.\nThere's a drawing of an enormous comet up there.\nIt's a very old picture, carved into the rock: a giant traveling star, trailing\nits long tail across the heavens. The red and blue pigments catch the light and\nshimmer. Gradually, the picture begins rising away from the ceiling of the\ncave.\nI stare.\nThe image, the illustrated comet, is falling toward me.\nSlowly, it bears down until it's nearly on top of me. It blazes with the heat\nof its friction against the atmosphere, and the lump of rock fuses into glass,\nshining like a jewel. Even those details are clear to me.\nI fall back, and my head hits the rock at the exact moment the comet strikes",

I remember!\"\nConfidence deepening, I open my eyes again. There's a white half-moon in\nthe distant horizon.\n\"Mitsuha, Mitsuha... Mitsuha, Misua, Misua. Your name is Misua!\"\nI'm yelling her name at the half-moon.\n\"Your name is...!\"\nAbruptly, the outline of the word I meant to utter blurs.\nI quickly snatch up the pen and write the first letter of her name on my\npalm... Or I try to.\n66\nAfter a single line, my hand stops. The tip of the pen starts to tremble. I\nwant to make it stop shaking and grip it tight. I try stabbing it in like a needle,\nto carve a name that won't disappear. The pen won't budge a traction of an\ninch. My lips move.\n\"...Who are you?\"\nThe pen falls from my hand.\nThey're vanishing. Your name. Your memories.\n\"Why did I come here?\"\nI want to tether them to me somehow, to scrape the fragments of memory\ntogether, so I say them aloud.\n\"Her... I came to see her! I came to save her! I wanted her to live!\"\nIt's disappearing. Something so precious to me is disappearing.\n\"Who are you? Who are you, who are you, who are you...?\"\nSlipping away.

I don't even know why I'm\ncrying now. My emotions are disintegrating, crumbling like a sand castle.\n\"Who are you, who are you, who...?\"\nAfter the sand has completely eroded, just one thing remains. I know it's\nloneliness. In that moment, I understand. From now on, this feeling will be all\nthat stays with me. I'll hold nothing but loneliness, a burden someone's forced\nme to take.\nFine, I think defiantly. Even if the world is cruel, even if all I have is\nloneliness, I'll still live with everything I've got. Even if this emotion is all I\nhave, I'll keep struggling. Even if we're separated, even if we never meet\nagain, I'll fight. As if I'd ever resign myself to this! The powerful, fleeting\nresolution feels as though I'm picking a fight with the gods. Very soon, I'll\nforget even the fact that I've forgotten something.\nAnd so, making that single emotion my foothold, I demand of the night sky\none last time:\n\"What's your name?\"\nThe cry becomes an echo, rebounding off the dark mountains.

Well, it's not going so great.\"\n\"Hmm...\" Okudera-senpai murmurs, bringing her face closer to mine. She\ninspects me from head to toe with a frown. Then, gravely, she asks, \"You don't\nthink it's because suits don't look good on you?\"\n\"I-is it really that bad?!\" Involuntarily, I look down at myself.\n\"Oh, come on, I'mjoking!\"\nOkudera-senpai beams, her expression changing easily.\n\"Let's walk a little,\" Okudera-senpai says, and I follow her. We set off,\ngoing against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut\nacross Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that\nthe trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass\nhave on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,\ntoo.\n\"What's going on today? Your text came out of the blue.\"\nFeeling as if I'm the only one who hasn't kept up with the season, I turn to\nOkudera-senpai beside me.\n\"What?\" Her glossy lips pout. \"I can't get in touch with you without a\nreason?\"\n\"No, no, no!\" I wave my hands hastily.\n\"You're happy to see me, aren't you? It's been a long time.\"\n\"Y-yes. I am.\"\nShe smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. \"I was in the area\nfor work and thought I'd like to see your face, Taki.\" She was hired by a major\nclothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. \"Life in the suburbs\nis fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind,\" she tells me, gazing at\nher surroundings like she's a little awestruck. \"Look,\" she says suddenly, and I\nraise my head.\nWe're crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we're eye level with the giant\noutdoor display screen above an electronics store. It's showing aerial footage\nof gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster\u2014Eight\nYears Later in big letters.\n\"We went to Itomori once, didn't we?\" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,\nas though she's searching distant memories. \"You were still in high school,\nTaki, so it must've been...\"\n\"Five years ago, maybe?\" I finish the sentence for her.\n\"That long...\" She exhales a little, as if surprised. \"I'm forgetting all sorts\nof things.\"\nShe's right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk\nup Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I\ntry remembering that day.\nIt was the summer of my second year in high school\u2014 No, it was just about\nthis time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short\ntrip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way\nto Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.\nRight, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the\nside of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur\nand grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a\nvague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed\na mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to\nTokyo by myself the next day.\nThat's right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that\ncomet.\nIn the sort of natural disaster that's happened only a few times in human\nhistory, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,\nalmost all the town's residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the\ncomet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and\nmost of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.\nIt was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all\nsorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical\nphenomenon and the townspeople's stupendous luck were enough to stir up the\nmedia's and public's imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around\nwildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet's visit\nwith Itomori's dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or\nquestioned the mayor of Itomori's use of plenary power in forcing an\nevacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been\nforetold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so\nisolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the\npower across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite\nstrike, spurred public speculation. Society's excitement lasted until the\nprograms to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as\nwith most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of\nItomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.\nStill... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I'd even drawn sketches of\nItomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had\nmaterialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had\nvisited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.\nWhat in the world had it been?\nWell, I guess it's not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink\ninto the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn't matter now. I\nwrite the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job\nnext year, not ancient history I don't really remember.\n\"The wind's come up,\" Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair\nrises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,\nreaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a\nmelancholy inside me.\n\"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough,\" Okudera-senpai\nsays when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.",
