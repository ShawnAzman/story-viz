First, she tried to look down and make out\nwhat she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she\nlooked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with\ncupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures\nhung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she\npassed; it was labelled \"ORANGE MARMALADE\", but to her great\ndisappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear\nof killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the\ncupboards as she fell past it.\n\"Well!\" thought Alice to herself, \"after such a fall as this, I shall\nthink nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me\nat home! Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the\ntop of the house!\" (Which was very likely true.)\nDown, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? \"I wonder how\nmany miles I've fallen by this time?\" she said aloud. \"I must be\ngetting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would\nbe four thousand miles down, I think\u2014\" (for, you see, Alice had learnt\nseveral things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and\nthough this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her\nknowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good\npractice to say it over) \"\u2014yes, that's about the right distance\u2014but\nthen I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I've got to?\" (Alice had no\nidea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice\ngrand words to say.)\nPresently she began again. \"I wonder if I shall fall right _through_\nthe earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk\nwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think\u2014\" (she was rather\nglad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all\nthe right word) \"\u2014but I shall have to ask them what the name of the\ncountry is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?\"\n(and she tried to curtsey as she spoke\u2014fancy _curtseying_ as you're\nfalling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) \"And what\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking! No, it'll never do\nto ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.\"\nDown, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began\ntalking again. \"Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!\"\n(Dinah was the cat.) \"I hope they'll remember her saucer of milk at\ntea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are\nno mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's\nvery like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?\" And here\nAlice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a\ndreamy sort of way, \"Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?\" and\nsometimes, \"Do bats eat cats?\" for, you see, as she couldn't answer\neither question, it didn't much matter which way she put it. She felt\nthat she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was\nwalking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly,\n\"Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?\" when suddenly,\nthump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and\nthe fall was over.",

I almost think I can remember feeling\na little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who\nin the world am I? Ah, _that's_ the great puzzle!\" And she began\nthinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as\nherself, to see if she could have been changed for any of them.\n\"I'm sure I'm not Ada,\" she said, \"for her hair goes in such long\nringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't\nbe Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she, oh! she knows such a\nvery little! Besides, _she's_ she, and _I'm_ I, and\u2014oh dear, how\npuzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.\nLet me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen,\nand four times seven is\u2014oh dear! I shall never get to twenty at that\nrate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try\nGeography.

No, I've\nmade up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be\nno use their putting their heads down and saying 'Come up again, dear!'\nI shall only look up and say 'Who am I then? Tell me that first, and\nthen, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not, I'll stay down\nhere till I'm somebody else'\u2014but, oh dear!\" cried Alice, with a sudden\nburst of tears, \"I do wish they _would_ put their heads down!

That _will_ be a queer thing, to be\nsure! However, everything is queer to-day.\"\nJust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way\noff, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought\nit must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small\nshe was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had\nslipped in like herself.\n\"Would it be of any use, now,\" thought Alice, \"to speak to this mouse?\nEverything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very\nlikely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.\" So she\nbegan: \"O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired\nof swimming about here, O Mouse!\" (Alice thought this must be the right\nway of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but\nshe remembered having seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, \"A mouse\u2014of\na mouse\u2014to a mouse\u2014a mouse\u2014O mouse!\") The Mouse looked at her rather\ninquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,\nbut it said nothing.\n\"Perhaps it doesn't understand English,\" thought Alice; \"I daresay it's\na French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.\" (For, with all\nher knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago\nanything had happened.) So she began again: \"O\u00f9 est ma chatte?\" which\nwas the first sentence in her French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a\nsudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with\nfright. \"Oh, I beg your pardon!\" cried Alice hastily, afraid that she\nhad hurt the poor animal's feelings. \"I quite forgot you didn't like\ncats.\"\n\"Not like cats!\" cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. \"Would\n_you_ like cats if you were me?\"\n\"Well, perhaps not,\" said Alice in a soothing tone: \"don't be angry\nabout it. And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah: I think you'd\ntake a fancy to cats if you could only see her. She is such a dear\nquiet thing,\" Alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about\nin the pool, \"and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her\npaws and washing her face\u2014and she is such a nice soft thing to\nnurse\u2014and she's such a capital one for catching mice\u2014oh, I beg your\npardon!\" cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all\nover, and she felt certain it must be really offended. \"We won't talk\nabout her any more if you'd rather not.\"\n\"We indeed!\" cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his\ntail. \"As if _I_ would talk on such a subject! Our family always\n_hated_ cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name\nagain!\"\n\"I won't indeed!\" said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of\nconversation. \"Are you\u2014are you fond\u2014of\u2014of dogs?\" The Mouse did not\nanswer, so Alice went on eagerly: \"There is such a nice little dog near\nour house I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you\nknow, with oh, such long curly brown hair! And it'll fetch things when\nyou throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts\nof things\u2014I can't remember half of them\u2014and it belongs to a farmer, you\nknow, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds! He says\nit kills all the rats and\u2014oh dear!\" cried Alice in a sorrowful tone,\n\"I'm afraid I've offended it again!\" For the Mouse was swimming away\nfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the\npool as it went.\nSo she called softly after it, \"Mouse dear! Do come back again, and we\nwon't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!\" When the\nMouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its face\nwas quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in a low\ntrembling voice, \"Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my\nhistory, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.\"\nIt was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the",

And she's such a capital one for catching mice you\ncan't think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!

It's high time you were all in\nbed!\" On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left\nalone.\n\"I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!\" she said to herself in a melancholy\ntone. \"Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm sure she's the best\ncat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shall ever see you\nany more!\" And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she felt very\nlonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again heard a\nlittle pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up\neagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was\ncoming back to finish his story.",

Alice knew it was\nthe Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shook the\nhouse, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as\nlarge as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.\nPresently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as\nthe door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it,\nthat attempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself \"Then I'll\ngo round and get in at the window.\"\n\"_That_ you won't!\" thought Alice, and, after waiting till she fancied\nshe heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly spread out her\nhand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold of anything,\nbut she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass,\nfrom which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a\ncucumber-frame, or something of the sort.",

I wouldn't be in\nBill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but\nI _think_ I can kick a little!\"\nShe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till\nshe heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what sort it was)\nscratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then,\nsaying to herself \"This is Bill,\" she gave one sharp kick, and waited\nto see what would happen next.\nThe first thing she heard was a general chorus of \"There goes Bill!\"\nthen the Rabbit's voice along\u2014\"Catch him, you by the hedge!\" then\nsilence, and then another confusion of voices\u2014\"Hold up his head\u2014Brandy\nnow\u2014Don't choke him\u2014How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell\nus all about it!\"\nLast came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (\"That's Bill,\" thought\nAlice,) \"Well, I hardly know\u2014No more, thank ye; I'm better now\u2014but I'm\na deal too flustered to tell you\u2014all I know is, something comes at me\nlike a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!\"\n\"So you did, old fellow!\" said the others.\n\"We must burn the house down!\" said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice\ncalled out as loud as she could, \"If you do, I'll set Dinah at you!\"\nThere was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, \"I\nwonder what they _will_ do next! If they had any sense, they'd take the\nroof off.\" After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and\nAlice heard the Rabbit say, \"A barrowful will do, to begin with.\"\n\"A barrowful of _what?_\" thought Alice; but she had not long to doubt,\nfor the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the\nwindow, and some of them hit her in the face. \"I'll put a stop to\nthis,\" she said to herself, and shouted out, \"You'd better not do that\nagain!\" which produced another dead silence.\nAlice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into\nlittle cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her\nhead. \"If I eat one of these cakes,\" she thought, \"it's sure to make\n_some_ change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it\nmust make me smaller, I suppose.\"\nSo she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she\nbegan shrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get\nthrough the door, she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of\nlittle animals and birds waiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill,\nwas in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it\nsomething out of a bottle. They all made a rush at Alice the moment she\nappeared; but she ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself\nsafe in a thick wood.",

Alice looked all round her at\nthe flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that\nlooked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.\nThere was a large mushroom growing near her, about the same height as\nherself; and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and\nbehind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what\nwas on the top of it.\nShe stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the\nmushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue\ncaterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly\nsmoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her or of",

            "text": "Advice from a Caterpillar\nThe Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in\nsilence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and\naddressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.\n\"Who are _you?_\" said the Caterpillar.\nThis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied,\nrather shyly, \"I\u2014I hardly know, sir, just at present\u2014at least I know\nwho I _was_ when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been\nchanged several times since then.\"\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said the Caterpillar sternly. \"Explain\nyourself!\"\n\"I can't explain _myself_, I'm afraid, sir,\" said Alice, \"because I'm\nnot myself, you see.\"\n\"I don't see,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,\" Alice replied very politely,\n\"for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many\ndifferent sizes in a day is very confusing.\"\n\"It isn't,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,\" said Alice; \"but when you\nhave to turn into a chrysalis\u2014you will some day, you know\u2014and then\nafter that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little\nqueer, won't you?\"\n\"Not a bit,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,\" said Alice; \"all I know\nis, it would feel very queer to _me_.\"\n\"You!\" said the Caterpillar contemptuously. \"Who are _you?_\"\nWhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.\nAlice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such _very_\nshort remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, \"I\nthink, you ought to tell me who _you_ are, first.\"\n\"Why?\" said the Caterpillar.\nHere was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any\ngood reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a _very_ unpleasant\nstate of mind, she turned away.\n\"Come back!\" the Caterpillar called after her. \"I've something\nimportant to say!\"\nThis sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.\n\"Keep your temper,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Is that all?\" said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as she\ncould.\n\"No,\" said the Caterpillar.\nAlice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do,\nand perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For\nsome minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded\nits arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, \"So you\nthink you're changed, do you?\"\n\"I'm afraid I am, sir,\" said Alice; \"I can't remember things as I\nused\u2014and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!\"\n\"Can't remember _what_ things?\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, I've tried to say \"How doth the little busy bee,\" but it all\ncame different!\" Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.\n\"Repeat, \"_You are old, Father William_,'\" said the Caterpillar.\nAlice folded her hands, and began:\u2014\n\"You are old, Father William,\" the young man said,\n\"And your hair has become very white;\nAnd yet you incessantly stand on your head\u2014\nDo you think, at your age, it is right?\"\n\"In my youth,\" Father William replied to his son,\n\"I feared it might injure the brain;\nBut, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,\nWhy, I do it again and again.\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"as I mentioned before,\nAnd have grown most uncommonly fat;\nYet you turned a back-somersault in at the door\u2014\nPray, what is the reason of that?\"\n\"In my youth,\" said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,\n\"I kept all my limbs very supple\nBy the use of this ointment\u2014one shilling the box\u2014\nAllow me to sell you a couple?\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"and your jaws are too weak\nFor anything tougher than suet;\nYet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak\u2014\nPray, how did you manage to do it?\"\n\"In my youth,\" said his father, \"I took to the law,\nAnd argued each case with my wife;\nAnd the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,\nHas lasted the rest of my life.\"\n\"You are old,\" said the youth, \"one would hardly suppose\nThat your eye was as steady as ever;\nYet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose\u2014\nWhat made you so awfully clever?\"\n\"I have answered three questions, and that is enough,\"\nSaid his father; \"don't give yourself airs!\nDo you think I can listen all day to such stuff?\nBe off, or I'll kick you down stairs!\"\n\"That is not said right,\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Not _quite_ right, I'm afraid,\" said Alice, timidly; \"some of the\nwords have got altered.\"\n\"It is wrong from beginning to end,\" said the Caterpillar decidedly,\nand there was silence for some minutes.\nThe Caterpillar was the first to speak.\n\"What size do you want to be?\" it asked.\n\"Oh, I'm not particular as to size,\" Alice hastily replied; \"only one\ndoesn't like changing so often, you know.\"\n\"I _don't_ know,\" said the Caterpillar.\nAlice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life\nbefore, and she felt that she was losing her temper.\n\"Are you content now?\" said the Caterpillar.\n\"Well, I should like to be a _little_ larger, sir, if you wouldn't\nmind,\" said Alice: \"three inches is such a wretched height to be.\"\n\"It is a very good height indeed!\" said the Caterpillar angrily,\nrearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).\n\"But I'm not used to it!\" pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she\nthought of herself, \"I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily\noffended!\"\n\"You'll get used to it in time,\" said the Caterpillar; and it put the\nhookah into its mouth and began smoking again.\nThis time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a\nminute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and\nyawned once or twice, and shook itself. Then it got down off the\nmushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went,\n\"One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you\ngrow shorter.\"\n\"One side of _what?_ The other side of _what?_\" thought Alice to\nherself.\n\"Of the mushroom,\" said the Caterpillar, just as if she had asked it\naloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.",

            "text": "Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute,\ntrying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was\nperfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at\nlast she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke\noff a bit of the edge with each hand.\n\"And now which is which?\" she said to herself, and nibbled a little of\nthe right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a\nviolent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!\nShe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt\nthat there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she\nset to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed\nso closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her\nmouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the\nlefthand bit.\n* * * * * * *\n* * * * * *\n* * * * * * *\n\"Come, my head's free at last!\" said Alice in a tone of delight, which\nchanged into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders\nwere nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was\nan immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a\nsea of green leaves that lay far below her.\n\"What _can_ all that green stuff be?\" said Alice. \"And where _have_ my\nshoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?\"\nShe was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow,\nexcept a little shaking among the distant green leaves.\nAs there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head,\nshe tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that\nher neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She\nhad just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was\ngoing to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but\nthe tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp\nhiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her\nface, and was beating her violently with its wings.\n\"Serpent!\" screamed the Pigeon.\n\"I'm _not_ a serpent!\" said Alice indignantly. \"Let me alone!\"\n\"Serpent, I say again!\" repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued\ntone, and added with a kind of sob, \"I've tried every way, and nothing\nseems to suit them!\"\n\"I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,\" said Alice.\n\"I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried\nhedges,\" the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; \"but those\nserpents! There's no pleasing them!\"\nAlice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in\nsaying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.\n\"As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,\" said the Pigeon;\n\"but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, I\nhaven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!\"\n\"I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,\" said Alice, who was beginning to\nsee its meaning.\n\"And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,\" continued the\nPigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, \"and just as I was thinking I\nshould be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down\nfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!\"\n\"But I'm _not_ a serpent, I tell you!\" said Alice. \"I'm a\u2014I'm a\u2014\"\n\"Well! _What_ are you?\" said the Pigeon. \"I can see you're trying to\ninvent something!\"\n\"I\u2014I'm a little girl,\" said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she remembered\nthe number of changes she had gone through that day.\n\"A likely story indeed!\" said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest\ncontempt. \"I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never\n_one_ with such a neck as that! No, no! You're a serpent; and there's\nno use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never\ntasted an egg!\"\n\"I _have_ tasted eggs, certainly,\" said Alice, who was a very truthful\nchild; \"but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you\nknow.\"\n\"I don't believe it,\" said the Pigeon; \"but if they do, why then\nthey're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.\"\nThis was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a\nminute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, \"You're\nlooking for eggs, I know _that_ well enough; and what does it matter to\nme whether you're a little girl or a serpent?\"\n\"It matters a good deal to _me_,\" said Alice hastily; \"but I'm not\nlooking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want\n_yours_: I don't like them raw.\"\n\"Well, be off, then!\" said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled\ndown again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as well\nas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches,\nand every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while\nshe remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands,\nand she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at\nthe other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until\nshe had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.\nIt was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it\nfelt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes,\nand began talking to herself, as usual. \"Come, there's half my plan\ndone now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm\ngoing to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my\nright size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden\u2014how\n_is_ that to be done, I wonder?\" As she said this, she came suddenly\nupon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.\n\"Whoever lives there,\" thought Alice, \"it'll never do to come upon them\n_this_ size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!\" So she\nbegan nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go\nnear the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.",

It was opened by\nanother footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a\nfrog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled\nall over their heads. She felt very curious to know what it was all\nabout, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.\nThe Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter,\nnearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to the other,\nsaying, in a solemn tone, \"For the Duchess. An invitation from the\nQueen to play croquet.\" The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn\ntone, only changing the order of the words a little, \"From the Queen.\nAn invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.\"\nThen they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.\nAlice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood\nfor fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the\nFish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the\ndoor, staring stupidly up into the sky.\nAlice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.\n\"There's no sort of use in knocking,\" said the Footman, \"and that for\ntwo reasons. First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you\nare; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could\npossibly hear you.\" And certainly there _was_ a most extraordinary\nnoise going on within\u2014a constant howling and sneezing, and every now\nand then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to\npieces.\n\"Please, then,\" said Alice, \"how am I to get in?\"\n\"There might be some sense in your knocking,\" the Footman went on\nwithout attending to her, \"if we had the door between us. For instance,\nif you were _inside_, you might knock, and I could let you out, you\nknow.\" He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, and\nthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. \"But perhaps he can't help it,\"\nshe said to herself; \"his eyes are so _very_ nearly at the top of his\nhead. But at any rate he might answer questions.\u2014How am I to get in?\"\nshe repeated, aloud.\n\"I shall sit here,\" the Footman remarked, \"till tomorrow\u2014\"\nAt this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came\nskimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his nose,\nand broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him.\n\"\u2014or next day, maybe,\" the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly\nas if nothing had happened.\n\"How am I to get in?\" asked Alice again, in a louder tone.\n\"_Are_ you to get in at all?\" said the Footman. \"That's the first\nquestion, you know.\"\nIt was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. \"It's really\ndreadful,\" she muttered to herself, \"the way all the creatures argue.\nIt's enough to drive one crazy!\"\nThe Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his\nremark, with variations. \"I shall sit here,\" he said, \"on and off, for\ndays and days.\"\n\"But what am _I_ to do?\" said Alice.\n\"Anything you like,\" said the Footman, and began whistling.\n\"Oh, there's no use in talking to him,\" said Alice desperately: \"he's\nperfectly idiotic!\" And she opened the door and went in.",

Even the Duchess sneezed\noccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling\nalternately without a moment's pause. The only things in the kitchen\nthat did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting\non the hearth and grinning from ear to ear.\n\"Please would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, for she was\nnot quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first, \"why\nyour cat grins like that?\"\n\"It's a Cheshire cat,\" said the Duchess, \"and that's why. Pig!\"\nShe said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite\njumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the\nbaby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on again:\u2014\n\"I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't\nknow that cats _could_ grin.\"\n\"They all can,\" said the Duchess; \"and most of 'em do.\"\n\"I don't know of any that do,\" Alice said very politely, feeling quite\npleased to have got into a conversation.\n\"You don't know much,\" said the Duchess; \"and that's a fact.\"\nAlice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would\nbe as well to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she\nwas trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the\nfire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at\nthe Duchess and the baby\u2014the fire-irons came first; then followed a\nshower of saucepans, plates, and dishes. The Duchess took no notice of\nthem even when they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already,\nthat it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.\n\"Oh, _please_ mind what you're doing!\" cried Alice, jumping up and down\nin an agony of terror. \"Oh, there goes his _precious_ nose!\" as an\nunusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it\noff.\n\"If everybody minded their own business,\" the Duchess said in a hoarse\ngrowl, \"the world would go round a deal faster than it does.\"\n\"Which would _not_ be an advantage,\" said Alice, who felt very glad to\nget an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge. \"Just\nthink of what work it would make with the day and night! You see the\nearth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis\u2014\"\n\"Talking of axes,\" said the Duchess, \"chop off her head!\"\nAlice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take\nthe hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to\nbe listening, so she went on again: \"Twenty-four hours, I _think_; or\nis it twelve? I\u2014\"\n\"Oh, don't bother _me_,\" said the Duchess; \"I never could abide\nfigures!\" And with that she began nursing her child again, singing a\nsort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violent shake at\nthe end of every line:\n\"Speak roughly to your little boy,\nAnd beat him when he sneezes:\nHe only does it to annoy,\nBecause he knows it teases.\"\nCHORUS.\n(In which the cook and the baby joined):\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\nWhile the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing\nthe baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so,\nthat Alice could hardly hear the words:\u2014\n\"I speak severely to my boy,\nI beat him when he sneezes;\nFor he can thoroughly enjoy\nThe pepper when he pleases!\"\nCHORUS.\n\"Wow! wow! wow!\"\n\"Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!\" the Duchess said to Alice,\nflinging the baby at her as she spoke. \"I must go and get ready to play\ncroquet with the Queen,\" and she hurried out of the room.

Mind\nnow!\" The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, it was impossible\nto say which), and they went on for some while in silence.\nAlice was just beginning to think to herself, \"Now, what am I to do\nwith this creature when I get it home?\" when it grunted again, so\nviolently, that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time\nthere could be _no_ mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than\na pig, and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it\nfurther.\nSo she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it\ntrot away quietly into the wood. \"If it had grown up,\" she said to\nherself, \"it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes\nrather a handsome pig, I think.\" And she began thinking over other\nchildren she knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying",

He had been looking at\nAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first\nspeech.\n\"You should learn not to make personal remarks,\" Alice said with some\nseverity; \"it's very rude.\"\nThe Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he _said_\nwas, \"Why is a raven like a writing-desk?\"\n\"Come, we shall have some fun now!\" thought Alice. \"I'm glad they've\nbegun asking riddles.\u2014I believe I can guess that,\" she added aloud.\n\"Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?\" said\nthe March Hare.\n\"Exactly so,\" said Alice.\n\"Then you should say what you mean,\" the March Hare went on.\n\"I do,\" Alice hastily replied; \"at least\u2014at least I mean what I\nsay\u2014that's the same thing, you know.\"\n\"Not the same thing a bit!\" said the Hatter. \"You might just as well\nsay that 'I see what I eat' is the same thing as 'I eat what I see'!\"\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the March Hare, \"that 'I like what\nI get' is the same thing as 'I get what I like'!\"\n\"You might just as well say,\" added the Dormouse, who seemed to be\ntalking in his sleep, \"that 'I breathe when I sleep' is the same thing\nas 'I sleep when I breathe'!\"\n\"It _is_ the same thing with you,\" said the Hatter, and here the\nconversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while\nAlice thought over all she could remember about ravens and\nwriting-desks, which wasn't much.\nThe Hatter was the first to break the silence. \"What day of the month\nis it?\" he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his\npocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,\nand holding it to his ear.\nAlice considered a little, and then said \"The fourth.\"\n\"Two days wrong!\" sighed the Hatter. \"I told you butter wouldn't suit\nthe works!\" he added looking angrily at the March Hare.\n\"It was the _best_ butter,\" the March Hare meekly replied.\n\"Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,\" the Hatter grumbled:\n\"you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.\"\nThe March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped\nit into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of\nnothing better to say than his first remark, \"It was the _best_ butter,\nyou know.\"\nAlice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. \"What a\nfunny watch!\" she remarked. \"It tells the day of the month, and doesn't\ntell what o'clock it is!\"\n\"Why should it?\" muttered the Hatter. \"Does _your_ watch tell you what\nyear it is?\"\n\"Of course not,\" Alice replied very readily: \"but that's because it\nstays the same year for such a long time together.\"\n\"Which is just the case with _mine_,\" said the Hatter.\nAlice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no\nsort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. \"I don't quite\nunderstand you,\" she said, as politely as she could.\n\"The Dormouse is asleep again,\" said the Hatter, and he poured a little\nhot tea upon its nose.\nThe Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its\neyes, \"Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.\"\n\"Have you guessed the riddle yet?\" the Hatter said, turning to Alice\nagain.\n\"No, I give it up,\" Alice replied: \"what's the answer?\"\n\"I haven't the slightest idea,\" said the Hatter.\n\"Nor I,\" said the March Hare.\nAlice sighed wearily. \"I think you might do something better with the\ntime,\" she said, \"than waste it in asking riddles that have no\nanswers.\"\n\"If you knew Time as well as I do,\" said the Hatter, \"you wouldn't talk\nabout wasting _it_. It's _him_.\"\n\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Alice.\n\"Of course you don't!\" the Hatter said, tossing his head\ncontemptuously. \"I dare say you never even spoke to Time!\"\n\"Perhaps not,\" Alice cautiously replied: \"but I know I have to beat\ntime when I learn music.\"\n\"Ah! that accounts for it,\" said the Hatter. \"He won't stand beating.\nNow, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do almost anything\nyou liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in\nthe morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a\nhint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-past one,\ntime for dinner!\"\n(\"I only wish it was,\" the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)\n\"That would be grand, certainly,\" said Alice thoughtfully: \"but then\u2014I\nshouldn't be hungry for it, you know.\"\n\"Not at first, perhaps,\" said the Hatter: \"but you could keep it to\nhalf-past one as long as you liked.\"\n\"Is that the way _you_ manage?\" Alice asked.\nThe Hatter shook his head mournfully. \"Not I!\" he replied. \"We\nquarrelled last March\u2014just before _he_ went mad, you know\u2014\" (pointing\nwith his tea spoon at the March Hare,) \"\u2014it was at the great concert\ngiven by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing\n'Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!\nHow I wonder what you're at!'\nYou know the song, perhaps?\"\n\"I've heard something like it,\" said Alice.\n\"It goes on, you know,\" the Hatter continued, \"in this way:\u2014\n'Up above the world you fly,\nLike a tea-tray in the sky.\nTwinkle, twinkle\u2014'\"\nHere the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep\n\"_Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle_\u2014\" and went on so long that they\nhad to pinch it to make it stop.\n\"Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,\" said the Hatter, \"when the\nQueen jumped up and bawled out, 'He's murdering the time! Off with his\nhead!'\"\n\"How dreadfully savage!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\"And ever since that,\" the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, \"he won't\ndo a thing I ask! It's always six o'clock now.\"\nA bright idea came into Alice's head. \"Is that the reason so many\ntea-things are put out here?\" she asked.\n\"Yes, that's it,\" said the Hatter with a sigh: \"it's always tea-time,\nand we've no time to wash the things between whiles.\"\n\"Then you keep moving round, I suppose?\" said Alice.\n\"Exactly so,\" said the Hatter: \"as the things get used up.\"\n\"But what happens when you come to the beginning again?\" Alice ventured\nto ask.\n\"Suppose we change the subject,\" the March Hare interrupted, yawning.\n\"I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.\"\n\"I'm afraid I don't know one,\" said Alice, rather alarmed at the\nproposal.\n\"Then the Dormouse shall!\" they both cried. \"Wake up, Dormouse!\" And\nthey pinched it on both sides at once.\nThe Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. \"I wasn't asleep,\" he said in a\nhoarse, feeble voice: \"I heard every word you fellows were saying.\"\n\"Tell us a story!\" said the March Hare.\n\"Yes, please do!\" pleaded Alice.\n\"And be quick about it,\" added the Hatter, \"or you'll be asleep again\nbefore it's done.\"\n\"Once upon a time there were three little sisters,\" the Dormouse began\nin a great hurry; \"and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and\nthey lived at the bottom of a well\u2014\"\n\"What did they live on?\" said Alice, who always took a great interest\nin questions of eating and drinking.\n\"They lived on treacle,\" said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or\ntwo.\n\"They couldn't have done that, you know,\" Alice gently remarked;\n\"they'd have been ill.\"\n\"So they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"_very_ ill.\"\nAlice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of\nliving would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: \"But\nwhy did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\n\"Take some more tea,\" the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.\n\"I've had nothing yet,\" Alice replied in an offended tone, \"so I can't\ntake more.\"\n\"You mean you can't take _less_,\" said the Hatter: \"it's very easy to\ntake _more_ than nothing.\"\n\"Nobody asked _your_ opinion,\" said Alice.\n\"Who's making personal remarks now?\" the Hatter asked triumphantly.\nAlice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to\nsome tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and\nrepeated her question. \"Why did they live at the bottom of a well?\"\nThe Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then\nsaid, \"It was a treacle-well.\"\n\"There's no such thing!\" Alice was beginning very angrily, but the\nHatter and the March Hare went \"Sh! sh!\" and the Dormouse sulkily\nremarked, \"If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for\nyourself.\"\n\"No, please go on!\" Alice said very humbly; \"I won't interrupt again. I\ndare say there may be _one_.\"\n\"One, indeed!\" said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consented to\ngo on. \"And so these three little sisters\u2014they were learning to draw,\nyou know\u2014\"\n\"What did they draw?\" said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.\n\"Treacle,\" said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.\n\"I want a clean cup,\" interrupted the Hatter: \"let's all move one place\non.\"\nHe moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare\nmoved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the\nplace of the March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any\nadvantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than\nbefore, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.\nAlice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very\ncautiously: \"But I don't understand. Where did they draw the treacle\nfrom?\"\n\"You can draw water out of a water-well,\" said the Hatter; \"so I should\nthink you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well\u2014eh, stupid?\"\n\"But they were _in_ the well,\" Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing\nto notice this last remark.\n\"Of course they were,\" said the Dormouse; \"\u2014well in.\"\nThis answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for\nsome time without interrupting it.\n\"They were learning to draw,\" the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing\nits eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; \"and they drew all manner of\nthings\u2014everything that begins with an M\u2014\"\n\"Why with an M?\" said Alice.\n\"Why not?\" said the March Hare.\nAlice was silent.\nThe Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a\ndoze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a\nlittle shriek, and went on: \"\u2014that begins with an M, such as\nmouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness\u2014you know you say\nthings are \"much of a muchness\"\u2014did you ever see such a thing as a\ndrawing of a muchness?\"\n\"Really, now you ask me,\" said Alice, very much confused, \"I don't\nthink\u2014\"\n\"Then you shouldn't talk,\" said the Hatter.\nThis piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in\ngreat disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and\nneither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she\nlooked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:\nthe last time she saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into\nthe teapot.",

            "text": "The Queen's Croquet-Ground\nA large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses\ngrowing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily\npainting them red. Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she\nwent nearer to watch them, and just as she came up to them she heard\none of them say, \"Look out now, Five! Don't go splashing paint over me\nlike that!\"\n\"I couldn't help it,\" said Five, in a sulky tone; \"Seven jogged my\nelbow.\"\nOn which Seven looked up and said, \"That's right, Five! Always lay the\nblame on others!\"\n\"_You'd_ better not talk!\" said Five. \"I heard the Queen say only\nyesterday you deserved to be beheaded!\"\n\"What for?\" said the one who had spoken first.\n\"That's none of _your_ business, Two!\" said Seven.\n\"Yes, it _is_ his business!\" said Five, \"and I'll tell him\u2014it was for\nbringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.\"\nSeven flung down his brush, and had just begun \"Well, of all the unjust\nthings\u2014\" when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stood watching\nthem, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,\nand all of them bowed low.\n\"Would you tell me,\" said Alice, a little timidly, \"why you are\npainting those roses?\"\nFive and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low\nvoice, \"Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a\n_red_ rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen\nwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So\nyou see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she comes, to\u2014\" At this\nmoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called\nout \"The Queen! The Queen!\" and the three gardeners instantly threw\nthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps,\nand Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.\nFirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the\nthree gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the\ncorners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with\ndiamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. After these came\nthe royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came\njumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all\nornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens,\nand among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a\nhurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went\nby without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying\nthe King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this\ngrand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.\nAlice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face\nlike the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard\nof such a rule at processions; \"and besides, what would be the use of a\nprocession,\" thought she, \"if people had all to lie down upon their\nfaces, so that they couldn't see it?\" So she stood still where she was,\nand waited.\nWhen the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked\nat her, and the Queen said severely \"Who is this?\" She said it to the\nKnave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.\n\"Idiot!\" said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turning to\nAlice, she went on, \"What's your name, child?\"\n\"My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,\" said Alice very politely;\nbut she added, to herself, \"Why, they're only a pack of cards, after\nall. I needn't be afraid of them!\"\n\"And who are _these?_\" said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners\nwho were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lying on\ntheir faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of\nthe pack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers,\nor courtiers, or three of her own children.\n\"How should _I_ know?\" said Alice, surprised at her own courage. \"It's\nno business of _mine_.\"\nThe Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a\nmoment like a wild beast, screamed \"Off with her head! Off\u2014\"\n\"Nonsense!\" said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was\nsilent.\nThe King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said \"Consider, my\ndear: she is only a child!\"\nThe Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave \"Turn\nthem over!\"\nThe Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.\n\"Get up!\" said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three\ngardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen,\nthe royal children, and everybody else.\n\"Leave off that!\" screamed the Queen. \"You make me giddy.\" And then,\nturning to the rose-tree, she went on, \"What _have_ you been doing\nhere?\"\n\"May it please your Majesty,\" said Two, in a very humble tone, going\ndown on one knee as he spoke, \"we were trying\u2014\"\n\"_I_ see!\" said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses.\n\"Off with their heads!\" and the procession moved on, three of the\nsoldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran\nto Alice for protection.",

They're dreadfully\nfond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any\none left alive!\"\nShe was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she\ncould get away without being seen, when she noticed a curious\nappearance in the air: it puzzled her very much at first, but, after\nwatching it a minute or two, she made it out to be a grin, and she said\nto herself \"It's the Cheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk\nto.\"\n\"How are you getting on?\" said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth\nenough for it to speak with.\nAlice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. \"It's no use\nspeaking to it,\" she thought, \"till its ears have come, or at least one\nof them.\" In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put\ndown her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad\nshe had someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there\nwas enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared.\n\"I don't think they play at all fairly,\" Alice began, in rather a\ncomplaining tone, \"and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear\noneself speak\u2014and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at\nleast, if there are, nobody attends to them\u2014and you've no idea how\nconfusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the\narch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the\nground\u2014and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only\nit ran away when it saw mine coming!\"\n\"How do you like the Queen?\" said the Cat in a low voice.\n\"Not at all,\" said Alice: \"she's so extremely\u2014\" Just then she noticed\nthat the Queen was close behind her, listening: so she went on,\n\"\u2014likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.\"\nThe Queen smiled and passed on.\n\"Who _are_ you talking to?\" said the King, going up to Alice, and\nlooking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.\n\"It's a friend of mine\u2014a Cheshire Cat,\" said Alice: \"allow me to\nintroduce it.\"\n\"I don't like the look of it at all,\" said the King: \"however, it may\nkiss my hand if it likes.\"\n\"I'd rather not,\" the Cat remarked.\n\"Don't be impertinent,\" said the King, \"and don't look at me like\nthat!\" He got behind Alice as he spoke.\n\"A cat may look at a king,\" said Alice. \"I've read that in some book,\nbut I don't remember where.\"\n\"Well, it must be removed,\" said the King very decidedly, and he called\nthe Queen, who was passing at the moment, \"My dear! I wish you would\nhave this cat removed!\"\nThe Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or\nsmall. \"Off with his head!\" she said, without even looking round.\n\"I'll fetch the executioner myself,\" said the King eagerly, and he\nhurried off.\nAlice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going\non, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with\npassion. She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be\nexecuted for having missed their turns, and she did not like the look\nof things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she never knew\nwhether it was her turn or not. So she went in search of her hedgehog.\nThe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed\nto Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the\nother: the only difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to\nthe other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a\nhelpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.\nBy the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight\nwas over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: \"but it doesn't\nmatter much,\" thought Alice, \"as all the arches are gone from this side\nof the ground.\" So she tucked it away under her arm, that it might not\nescape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her\nfriend.\nWhen she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite\na large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between\nthe executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once,\nwhile all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.\nThe moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle\nthe question, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they\nall spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly\nwhat they said.\nThe executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless\nthere was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such a\nthing before, and he wasn't going to begin at _his_ time of life.\nThe King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be\nbeheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.\nThe Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in\nless than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.

He was an old crab, _he_ was.\"\n\"I never went to him,\" the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: \"he taught\nLaughing and Grief, they used to say.\"\n\"So he did, so he did,\" said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both\ncreatures hid their faces in their paws.\n\"And how many hours a day did you do lessons?\" said Alice, in a hurry\nto change the subject.\n\"Ten hours the first day,\" said the Mock Turtle: \"nine the next, and so\non.\"\n\"What a curious plan!\" exclaimed Alice.\n\"That's the reason they're called lessons,\" the Gryphon remarked:\n\"because they lessen from day to day.\"\nThis was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little",

Tell her to\nbegin.\" He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of\nauthority over Alice.\n\"Stand up and repeat ''_Tis the voice of the sluggard_,'\" said the\nGryphon.\n\"How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!\"\nthought Alice; \"I might as well be at school at once.\" However, she got\nup, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the Lobster\nQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came\nvery queer indeed:\u2014\n\"'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,\n\"You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.\"\nAs a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose\nTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.\"\n[later editions continued as follows\nWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,\nAnd will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,\nBut, when the tide rises and sharks are around,\nHis voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]\n\"That's different from what _I_ used to say when I was a child,\" said\nthe Gryphon.\n\"Well, I never heard it before,\" said the Mock Turtle; \"but it sounds\nuncommon nonsense.\"\nAlice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,\nwondering if anything would _ever_ happen in a natural way again.\n\"I should like to have it explained,\" said the Mock Turtle.\n\"She can't explain it,\" said the Gryphon hastily. \"Go on with the next\nverse.\"\n\"But about his toes?\" the Mock Turtle persisted. \"How _could_ he turn\nthem out with his nose, you know?\"\n\"It's the first position in dancing.\" Alice said; but was dreadfully\npuzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.\n\"Go on with the next verse,\" the Gryphon repeated impatiently: \"it\nbegins '_I passed by his garden_.'\"\nAlice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come\nwrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:\u2014\n\"I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,\nHow the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie\u2014\"\n[later editions continued as follows\nThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,\nWhile the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.\nWhen the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,\nWas kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:\nWhile the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,\nAnd concluded the banquet\u2014]\n\"What _is_ the use of repeating all that stuff,\" the Mock Turtle\ninterrupted, \"if you don't explain it as you go on? It's by far the\nmost confusing thing _I_ ever heard!\"\n\"Yes, I think you'd better leave off,\" said the Gryphon: and Alice was\nonly too glad to do so.",

In the very middle of the\ncourt was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so\ngood, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them\u2014\"I wish they'd\nget the trial done,\" she thought, \"and hand round the refreshments!\"\nBut there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at\neverything about her, to pass away the time.\nAlice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read\nabout them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew\nthe name of nearly everything there. \"That's the judge,\" she said to\nherself, \"because of his great wig.\"\nThe judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the\nwig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he\ndid not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.\n\"And that's the jury-box,\" thought Alice, \"and those twelve creatures,\"\n(she was obliged to say \"creatures,\" you see, because some of them were\nanimals, and some were birds,) \"I suppose they are the jurors.\" She\nsaid this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather\nproud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little\ngirls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However, \"jury-men\"\nwould have done just as well.\nThe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. \"What are\nthey doing?\" Alice whispered to the Gryphon. \"They can't have anything\nto put down yet, before the trial's begun.\"\n\"They're putting down their names,\" the Gryphon whispered in reply,\n\"for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.\"\n\"Stupid things!\" Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she\nstopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, \"Silence in the\ncourt!\" and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round,\nto make out who was talking.\nAlice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,\nthat all the jurors were writing down \"stupid things!\" on their slates,\nand she could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell\n\"stupid,\" and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. \"A nice\nmuddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!\" thought Alice.\nOne of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice\ncould _not_ stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and\nvery soon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly\nthat the poor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out\nat all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he\nwas obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this\nwas of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.\n\"Herald, read the accusation!\" said the King.\nOn this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then",

She soon\ngot it out again, and put it right; \"not that it signifies much,\" she\nsaid to herself; \"I should think it would be _quite_ as much use in the\ntrial one way up as the other.\"\nAs soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being\nupset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to\nthem, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the\naccident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do\nanything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the\ncourt.\n\"What do you know about this business?\" the King said to Alice.\n\"Nothing,\" said Alice.\n\"Nothing _whatever?_\" persisted the King.\n\"Nothing whatever,\" said Alice.\n\"That's very important,\" the King said, turning to the jury. They were\njust beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White\nRabbit interrupted: \"_Un_important, your Majesty means, of course,\" he\nsaid in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as\nhe spoke.\n\"_Un_important, of course, I meant,\" the King hastily said, and went on\nto himself in an undertone,\n\"important\u2014unimportant\u2014unimportant\u2014important\u2014\" as if he were trying\nwhich word sounded best.\nSome of the jury wrote it down \"important,\" and some \"unimportant.\"\nAlice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slates;\n\"but it doesn't matter a bit,\" she thought to herself.\nAt this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in\nhis note-book, cackled out \"Silence!\" and read out from his book, \"Rule\nForty-two. _All persons more than a mile high to leave the court_.\"\nEverybody looked at Alice.\n\"_I'm_ not a mile high,\" said Alice.\n\"You are,\" said the King.\n\"Nearly two miles high,\" added the Queen.\n\"Well, I shan't go, at any rate,\" said Alice: \"besides, that's not a\nregular rule: you invented it just now.\"\n\"It's the oldest rule in the book,\" said the King.\n\"Then it ought to be Number One,\" said Alice.\nThe King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. \"Consider your\nverdict,\" he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.\n\"There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,\" said the\nWhite Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; \"this paper has just been\npicked up.\"\n\"What's in it?\" said the Queen.\n\"I haven't opened it yet,\" said the White Rabbit, \"but it seems to be a\nletter, written by the prisoner to\u2014to somebody.\"\n\"It must have been that,\" said the King, \"unless it was written to\nnobody, which isn't usual, you know.\"\n\"Who is it directed to?\" said one of the jurymen.\n\"It isn't directed at all,\" said the White Rabbit; \"in fact, there's\nnothing written on the _outside_.\" He unfolded the paper as he spoke,\nand added \"It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.\"\n\"Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?\" asked another of the jurymen.\n\"No, they're not,\" said the White Rabbit, \"and that's the queerest\nthing about it.\" (The jury all looked puzzled.)\n\"He must have imitated somebody else's hand,\" said the King. (The jury\nall brightened up again.)\n\"Please your Majesty,\" said the Knave, \"I didn't write it, and they\ncan't prove I did: there's no name signed at the end.\"\n\"If you didn't sign it,\" said the King, \"that only makes the matter\nworse. You _must_ have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed\nyour name like an honest man.\"\nThere was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really\nclever thing the King had said that day.\n\"That _proves_ his guilt,\" said the Queen.\n\"It proves nothing of the sort!\" said Alice. \"Why, you don't even know\nwhat they're about!\"\n\"Read them,\" said the King.\nThe White Rabbit put on his spectacles. \"Where shall I begin, please\nyour Majesty?\" he asked.\n\"Begin at the beginning,\" the King said gravely, \"and go on till you\ncome to the end: then stop.\"\nThese were the verses the White Rabbit read:\u2014\n\"They told me you had been to her,\nAnd mentioned me to him:\nShe gave me a good character,\nBut said I could not swim.\nHe sent them word I had not gone\n(We know it to be true):\nIf she should push the matter on,\nWhat would become of you?\nI gave her one, they gave him two,\nYou gave us three or more;\nThey all returned from him to you,\nThough they were mine before.\nIf I or she should chance to be\nInvolved in this affair,\nHe trusts to you to set them free,\nExactly as we were.\nMy notion was that you had been\n(Before she had this fit)\nAn obstacle that came between\nHim, and ourselves, and it.\nDon't let him know she liked them best,\nFor this must ever be\nA secret, kept from all the rest,\nBetween yourself and me.\"\n\"That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,\" said the\nKing, rubbing his hands; \"so now let the jury\u2014\"\n\"If any one of them can explain it,\" said Alice, (she had grown so\nlarge in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit afraid of\ninterrupting him,) \"I'll give him sixpence. _I_ don't believe there's\nan atom of meaning in it.\"\nThe jury all wrote down on their slates, \"_She_ doesn't believe there's\nan atom of meaning in it,\" but none of them attempted to explain the\npaper.\n\"If there's no meaning in it,\" said the King, \"that saves a world of\ntrouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any. And yet I don't\nknow,\" he went on, spreading out the verses on his knee, and looking at\nthem with one eye; \"I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.\n\"\u2014_said I could not swim_\u2014\" you can't swim, can you?\" he added, turning\nto the Knave.\nThe Knave shook his head sadly. \"Do I look like it?\" he said. (Which he\ncertainly did _not_, being made entirely of cardboard.)\n\"All right, so far,\" said the King, and he went on muttering over the\nverses to himself: \"'_We know it to be true_\u2014' that's the jury, of\ncourse\u2014'_I gave her one, they gave him two_\u2014' why, that must be what he\ndid with the tarts, you know\u2014\"\n\"But, it goes on '_they all returned from him to you_,'\" said Alice.\n\"Why, there they are!\" said the King triumphantly, pointing to the\ntarts on the table. \"Nothing can be clearer than _that_. Then\nagain\u2014'_before she had this fit_\u2014' you never had fits, my dear, I\nthink?\" he said to the Queen.\n\"Never!\" said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard\nas she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his\nslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily\nbegan again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long\nas it lasted.)\n\"Then the words don't _fit_ you,\" said the King, looking round the\ncourt with a smile. There was a dead silence.\n\"It's a pun!\" the King added in an offended tone, and everybody\nlaughed, \"Let the jury consider their verdict,\" the King said, for\nabout the twentieth time that day.\n\"No, no!\" said the Queen. \"Sentence first\u2014verdict afterwards.\"\n\"Stuff and nonsense!\" said Alice loudly. \"The idea of having the\nsentence first!\"\n\"Hold your tongue!\" said the Queen, turning purple.\n\"I won't!\" said Alice.\n\"Off with her head!\" the Queen shouted at the top of her voice. Nobody\nmoved.\n\"Who cares for you?\" said Alice, (she had grown to her full size by\nthis time.) \"You're nothing but a pack of cards!\"\nAt this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon\nher: she gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and\ntried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her\nhead in the lap of her sister, who was gently brushing away some dead\nleaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face.\n\"Wake up, Alice dear!\" said her sister; \"Why, what a long sleep you've\nhad!\"\n\"Oh, I've had such a curious dream!\" said Alice, and she told her\nsister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange\nAdventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she\nhad finished, her sister kissed her, and said, \"It _was_ a curious\ndream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.\"\nSo Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might,\nwhat a wonderful dream it had been.\nBut her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her\nhand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all",
