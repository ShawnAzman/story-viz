       "'LINE 1: In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\\nLINE 2: that I\\'ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\\nLINE 3: \"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\" he told me, \"just\\nLINE 4: remember that all the people in this world haven\\'t had the advantages\\nLINE 5: that you\\'ve had.\"\\nLINE 6: He didn\\'t say any more, but we\\'ve always been unusually communicative\\nLINE 7: in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\\nLINE 8: than that. In consequence, I\\'m inclined to reserve all judgements, a\\nLINE 9: habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\\nLINE 10: the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\\nLINE 11: detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\\nLINE 12: person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\\nLINE 13: being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\\nLINE 14: unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\\nLINE 15: feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\\nLINE 16: some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\\nLINE 17: the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\\nLINE 18: the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\\nLINE 19: marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\\nLINE 20: infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\\nLINE 21: forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\\nLINE 22: repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\\nLINE 23: unequally at birth.\\nLINE 24: And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\\nLINE 25: that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the\\nLINE 26: wet marshes, but after a certain point I don\\'t care what it\\'s founded\\nLINE 27: on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\\nLINE 28: the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\\nLINE 29: wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\\nLINE 30: human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\\nLINE 31: exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\\nLINE 32: have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\\nLINE 33: successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\\nLINE 34: heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\\nLINE 35: to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\\nLINE 36: thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\\nLINE 37: flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\\nLINE 38: \"creative temperament\"—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\\nLINE 39: romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\\nLINE 40: which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out\\nLINE 41: all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\\nLINE 42: floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\\nLINE 43: interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\\nLINE 44: ------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLINE 45: My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle\\nLINE 46: Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a\\nLINE 47: clan, and we have a tradition that we\\'re descended from the Dukes of\\nLINE 48: Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather\\'s\\nLINE 49: brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil\\nLINE 50: War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father\\nLINE 51: carries on today.\\nLINE 52: I never saw this great-uncle, but I\\'m supposed to look like him—with\\nLINE 53: special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\\nLINE 54: father\\'s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of\\nLINE 55: a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that\\nLINE 56: delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\\nLINE 57: counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\\nLINE 58: the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the\\nLINE 59: ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond\\nLINE 60: business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it\\nLINE 61: could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\\nLINE 62: over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,\\nLINE 63: \"Why—ye-es,\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\\nLINE 64: me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I\\nLINE 65: thought, in the spring of twenty-two.\\nLINE 66: The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm\\nLINE 67: season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly\\nLINE 68: trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a\\nLINE 69: house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He\\nLINE 70: found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a\\nLINE 71: month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and\\nLINE 72: I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a\\nLINE 73: few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who\\nLINE 74: made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to\\nLINE 75: herself over the electric stove.\\nLINE 76: It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more\\nLINE 77: recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.\\nLINE 78: \"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\\nLINE 79: I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,\\nLINE 80: a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\\nLINE 81: freedom of the neighbourhood.\\nLINE 82: And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\\nLINE 83: trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar\\nLINE 84: conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\\nLINE 85: There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to\\nLINE 86: be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\\nLINE 87: volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they\\nLINE 88: stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,\\nLINE 89: promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and\\nLINE 90: Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other\\nLINE 91: books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a\\nLINE 92: series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now\\nLINE 93: I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become\\nLINE 94: again that most limited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\"\\nLINE 95: This isn\\'t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at\\nLINE 96: from a single window, after all.\\nLINE 97: It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\\nLINE 98: the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\\nLINE 99: riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where\\nLINE 100: there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\\nLINE 101: land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\\nLINE 102: contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\\nLINE 103: domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great\\nLINE 104: wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the\\nLINE 105: egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact\\nLINE 106: end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\\nLINE 107: wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\\nLINE 108: interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular\\nLINE 109: except shape and size.\\nLINE 110: I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though\\nLINE 111: this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\\nLINE 112: sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\\nLINE 113: egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\\nLINE 114: places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\\nLINE 115: my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual\\nLINE 116: imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one\\nLINE 117: side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble\\nLINE 118: swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was\\nLINE 119: Gatsby\\'s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn\\'t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a\\nLINE 120: mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an\\nLINE 121: eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I\\nLINE 122: had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour\\'s lawn, and\\nLINE 123: the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a\\nLINE 124: month.\\nLINE 125: Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\\nLINE 126: glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\\nLINE 127: on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\\nLINE 128: Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I\\'d known Tom\\nLINE 129: in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\\nLINE 130: Chicago.\\nLINE 131: Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\\nLINE 132: the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a\\nLINE 133: national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\\nLINE 134: limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of\\nLINE 135: anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his\\nLINE 136: freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he\\'d left Chicago\\nLINE 137: and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\\nLINE 138: instance, he\\'d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\\nLINE 139: Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was\\nLINE 140: wealthy enough to do that.\\nLINE 141: Why they came East I don\\'t know. They had spent a year in France for\\nLINE 142: no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully\\nLINE 143: wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a\\nLINE 144: permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn\\'t believe\\nLINE 145: it—I had no sight into Daisy\\'s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift\\nLINE 146: on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of\\nLINE 147: some irrecoverable football game.\\nLINE 148: And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\\nLINE 149: Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house\\nLINE 150: was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white\\nLINE 151: Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at\\nLINE 152: the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,\\nLINE 153: jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when\\nLINE 154: it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though\\nLINE 155: from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French\\nLINE 156: windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm\\nLINE 157: windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with\\nLINE 158: his legs apart on the front porch.\\nLINE 159: He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy\\nLINE 160: straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\\nLINE 161: supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\\nLINE 162: dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\\nLINE 163: aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\\nLINE 164: clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill\\nLINE 165: those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\\nLINE 166: see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\\nLINE 167: thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\\nLINE 168: His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\\nLINE 169: fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\\nLINE 170: it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who\\nLINE 171: had hated his guts.\\nLINE 172: \"Now, don\\'t think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\\nLINE 173: say, \"just because I\\'m stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\\nLINE 174: were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I\\nLINE 175: always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\\nLINE 176: him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\\nLINE 177: We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\\nLINE 178: \"I\\'ve got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\\nLINE 179: restlessly.\\nLINE 180: Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the\\nLINE 181: front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\\nLINE 182: acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped\\nLINE 183: the tide offshore.\\nLINE 184: \"It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\\nLINE 185: politely and abruptly. \"We\\'ll go inside.\"\\nLINE 186: We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,\\nLINE 187: fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The\\nLINE 188: windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\\nLINE 189: that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\\nLINE 190: the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\\nLINE 191: flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\\nLINE 192: ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\\nLINE 193: on it as wind does on the sea.\\nLINE 194: The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\\nLINE 195: couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\\nLINE 196: anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\\nLINE 197: rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\\nLINE 198: short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\\nLINE 199: listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\\nLINE 200: picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\\nLINE 201: rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\\nLINE 202: curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\\nLINE 203: floor.\\nLINE 204: The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\\nLINE 205: length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\\nLINE 206: chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\\nLINE 207: was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\\nLINE 208: she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\\nLINE 209: an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\\nLINE 210: The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly\\nLINE 211: forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,\\nLINE 212: charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\\nLINE 213: room.\\nLINE 214: \"I\\'m p-paralysed with happiness.\"\\nLINE 215: She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\\nLINE 216: hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\\nLINE 217: no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\\nLINE 218: had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\\nLINE 219: Baker. (I\\'ve heard it said that Daisy\\'s murmur was only to make people\\nLINE 220: lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\\nLINE 221: charming.)\\nLINE 222: At any rate, Miss Baker\\'s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\\nLINE 223: imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object\\nLINE 224: she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\\nLINE 225: something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.\\nLINE 226: Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned\\nLINE 227: tribute from me.\\nLINE 228: I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,\\nLINE 229: thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\\nLINE 230: down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\\nLINE 231: played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\\nLINE 232: bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\\nLINE 233: in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\\nLINE 234: a singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had\\nLINE 235: done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\\nLINE 236: exciting things hovering in the next hour.\\nLINE 237: I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,\\nLINE 238: and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\\nLINE 239: \"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\\nLINE 240: \"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\\nLINE 241: painted black as a mourning wreath, and there\\'s a persistent wail all\\nLINE 242: night along the north shore.\"\\nLINE 243: \"How gorgeous! Let\\'s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\\nLINE 244: irrelevantly: \"You ought to see the baby.\"\\nLINE 245: \"I\\'d like to.\"\\nLINE 246: \"She\\'s asleep. She\\'s three years old. Haven\\'t you ever seen her?\"\\nLINE 247: \"Never.\"\\nLINE 248: \"Well, you ought to see her. She\\'s—\"\\nLINE 249: Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped\\nLINE 250: and rested his hand on my shoulder.\\nLINE 251: \"What you doing, Nick?\"\\nLINE 252: \"I\\'m a bond man.\"\\nLINE 253: \"Who with?\"\\nLINE 254: I told him.\\nLINE 255: \"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\\nLINE 256: This annoyed me.\\nLINE 257: \"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\\nLINE 258: \"Oh, I\\'ll stay in the East, don\\'t you worry,\" he said, glancing at\\nLINE 259: Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something\\nLINE 260: more. \"I\\'d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\\nLINE 261: At this point Miss Baker said: \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that\\nLINE 262: I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the\\nLINE 263: room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned\\nLINE 264: and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\\nLINE 265: \"I\\'m stiff,\" she complained, \"I\\'ve been lying on that sofa for as long\\nLINE 266: as I can remember.\"\\nLINE 267: \"Don\\'t look at me,\" Daisy retorted, \"I\\'ve been trying to get you to\\nLINE 268: New York all afternoon.\"\\nLINE 269: \"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\\nLINE 270: pantry. \"I\\'m absolutely in training.\"\\nLINE 271: Her host looked at her incredulously.\\nLINE 272: \"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom\\nLINE 273: of a glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\\nLINE 274: I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I\\nLINE 275: enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\\nLINE 276: an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\\nLINE 277: at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\\nLINE 278: back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\\nLINE 279: discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\\nLINE 280: picture of her, somewhere before.\\nLINE 281: \"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\\nLINE 282: there.\"\\nLINE 283: \"I don\\'t know a single—\"\\nLINE 284: \"You must know Gatsby.\"\\nLINE 285: \"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\\nLINE 286: Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\\nLINE 287: wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\\nLINE 288: me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\\nLINE 289: Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\\nLINE 290: young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\\nLINE 291: the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\\nLINE 292: diminished wind.\\nLINE 293: \"Why candles?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\\nLINE 294: fingers. \"In two weeks it\\'ll be the longest day in the year.\" She\\nLINE 295: looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\\nLINE 296: of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\\nLINE 297: the year and then miss it.\"\\nLINE 298: \"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\\nLINE 299: table as if she were getting into bed.\\nLINE 300: \"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What\\'ll we plan?\" She turned to me\\nLINE 301: helplessly: \"What do people plan?\"\\nLINE 302: Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\\nLINE 303: little finger.\\nLINE 304: \"Look!\" she complained; \"I hurt it.\"\\nLINE 305: We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\\nLINE 306: \"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn\\'t mean to,\\nLINE 307: but you did do it. That\\'s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a\\nLINE 308: great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—\"\\nLINE 309: \"I hate that word \\'hulking,\\'\\u200a\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in\\nLINE 310: kidding.\"\\nLINE 311: \"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\\nLINE 312: Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\\nLINE 313: bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\\nLINE 314: as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\\nLINE 315: desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\\nLINE 316: polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\\nLINE 317: that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\\nLINE 318: would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\\nLINE 319: West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its\\nLINE 320: close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\\nLINE 321: nervous dread of the moment itself.\\nLINE 322: \"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\\nLINE 323: of corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can\\'t you talk about crops or\\nLINE 324: something?\"\\nLINE 325: I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in\\nLINE 326: an unexpected way.\\nLINE 327: \"Civilization\\'s going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently. \"I\\'ve\\nLINE 328: gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise\\nLINE 329: of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?\"\\nLINE 330: \"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\\nLINE 331: \"Well, it\\'s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is\\nLINE 332: if we don\\'t look out the white race will be—will be utterly\\nLINE 333: submerged. It\\'s all scientific stuff; it\\'s been proved.\"\\nLINE 334: \"Tom\\'s getting very profound,\" said Daisy, with an expression of\\nLINE 335: unthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in\\nLINE 336: them. What was that word we—\"\\nLINE 337: \"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\\nLINE 338: impatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It\\'s up to\\nLINE 339: us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will\\nLINE 340: have control of things.\"\\nLINE 341: \"We\\'ve got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\\nLINE 342: toward the fervent sun.\\nLINE 343: \"You ought to live in California—\" began Miss Baker, but Tom\\nLINE 344: interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\\nLINE 345: \"This idea is that we\\'re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,\\nLINE 346: and—\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\\nLINE 347: slight nod, and she winked at me again. \"—And we\\'ve produced all the\\nLINE 348: things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all\\nLINE 349: that. Do you see?\"\\nLINE 350: There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his\\nLINE 351: complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.\\nLINE 352: When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler\\nLINE 353: left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned\\nLINE 354: towards me.\\nLINE 355: \"I\\'ll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically.\\nLINE 356: \"It\\'s about the butler\\'s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler\\'s\\nLINE 357: nose?\"\\nLINE 358: \"That\\'s why I came over tonight.\"\\nLINE 359: \"Well, he wasn\\'t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher\\nLINE 360: for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred\\nLINE 361: people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it\\nLINE 362: began to affect his nose—\"\\nLINE 363: \"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\\nLINE 364: \"Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up\\nLINE 365: his position.\"\\nLINE 366: For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her\\nLINE 367: glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I\\nLINE 368: listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering\\nLINE 369: regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\\nLINE 370: The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom\\'s ear,\\nLINE 371: whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went\\nLINE 372: inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned\\nLINE 373: forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\\nLINE 374: \"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an\\nLINE 375: absolute rose. Doesn\\'t he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:\\nLINE 376: \"An absolute rose?\"\\nLINE 377: This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\\nLINE 378: extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart\\nLINE 379: was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,\\nLINE 380: thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and\\nLINE 381: excused herself and went into the house.\\nLINE 382: Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\\nLINE 383: meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\"\\nLINE 384: in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the\\nLINE 385: room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to\\nLINE 386: hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,\\nLINE 387: mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\\nLINE 388: \"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—\" I began.\\nLINE 389: \"Don\\'t talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\\nLINE 390: \"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\\nLINE 391: \"You mean to say you don\\'t know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\\nLINE 392: \"I thought everybody knew.\"\\nLINE 393: \"I don\\'t.\"\\nLINE 394: \"Why—\" she said hesitantly. \"Tom\\'s got some woman in New York.\"\\nLINE 395: \"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\\nLINE 396: Miss Baker nodded.\\nLINE 397: \"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.\\nLINE 398: Don\\'t you think?\"\\nLINE 399: Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a\\nLINE 400: dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at\\nLINE 401: the table.\\nLINE 402: \"It couldn\\'t be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\\nLINE 403: She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and\\nLINE 404: continued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute, and it\\'s very romantic\\nLINE 405: outdoors. There\\'s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a\\nLINE 406: nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He\\'s singing\\nLINE 407: away—\" Her voice sang: \"It\\'s romantic, isn\\'t it, Tom?\"\\nLINE 408: \"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it\\'s light\\nLINE 409: enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.\"\\nLINE 410: The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head\\nLINE 411: decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,\\nLINE 412: vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes\\nLINE 413: at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I\\nLINE 414: was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to\\nLINE 415: avoid all eyes. I couldn\\'t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but\\nLINE 416: I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain\\nLINE 417: hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest\\'s shrill\\nLINE 418: metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation\\nLINE 419: might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone\\nLINE 420: immediately for the police.\\nLINE 421: The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\\nLINE 422: Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into\\nLINE 423: the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\\nLINE 424: trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed\\nLINE 425: Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\\nLINE 426: its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\\nLINE 427: Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and\\nLINE 428: her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that\\nLINE 429: turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\\nLINE 430: some sedative questions about her little girl.\\nLINE 431: \"We don\\'t know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly. \"Even\\nLINE 432: if we are cousins. You didn\\'t come to my wedding.\"\\nLINE 433: \"I wasn\\'t back from the war.\"\\nLINE 434: \"That\\'s true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I\\'ve had a very bad time, Nick,\\nLINE 435: and I\\'m pretty cynical about everything.\"\\nLINE 436: Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn\\'t say any more,\\nLINE 437: and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\\nLINE 438: daughter.\\nLINE 439: \"I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.\"\\nLINE 440: \"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you\\nLINE 441: what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\\nLINE 442: \"Very much.\"\\nLINE 443: \"It\\'ll show you how I\\'ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was\\nLINE 444: less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of\\nLINE 445: the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right\\nLINE 446: away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I\\nLINE 447: turned my head away and wept. \\'All right,\\' I said, \\'I\\'m glad it\\'s a\\nLINE 448: girl. And I hope she\\'ll be a fool—that\\'s the best thing a girl can be\\nLINE 449: in this world, a beautiful little fool.\\'\\nLINE 450: \"You see I think everything\\'s terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\\nLINE 451: convinced way. \"Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I\\nLINE 452: know. I\\'ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\\nLINE 453: Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom\\'s, and\\nLINE 454: she laughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated—God, I\\'m\\nLINE 455: sophisticated!\"\\nLINE 456: The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my\\nLINE 457: belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me\\nLINE 458: uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to\\nLINE 459: exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a\\nLINE 460: moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as\\nLINE 461: if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret\\nLINE 462: society to which she and Tom belonged.\\nLINE 463: ------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLINE 464: Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at\\nLINE 465: either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the\\nLINE 466: Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running\\nLINE 467: together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and\\nLINE 468: dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as\\nLINE 469: she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\\nLINE 470: When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\\nLINE 471: \"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in\\nLINE 472: our very next issue.\"\\nLINE 473: Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\\nLINE 474: stood up.\\nLINE 475: \"Ten o\\'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\\nLINE 476: ceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\\nLINE 477: \"Jordan\\'s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\\nLINE 478: \"over at Westchester.\"\\nLINE 479: \"Oh—you\\'re Jordan Baker.\"\\nLINE 480: I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous\\nLINE 481: expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the\\nLINE 482: sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard\\nLINE 483: some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I\\nLINE 484: had forgotten long ago.\\nLINE 485: \"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won\\'t you.\"\\nLINE 486: \"If you\\'ll get up.\"\\nLINE 487: \"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\\nLINE 488: \"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I\\'ll arrange a\\nLINE 489: marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I\\'ll sort of—oh—fling you\\nLINE 490: together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\\nLINE 491: you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—\"\\nLINE 492: \"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven\\'t heard a\\nLINE 493: word.\"\\nLINE 494: \"She\\'s a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn\\'t to let\\nLINE 495: her run around the country this way.\"\\nLINE 496: \"Who oughtn\\'t to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\\nLINE 497: \"Her family.\"\\nLINE 498: \"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick\\'s\\nLINE 499: going to look after her, aren\\'t you, Nick? She\\'s going to spend lots\\nLINE 500: of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be\\nLINE 501: very good for her.\"\\nLINE 502: Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\\nLINE 503: \"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\\nLINE 504: \"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\\nLINE 505: beautiful white—\"\\nLINE 506: \"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\\nLINE 507: demanded Tom suddenly.\\nLINE 508: \"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can\\'t seem to remember, but I think we\\nLINE 509: talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I\\'m sure we did. It sort of crept\\nLINE 510: up on us and first thing you know—\"\\nLINE 511: \"Don\\'t believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\\nLINE 512: I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes\\nLINE 513: later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood\\nLINE 514: side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor\\nLINE 515: Daisy peremptorily called: \"Wait!\\nLINE 516: \"I forgot to ask you something, and it\\'s important. We heard you were\\nLINE 517: engaged to a girl out West.\"\\nLINE 518: \"That\\'s right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\\nLINE 519: engaged.\"\\nLINE 520: \"It\\'s a libel. I\\'m too poor.\"\\nLINE 521: \"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again\\nLINE 522: in a flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people, so it must be\\nLINE 523: true.\"\\nLINE 524: Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn\\'t even\\nLINE 525: vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one\\nLINE 526: of the reasons I had come East. You can\\'t stop going with an old\\nLINE 527: friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention\\nLINE 528: of being rumoured into marriage.\\nLINE 529: Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\\nLINE 530: rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\\nLINE 531: away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out\\nLINE 532: of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such\\nLINE 533: intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman\\nLINE 534: in New York\" was really less surprising than that he had been\\nLINE 535: depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of\\nLINE 536: stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his\\nLINE 537: peremptory heart.\\nLINE 538: Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\\nLINE 539: garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and\\nLINE 540: when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and\\nLINE 541: sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had\\nLINE 542: blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the\\nLINE 543: trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth\\nLINE 544: blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered\\nLINE 545: across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I\\nLINE 546: was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of\\nLINE 547: my neighbour\\'s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\\nLINE 548: regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\\nLINE 549: movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\\nLINE 550: that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\\nLINE 551: his of our local heavens.\\nLINE 552: I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\\nLINE 553: that would do for an introduction. But I didn\\'t call to him, for he\\nLINE 554: gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched\\nLINE 555: out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was\\nLINE 556: from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced\\nLINE 557: seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute\\nLINE 558: and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked\\nLINE 559: once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the\\nLINE 560: unquiet darkness.'"

In consequence, I\\'m inclined to reserve all judgements, a\\nhabit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\\nthe victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\\ndetect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\\nperson, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\\nbeing a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\\nunknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\\nfeigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\\nsome unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\\nthe horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\\nthe terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\\nmarred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\\ninfinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\\nforget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\\nrepeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\\nunequally at birth.',\n",

His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his\\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he'd left Chicago\\nand come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\\ninstance, he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\\nForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was\\nwealthy enough to do that.\\nWhy they came East I don't know. They had spent a year in France for\\nno particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully\\nwherever people played polo and were rich together.

The lawn started at\\nthe beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,\\njumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when\\nit reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though\\nfrom the momentum of its run.

Now he was a sturdy\\nstraw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\\nsupercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\\ndominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\\naggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\\nclothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill\\nthose glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\\nsee a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\\nthin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\\nfractiousness he conveyed.

The\\nwindows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\\nthat seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\\nthe room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\\nflags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\\nceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\\non it as wind does on the sea.\\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\\ncouch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\\nanchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\\nrippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\\nshort flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\\nlistening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\\npicture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\\nrear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\\ncurtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\\nfloor.\\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\\nlength at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\\nchin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\\nwas quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\\nshe gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\\nan apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly\\nforward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,\\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\\nroom.\\n\"I\\'m p-paralysed with happiness.\"\\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\\nhand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\\nno one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\\nhad. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\\nBaker. (I\\'ve heard it said that Daisy\\'s murmur was only to make people\\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\\ncharming.)\\nAt any rate, Miss Baker\\'s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\\nimperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object',\n",

Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\\nbright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\\nin her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\\na singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had\\ndone gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\\nexciting things hovering in the next hour.\\nI told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,\\nand how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\\n\"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\\n\"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\\npainted black as a mourning wreath, and there\\'s a persistent wail all\\nnight along the north shore.\"\\n\"How gorgeous! Let\\'s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\\nirrelevantly: \"You ought to see the baby.\"\\n\"I\\'d like to.\"\\n\"She\\'s asleep. She\\'s three years old. Haven\\'t you ever seen her?\"\\n\"Never.\"\\n\"Well, you ought to see her.

Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned\\nand with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\\n\"I\\'m stiff,\" she complained, \"I\\'ve been lying on that sofa for as long\\nas I can remember.\"\\n\"Don\\'t look at me,\" Daisy retorted, \"I\\'ve been trying to get you to\\nNew York all afternoon.\"\\n\"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\\npantry. \"I\\'m absolutely in training.\"\\nHer host looked at her incredulously.\\n\"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom\\nof a glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\\nI looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I\\nenjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\\nan erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\\nat the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\\nback at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\\ndiscontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\\npicture of her, somewhere before.\\n\"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\\nthere.\"\\n\"I don\\'t know a single—\"\\n\"You must know Gatsby.\"\\n\"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\\nBefore I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\\nwedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\\nme from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\\nSlenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\\nyoung women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\\nthe sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\\ndiminished wind.\\n\"Why candles?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\\nfingers. \"In two weeks it\\'ll be the longest day in the year.\" She\\nlooked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\\nof the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\\nthe year and then miss it.\"\\n\"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\\ntable as if she were getting into bed.\\n\"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What\\'ll we plan?\" She turned to me\\nhelplessly: \"What do people plan?\"',\n",

Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\\nrakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\\nhaste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I\\nwondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed\\nimmoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a\\ngirl friend at a hotel.\\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just\\nshaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he\\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game,\" and I gathered later\\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of\\nMrs. Wilson\\'s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His\\nwife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with\\npride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven\\ntimes since they had been married.\\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now\\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,\\nwhich gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With\\nthe influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she\\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.',\n",

At high tide in the\\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or\\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats\\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\\nfoam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\\nto and from the city between nine in the morning and long past\\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra\\ngardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a\\nfruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left\\nhis back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in\\nthe kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in\\nhalf an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a\\nbutler's thumb.\\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\\nhundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas\\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark\\ngold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and\\nstocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that\\nmost of his female guests were too young to know one from another.\\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,\\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\\ncornets and piccolos, and low and high drums.

By midnight the hilarity had increased.

In the ditch beside the road, right side\\nup, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had\\nleft Gatsby\\'s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall\\naccounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting\\nconsiderable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,\\nas they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din\\nfrom those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to\\nthe already violent confusion of the scene.\\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the\\ntyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the\\nunusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of\\nGatsby\\'s library.\\n\"How\\'d it happen?\"\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\\n\"Don\\'t ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole\\nmatter. \"I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It\\nhappened, and that\\'s all I know.\"\\n\"Well, if you\\'re a poor driver you oughtn\\'t to try driving at night.\"\\n\"But I wasn\\'t even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn\\'t even\\ntrying.\"\\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\\n\"You\\'re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn\\'t driving.\\nThere\\'s another man in the car.\"\\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was\\nnow a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened\\nwide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a\\npale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively\\nat the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\\ngroaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment\\nbefore he perceived the man in the duster.\\n\"Wha\\'s matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\\n\"Look!\"\\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it\\nfor a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it\\nhad dropped from the sky.\\n\"It came off,\" someone explained.\\nHe nodded.\\n\"At first I din\\' notice we\\'d stopped.\"\\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,\\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\\n\"Wonder\\'ff tell me where there\\'s a gas\\'line station?\"\\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,\\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any\\nphysical bond.\\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\\n\"But the wheel\\'s off!\"\\nHe hesitated.\\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a\\nmoon was shining over Gatsby\\'s house, making the night fine as before,\\nand surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.\\nA sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who\\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the\\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were\\nall that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events\\nin a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me\\ninfinitely less than my personal affairs.\\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my\\nshadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York\\nto the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen\\nby their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded\\nrestaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I\\neven had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and\\nworked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing\\nmean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I\\nlet it blow quietly away.\\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the\\ngloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and\\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There\\nwere generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the\\nlibrary, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\\nmellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,\\nand over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,\\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue\\nand pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and\\nsmiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm\\ndarkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting\\nloneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who\\nloitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary\\nrestaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant\\nmoments of night and life.\\nAgain at eight o\\'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined\\nfive deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I\\nfelt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they\\nwaited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,\\nand lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining\\nthat I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate\\nexcitement, I wished them well.\\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I\\nfound her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,\\nbecause she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it\\nwas something more. I wasn\\'t actually in love, but I felt a sort of\\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world\\nconcealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,\\neven though they don\\'t in the beginning—and one day I found what it\\nwas. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\\nborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about\\nit—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me\\nthat night at Daisy\\'s. At her first big golf tournament there was a\\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved\\nher ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached\\nthe proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his\\nstatement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\\nShe wasn\\'t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this\\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to\\nthe world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you\\nnever blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on\\nthat same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving\\na car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\\nfender flicked a button on one man\\'s coat.\\n\"You\\'re a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\\ncareful, or you oughtn\\'t to drive at all.\"\\n\"I am careful.\"\\n\"No, you\\'re not.\"\\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\\n\"What\\'s that got to do with it?\"\\n\"They\\'ll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\\naccident.\"\\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That\\'s\\nwhy I like you.\"\\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as\\nbrakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself\\ndefinitely out of that tangle back home. I\\'d been writing letters once\\na week and signing them: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was\\nhow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of\\nperspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague\\nunderstanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever',\n",

Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there\\ncrystal glass.\"\\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of\\nthose who came to Gatsby\\'s house that summer. It is an old timetable\\nnow, disintegrating at its folds, and headed \"This schedule in effect\\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names, and they will\\ngive you a better impression than my generalities of those who\\naccepted Gatsby\\'s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of\\nknowing nothing whatever about him.\\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a\\nman named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who\\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\\nVoltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a\\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came\\nnear. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and\\nMr. Chrystie\\'s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned\\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,\\nin white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the\\ngarden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.\\nR. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the\\nFishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he\\nwent to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that\\nMrs. Ulysses Swett\\'s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies\\ncame, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice\\nA. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and\\nBeluga\\'s girls.\\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who\\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\\nS. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his\\nwife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to\\ngamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\\nnext day.\\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as\\n\"the boarder\"—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people\\nthere were Gus Waize and Horace O\\'Donavan and Lester Myer and George\\nDuckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the\\nBackhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and\\nthe Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the\\nSmirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who\\nkilled himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\\nthe same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with\\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\\nforgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria\\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves\\nto be.\\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O\\'Brien came\\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had\\nhis nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,\\nhis fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of\\nthe American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be\\nher chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and\\nwhose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\\nAll these people came to Gatsby\\'s house in the summer.',\n",

You\\'re having lunch with me today and I\\nthought we\\'d ride up together.\"\\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,\\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,\\nwith the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality\\nwas continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape\\nof restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping\\nfoot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\\n\"It\\'s pretty, isn\\'t it, old sport?\" He jumped off to give me a better\\nview. \"Haven\\'t you ever seen it before?\"\\nI\\'d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright\\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with\\na labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down\\nbehind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,\\nwe started to town.\\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an\\nelaborate roadhouse next door.\\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn\\'t reached West Egg\\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured\\nsuit.',\n",

I was brought up in America but educated at\\nOxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many\\nyears. It is a family tradition.\"\\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he\\nwas lying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed\\nit, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with\\nthis doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if\\nthere wasn\\'t something a little sinister about him, after all.\\n\"What part of the Middle West?\" I inquired casually.\\n\"San Francisco.\"\\n\"I see.\"\\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a\\nclan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling\\nmy leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\\nEurope—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that\\nof a turbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued\\na tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very\\nhard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\\ntook the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there\\nwas a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn\\'t\\nadvance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty\\nmen with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last\\nthey found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of\\ndead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave\\nme a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the\\nAdriatic Sea!\"\\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his\\nsmile. The smile comprehended Montenegro\\'s troubled history and\\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro\\'s warm little heart. My\\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,\\nfell into my palm.\\n\"That\\'s the one from Montenegro.\"\\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. \"Orderi di\\nDanilo,\" ran the circular legend, \"Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.\"\\n\"Turn it.\"\\n\"Major Jay Gatsby,\" I read, \"For Valour Extraordinary.\"\\n\"Here\\'s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It\\nwas taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of\\nDoncaster.\"\\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\\nlooking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.\\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\\n\"I\\'m going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\\nabout me. I didn\\'t want you to think I was just some nobody. You see,\\nI usually find myself among strangers because I drift here and there\\ntrying to forget the sad things that happened to me.\" He hesitated.\\n\"You\\'ll hear about it this afternoon.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes\\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\\n\"Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.\"\\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a\\nmoment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\\n\"—So I took one look at him,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand\\nearnestly, \"and what do you think I did?\"\\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and\\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: \\'All right, Katspaugh,\\ndon\\'t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.\\' He shut it then and\\nthere.\"\\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\\nrestaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was\\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the\\npresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street\\nbetter!\"\\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: \"It\\'s too\\nhot over there.\"\\n\"Hot and small—yes,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, \"but full of memories.\"\\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\\n\"The old Metropole.\"\\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. \"Filled with\\nfaces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can\\'t\\nforget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It\\nwas six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all\\nevening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a\\nfunny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. \\'All\\nright,\\' says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his\\nchair.\\n\"\\u200a\\'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don\\'t\\nyou, so help me, move outside this room.\\'\\n\"It was four o\\'clock in the morning then, and if we\\'d of raised the\\nblinds we\\'d of seen daylight.\"\\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\\n\"Sure he went.\" Mr. Wolfshiem\\'s nose flashed at me indignantly. \"He\\nturned around in the door and says: \\'Don\\'t let that waiter take away\\nmy coffee!\\' Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three\\ntimes in his full belly and drove away.\"\\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\\n\"Five, with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\\n\"I understand you\\'re looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\\nfor me:\\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn\\'t the man.\"\\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we\\'d talk about that some other\\ntime.\"\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, \"I had a wrong man.\"\\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more\\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around\\nthe room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people\\ndirectly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have\\ntaken one short glance beneath our own table.\\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I\\'m afraid I\\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\\n\"I don\\'t like mysteries,\" I answered, \"and I don\\'t understand why you\\nwon\\'t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got\\nto come through Miss Baker?\"\\n\"Oh, it\\'s nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker\\'s a great\\nsportswoman, you know, and she\\'d never do anything that wasn\\'t all\\nright.\"\\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,\\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his\\neyes. \"Fine fellow, isn\\'t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect\\ngentleman.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"He\\'s an Oggsford man.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\\n\"I\\'ve heard of it.\"\\n\"It\\'s one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure\\nof his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a\\nman of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to\\nmyself: \\'There\\'s the kind of man you\\'d like to take home and introduce\\nto your mother and sister.\\'\\u200a\" He paused. \"I see you\\'re looking at my\\ncuff buttons.\"\\nI hadn\\'t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of\\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That\\'s a very interesting idea.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby\\'s very\\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend\\'s\\nwife.\"\\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and\\nsat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his\\nfeet.\\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I\\'m going to run off from you\\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\\n\"Don\\'t hurry Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem\\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\\n\"You\\'re very polite, but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies\\nand your—\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\\nhand. \"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won\\'t impose myself on\\nyou any longer.\"\\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling.

I was happier on the lawns because I had on\\nshoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the\\nsoft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the\\nwind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in\\nfront of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,\\nin a disapproving way.\\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\\nDaisy Fay\\'s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long\\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that\\nnight. \"Anyways, for an hour!\"\\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was\\nbeside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had\\nnever seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she\\ndidn\\'t see me until I was five feet away.\\n\"Hello, Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the\\nolder girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red\\nCross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she\\ncouldn\\'t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was\\nspeaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at\\nsometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the\\nincident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn\\'t lay eyes on\\nhim again for over four years—even after I\\'d met him on Long Island I\\ndidn\\'t realize it was the same man.\\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux\\nmyself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn\\'t see Daisy very\\noften. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone\\nat all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had\\nfound her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say\\ngoodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually\\nprevented, but she wasn\\'t on speaking terms with her family for\\nseveral weeks. After that she didn\\'t play around with the soldiers any\\nmore, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,\\nwho couldn\\'t get into the army at all.\\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début\\nafter the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,\\nwith more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He\\ncame down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a\\nwhole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he\\ngave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand\\ndollars.\\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the\\nbridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June\\nnight in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle\\nof Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\\n\"\\u200a\\'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before, but oh how\\nI do enjoy it.\"\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Daisy?\"\\nI was scared, I can tell you; I\\'d never seen a girl like that before.\\n\"Here, dearies.\" She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her\\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take \\'em downstairs\\nand give \\'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell \\'em all Daisy\\'s\\nchange\\' her mine. Say: \\'Daisy\\'s change\\' her mine!\\'\\u200a\"\\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\\nmother\\'s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.\\nShe wouldn\\'t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her\\nand squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\\nsoap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\\nBut she didn\\'t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and\\nput ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half\\nan hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around\\nher neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o\\'clock she\\nmarried Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a\\nthree months\\' trip to the South Seas.\\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I\\'d\\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\\nminute she\\'d look around uneasily, and say: \"Where\\'s Tom gone?\" and\\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the\\nhour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with\\nunfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you\\nlaugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I\\nleft Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,\\nand ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got\\ninto the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the\\nchambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for\\na year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and\\nthen they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in\\nChicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young\\nand rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect\\nreputation. Perhaps because she doesn\\'t drink. It\\'s a great advantage\\nnot to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,\\nmoreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that\\neverybody else is so blind that they don\\'t see or care. Perhaps Daisy\\nnever went in for amour at all—and yet there\\'s something in that voice\\nof hers …\\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first\\ntime in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew\\nGatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and\\nwoke me up, and said: \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him—I was\\nhalf asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man\\nshe used to know. It wasn\\'t until then that I connected this Gatsby\\nwith the officer in her white car.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\\nfor half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.\\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\\nthe West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered\\nlike crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\\n\"I\\'m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when\\nyou\\'re asleep Into your tent I\\'ll creep—\"\\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\\n\"But it wasn\\'t a coincidence at all.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that\\nJune night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of\\nhis purposeless splendour.\\n\"He wants to know,\" continued Jordan, \"if you\\'ll invite Daisy to your\\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and\\nbought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that\\nhe could \"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger\\'s garden.\\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\\n\"He\\'s afraid, he\\'s waited so long. He thought you might be\\noffended. You see, he\\'s regular tough underneath it all.\"\\nSomething worried me.\\n\"Why didn\\'t he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is\\nright next door.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some\\nnight,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It\\nwas that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard\\nthe elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\\nsuggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he\\'d go mad:\\n\"\\u200a\\'I don\\'t want to do anything out of the way!\\' he kept saying. \\'I\\nwant to see her right next door.\\'\\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom\\'s, he started to\\nabandon the whole idea. He doesn\\'t know very much about Tom, though he\\nsays he\\'s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of\\ncatching a glimpse of Daisy\\'s name.\"\\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\\naround Jordan\\'s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her\\nto dinner. Suddenly I wasn\\'t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,\\nbut of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal\\nscepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady\\nexcitement: \"There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and\\nthe tired.\"\\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to\\nme.\\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\\n\"She\\'s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn\\'t want her to know. You\\'re\\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\\nmy house was on fire. Two o\\'clock and the whole corner of the\\npeninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery\\nand made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a\\ncorner, I saw that it was Gatsby\\'s house, lit from tower to cellar.\\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn\\'t a sound. Only wind in\\nthe trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on\\nagain as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned\\naway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\\n\"Your place looks like the World\\'s Fair,\" I said.\\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been\\nglancing into some of the rooms. Let\\'s go to Coney Island, old\\nsport. In my car.\"\\n\"It\\'s too late.\"\\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven\\'t made\\nuse of it all summer.\"\\n\"I\\'ve got to go to bed.\"\\n\"All right.\"\\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I\\'m going to call\\nup Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don\\'t want to put you\\nto any trouble.\"\\n\"What day would suit you?\"\\n\"What day would suit you?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don\\'t want to\\nput you to any trouble, you see.\"\\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\"\\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: \"I want to get the\\ngrass cut,\" he said.\\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my\\nragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I\\nsuspected that he meant my grass.\\n\"There\\'s another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\\n\"Oh, it isn\\'t about that. At least—\" He fumbled with a series of\\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don\\'t make\\nmuch money, do you?\"\\n\"Not very much.\"\\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\\n\"I thought you didn\\'t, if you\\'ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a\\nlittle business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And\\nI thought that if you don\\'t make very much—You\\'re selling bonds,\\naren\\'t you, old sport?\"\\n\"Trying to.\"\\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn\\'t take up much of your time\\nand you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather\\nconfidential sort of thing.\"\\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation\\nmight have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer\\nwas obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no\\nchoice except to cut him off there.\\n\"I\\'ve got my hands full,\" I said. \"I\\'m much obliged but I couldn\\'t\\ntake on any more work.\"\\n\"You wouldn\\'t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.\" Evidently he\\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at\\nlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,\\nhoping I\\'d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be\\nresponsive, so he went unwillingly home.',\n",

However, as calmness wasn\\'t an end in\\nitself, I made an excuse at the first possible moment, and got to my\\nfeet.\\n\"Where are you going?\" demanded Gatsby in immediate alarm.\\n\"I\\'ll be back.\"\\n\"I\\'ve got to speak to you about something before you go.\"\\nHe followed me wildly into the kitchen, closed the door, and\\nwhispered: \"Oh, God!\" in a miserable way.\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\"This is a terrible mistake,\" he said, shaking his head from side to\\nside, \"a terrible, terrible mistake.\"\\n\"You\\'re just embarrassed, that\\'s all,\" and luckily I added: \"Daisy\\'s\\nembarrassed too.\"\\n\"She\\'s embarrassed?\" he repeated incredulously.\\n\"Just as much as you are.\"\\n\"Don\\'t talk so loud.\"\\n\"You\\'re acting like a little boy,\" I broke out impatiently. \"Not only\\nthat, but you\\'re rude.

Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\\nGatsby\\'s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\\nGatsby\\'s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he\\'d agreed to pay\\nfive years\\' taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would\\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate\\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on\\nthe door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have\\nalways been obstinate about being peasantry.\\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer\\'s automobile\\nrounded Gatsby\\'s drive with the raw material for his servants\\'\\ndinner—I felt sure he wouldn\\'t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening\\nthe upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,\\nleaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the\\ngarden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had\\nseemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little\\nnow and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that\\nsilence had fallen within the house too.\\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of\\npushing over the stove—but I don\\'t believe they heard a sound. They\\nwere sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if\\nsome question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of\\nembarrassment was gone.

It\\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby\\'s own\\napartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam\\'s study, where we sat\\ndown and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in\\nthe wall.\\nHe hadn\\'t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued\\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his\\npossessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding\\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\\nflight of stairs.\\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was\\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\\nwith delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\\n\"It\\'s the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I\\ncan\\'t—When I try to—\"\\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a\\nthird. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed\\nwith wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,\\ndreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to\\nspeak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,\\nhe was running down like an over-wound clock.\\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\\n\"I\\'ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a\\nselection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,\\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,\\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\\nmany-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\\nrich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of\\nindian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\\n\"They\\'re such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I\\'ve never seen such—such\\nbeautiful shirts before.\"',\n",

       "   'text': \"James Gatz—that was really, or at least legally, his name. He had\\nchanged it at the age of seventeen and at the specific moment that\\nwitnessed the beginning of his career—when he saw Dan Cody's yacht\\ndrop anchor over the most insidious flat on Lake Superior. It was\\nJames Gatz who had been loafing along the beach that afternoon in a\\ntorn green jersey and a pair of canvas pants, but it was already Jay\\nGatsby who borrowed a rowboat, pulled out to the Tuolomee, and\\ninformed Cody that a wind might catch him and break him up in half an\\nhour.\\nI suppose he'd had the name ready for a long time, even then. His\\nparents were shiftless and unsuccessful farm people—his imagination\\nhad never really accepted them as his parents at all. The truth was\\nthat Jay Gatsby of West Egg, Long Island, sprang from his Platonic\\nconception of himself. He was a son of God—a phrase which, if it means\\nanything, means just that—and he must be about His Father's business,\\nthe service of a vast, vulgar, and meretricious beauty. So he invented\\njust the sort of Jay Gatsby that a seventeen-year-old boy would be\\nlikely to invent, and to this conception he was faithful to the end.\\nFor over a year he had been beating his way along the south shore of\\nLake Superior as a clam-digger and a salmon-fisher or in any other\\ncapacity that brought him food and bed. His brown, hardening body\\nlived naturally through the half-fierce, half-lazy work of the bracing\\ndays. He knew women early, and since they spoiled him he became\\ncontemptuous of them, of young virgins because they were ignorant, of\\nthe others because they were hysterical about things which in his\\noverwhelming self-absorption he took for granted.\\nBut his heart was in a constant, turbulent riot. The most grotesque\\nand fantastic conceits haunted him in his bed at night. A universe of\\nineffable gaudiness spun itself out in his brain while the clock\\nticked on the washstand and the moon soaked with wet light his tangled\\nclothes upon the floor. Each night he added to the pattern of his\\nfancies until drowsiness closed down upon some vivid scene with an\\noblivious embrace. For a while these reveries provided an outlet for\\nhis imagination; they were a satisfactory hint of the unreality of\\nreality, a promise that the rock of the world was founded securely on\\na fairy's wing.\\nAn instinct toward his future glory had led him, some months before,\\nto the small Lutheran College of St. Olaf's in southern Minnesota. He\\nstayed there two weeks, dismayed at its ferocious indifference to the\\ndrums of his destiny, to destiny itself, and despising the janitor's\\nwork with which he was to pay his way through. Then he drifted back to\\nLake Superior, and he was still searching for something to do on the\\nday that Dan Cody's yacht dropped anchor in the shallows alongshore.\\nCody was fifty years old then, a product of the Nevada silver fields,\\nof the Yukon, of every rush for metal since seventy-five. The\\ntransactions in Montana copper that made him many times a millionaire\\nfound him physically robust but on the verge of soft-mindedness, and,\\nsuspecting this, an infinite number of women tried to separate him\\nfrom his money. The none too savoury ramifications by which Ella Kaye,\\nthe newspaper woman, played Madame de Maintenon to his weakness and\\nsent him to sea in a yacht, were common property of the turgid\\njournalism in 1902. He had been coasting along all too hospitable\\nshores for five years when he turned up as James Gatz's destiny in\\nLittle Girl Bay.\\nTo young Gatz, resting on his oars and looking up at the railed deck,\\nthat yacht represented all the beauty and glamour in the world. I\\nsuppose he smiled at Cody—he had probably discovered that people liked\\nhim when he smiled. At any rate Cody asked him a few questions (one of\\nthem elicited the brand new name) and found that he was quick and\\nextravagantly ambitious. A few days later he took him to Duluth and\\nbought him a blue coat, six pairs of white duck trousers, and a\\nyachting cap. And when the Tuolomee left for the West Indies and the\\nBarbary Coast, Gatsby left too.\\nHe was employed in a vague personal capacity—while he remained with\\nCody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary, and even\\njailor, for Dan Cody sober knew what lavish doings Dan Cody drunk\\nmight soon be about, and he provided for such contingencies by\\nreposing more and more trust in Gatsby. The arrangement lasted five\\nyears, during which the boat went three times around the Continent.\\nIt might have lasted indefinitely except for the fact that Ella Kaye\\ncame on board one night in Boston and a week later Dan Cody\\ninhospitably died.\\nI remember the portrait of him up in Gatsby's bedroom, a grey, florid\\nman with a hard, empty face—the pioneer debauchee, who during one\\nphase of American life brought back to the Eastern seaboard the savage\\nviolence of the frontier brothel and saloon. It was indirectly due to\\nCody that Gatsby drank so little. Sometimes in the course of gay\\nparties women used to rub champagne into his hair; for himself he\\nformed the habit of letting liquor alone.\\nAnd it was from Cody that he inherited money—a legacy of twenty-five\\nthousand dollars. He didn't get it. He never understood the legal\\ndevice that was used against him, but what remained of the millions\\nwent intact to Ella Kaye. He was left with his singularly appropriate\\neducation; the vague contour of Jay Gatsby had filled out to the\",\n",

I wouldn\\'t be surprised if some other people dropped\\nin from New York.\"\\n\"You come to supper with me,\" said the lady enthusiastically. \"Both of\\nyou.\"\\nThis included me. Mr. Sloane got to his feet.\\n\"Come along,\" he said—but to her only.\\n\"I mean it,\" she insisted. \"I\\'d love to have you. Lots of room.\"\\nGatsby looked at me questioningly. He wanted to go and he didn\\'t see\\nthat Mr. Sloane had determined he shouldn\\'t.\\n\"I\\'m afraid I won\\'t be able to,\" I said.\\n\"Well, you come,\" she urged, concentrating on Gatsby.\\nMr. Sloane murmured something close to her ear.\\n\"We won\\'t be late if we start now,\" she insisted aloud.\\n\"I haven\\'t got a horse,\" said Gatsby. \"I used to ride in the army, but\\nI\\'ve never bought a horse.

       "   'text': 'Her glance left me and sought the lighted top of the steps, where\\n\"Three O\\'Clock in the Morning,\" a neat, sad little waltz of that year,\\nwas drifting out the open door. After all, in the very casualness of\\nGatsby\\'s party there were romantic possibilities totally absent from\\nher world. What was it up there in the song that seemed to be calling\\nher back inside? What would happen now in the dim, incalculable hours?\\nPerhaps some unbelievable guest would arrive, a person infinitely rare\\nand to be marvelled at, some authentically radiant young girl who with\\none fresh glance at Gatsby, one moment of magical encounter, would\\nblot out those five years of unwavering devotion.\\nI stayed late that night. Gatsby asked me to wait until he was free,\\nand I lingered in the garden until the inevitable swimming party had\\nrun up, chilled and exalted, from the black beach, until the lights\\nwere extinguished in the guestrooms overhead. When he came down the\\nsteps at last the tanned skin was drawn unusually tight on his face,\\nand his eyes were bright and tired.\\n\"She didn\\'t like it,\" he said immediately.\\n\"Of course she did.\"\\n\"She didn\\'t like it,\" he insisted. \"She didn\\'t have a good time.\"\\nHe was silent, and I guessed at his unutterable depression.\\n\"I feel far away from her,\" he said. \"It\\'s hard to make her\\nunderstand.\"\\n\"You mean about the dance?\"\\n\"The dance?\" He dismissed all the dances he had given with a snap of\\nhis fingers. \"Old sport, the dance is unimportant.\"\\nHe wanted nothing less of Daisy than that she should go to Tom and\\nsay: \"I never loved you.\" After she had obliterated four years with\\nthat sentence they could decide upon the more practical measures to be\\ntaken. One of them was that, after she was free, they were to go back\\nto Louisville and be married from her house—just as if it were five\\nyears ago.\\n\"And she doesn\\'t understand,\" he said. \"She used to be able to\\nunderstand. We\\'d sit for hours—\"\\nHe broke off and began to walk up and down a desolate path of fruit\\nrinds and discarded favours and crushed flowers.\\n\"I wouldn\\'t ask too much of her,\" I ventured. \"You can\\'t repeat the\\npast.\"\\n\"Can\\'t repeat the past?\" he cried incredulously. \"Why of course you\\ncan!\"\\nHe looked around him wildly, as if the past were lurking here in the\\nshadow of his house, just out of reach of his hand.\\n\"I\\'m going to fix everything just the way it was before,\" he said,\\nnodding determinedly. \"She\\'ll see.\"\\nHe talked a lot about the past, and I gathered that he wanted to\\nrecover something, some idea of himself perhaps, that had gone into\\nloving Daisy. His life had been confused and disordered since then,\\nbut if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it\\nall slowly, he could find out what that thing was …\\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the\\nstreet when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They\\nstopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes\\nof the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really\\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could\\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy\\'s white face came up to his own. He\\nknew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable\\nvisions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like\\nthe mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the\\ntuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At\\nhis lips\\' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\\nincarnation was complete.\\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\\nreminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,\\nthat I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase\\ntried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man\\'s,\\nas though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled\\nair. But they made no sound, and what I had almost remembered was\\nuncommunicable forever.',\n",

       "   'text': 'from the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked\\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered\\nover and over in a gasping moan.\\n\"There\\'s some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\\ngarage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal\\nbasket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a\\nviolent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way\\nthrough.\\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\\nderanged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\\nMyrtle Wilson\\'s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another\\nblanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on\\na worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\\nover it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking\\ndown names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\\ncouldn\\'t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\\nclamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the\\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\\nvoice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his\\nshoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly\\nfrom the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk\\nback to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,\\nhorrible call:\\n\"Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around\\nthe garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to\\nthe policeman.\\n\"M-a-v—\" the policeman was saying, \"—o—\"\\n\"No, r—\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o—\"\\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\\n\"r—\" said the policeman, \"o—\"\\n\"g—\"\\n\"g—\" He looked up as Tom\\'s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\\n\"What you want, fella?\"\\n\"What happened?—that\\'s what I want to know.\"\\n\"Auto hit her. Ins\\'antly killed.\"\\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn\\'t even stopus car.\"\\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin\\', one goin\\', see?\"\\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\\n\"One goin\\' each way. Well, she\"—his hand rose toward the blankets but\\nstopped halfway and fell to his side—\"she ran out there an\\' the one\\ncomin\\' from N\\'York knock right into her, goin\\' thirty or forty miles\\nan hour.\"\\n\"What\\'s the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\\n\"Hasn\\'t got any name.\"\\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster\\'n forty. Going\\nfifty, sixty.\"\\n\"Come here and let\\'s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\\nname.\"\\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in\\nthe office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his\\ngrasping cries:\\n\"You don\\'t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind\\nof car it was!\"\\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in\\nfront of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\\n\"You\\'ve got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\\ngruffness.\\nWilson\\'s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute\\nago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we\\'ve been talking\\nabout. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn\\'t mine—do you\\nhear? I haven\\'t seen it all afternoon.\"\\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the\\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\\neyes.\\n\"What\\'s all that?\" he demanded.\\n\"I\\'m a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\\nWilson\\'s body. \"He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow\\ncar.\"\\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\\n\"And what colour\\'s your car?\"\\n\"It\\'s a blue car, a coupé.\"\\n\"We\\'ve come straight from New York,\" I said.\\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and\\nthe policeman turned away.\\n\"Now, if you\\'ll let me have that name again correct—\"\\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set\\nhim down in a chair, and came back.\\n\"If somebody\\'ll come here and sit with him,\" he snapped\\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered: \"Let\\'s get out.\"\\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down\\nhard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I\\nheard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down\\nhis face.\\n\"The God damned coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn\\'t even stop his car.\"',\n",

I must have felt pretty weird\\nby that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity\\nof his pink suit under the moon.\\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was\\ngoing to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn\\'t have been surprised to\\nsee sinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfshiem\\'s people,\" behind him in\\nthe dark shrubbery.\\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nHe hesitated.\\n\"Was she killed?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It\\'s better that the shock\\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\\nHe spoke as if Daisy\\'s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in\\nmy garage. I don\\'t think anybody saw us, but of course I can\\'t be\\nsure.\"\\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn\\'t find it necessary to\\ntell him he was wrong.\\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did\\nit happen?\"\\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel—\" He broke off, and suddenly I\\nguessed at the truth.\\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I\\'ll say I was. You see,\\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\\nsteady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but\\nit seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were\\nsomebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward\\nthe other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second\\nmy hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her\\ninstantly.\"\\n\"It ripped her open—\"\\n\"Don\\'t tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I\\ntried to make her stop, but she couldn\\'t, so I pulled on the emergency\\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\\n\"She\\'ll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I\\'m just going to\\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\\nthis afternoon. She\\'s locked herself into her room, and if he tries\\nany brutality she\\'s going to turn the light out and on again.\"\\n\"He won\\'t touch her,\" I said. \"He\\'s not thinking about her.\"\\n\"I don\\'t trust him, old sport.\"\\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\\n\"All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.\"\\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy\\nhad been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might\\nthink anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright\\nwindows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy\\'s room on the ground\\nfloor.\\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I\\'ll see if there\\'s any sign of a\\ncommotion.\"\\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel\\nsoftly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains\\nwere open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where\\nwe had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small\\nrectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind\\nwas drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,\\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of\\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his\\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\\nThey weren\\'t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\\nale—and yet they weren\\'t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\\nof natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said\\nthat they were conspiring together.\\nAs I tiptoed from the porch I heard my taxi feeling its way along the\\ndark road toward the house. Gatsby was waiting where I had left him in\\nthe drive.\\n\"Is it all quiet up there?\" he asked anxiously.\\n\"Yes, it\\'s all quiet.\" I hesitated. \"You\\'d better come home and get\\nsome sleep.\"\\nHe shook his head.\\n\"I want to wait here till Daisy goes to bed. Good night, old sport.\"\\nHe put his hands in his coat pockets and turned back eagerly to his\\nscrutiny of the house, as though my presence marred the sacredness of\\nthe vigil. So I walked away and left him standing there in the\\nmoonlight—watching over nothing.',\n",

A rope stretched\\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and\\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the\\npool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\\nexpression \"madman\" as he bent over Wilson\\'s body that afternoon, and\\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\\nreports next morning.\\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,\\neager, and untrue. When Michaelis\\'s testimony at the inquest brought\\nto light Wilson\\'s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale\\nwould shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might\\nhave said anything, didn\\'t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\\nof character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes\\nunder that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never\\nseen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,\\nthat her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced\\nherself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very\\nsuggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\\nman \"deranged by grief\" in order that the case might remain in its\\nsimplest form. And it rested there.\\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself\\non Gatsby\\'s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the\\ncatastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every\\npractical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn\\'t move or breathe or\\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because\\nno one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense\\npersonal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\\n\"Left no address?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Say when they\\'d be back?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. Can\\'t say.\"\\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where\\nhe lay and reassure him: \"I\\'ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don\\'t\\nworry. Just trust me and I\\'ll get somebody for you—\"\\nMeyer Wolfshiem\\'s name wasn\\'t in the phone book. The butler gave me\\nhis office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the\\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the\\nphone.\\n\"Will you ring again?\"\\n\"I\\'ve rung three times.\"\\n\"It\\'s very important.\"\\n\"Sorry. I\\'m afraid no one\\'s there.\"\\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they\\nwere chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled\\nit. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\\n\"Look here, old sport, you\\'ve got to get somebody for me. You\\'ve got\\nto try hard. I can\\'t go through this alone.\"\\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going\\nupstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he\\'d\\nnever told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was\\nnothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,\\nstaring down from the wall.\\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,\\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure\\nhe\\'d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there\\'d be a\\nwire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem\\narrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and',\n",

He had reached an age where death no longer has the\\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\\nfirst time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great\\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be\\nmixed with an awed pride.

I made him.\"\\n\"Oh.\"\\n\"I raised him up out of nothing, right out of the gutter. I saw right\\naway he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\\nme he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good. I got him to join\\nthe American Legion and he used to stand high there. Right off he did\\nsome work for a client of mine up to Albany.

It\\'s all over now.\"\\n\"When a man gets killed I never like to get mixed up in it in any\\nway. I keep out.

You may\\nthink that\\'s sentimental, but I mean it—to the bitter end.\"\\nI saw that for some reason of his own he was determined not to come,\\nso I stood up.\\n\"Are you a college man?\" he inquired suddenly.\\nFor a moment I thought he was going to suggest a \"gonnegtion,\" but he\\nonly nodded and shook my hand.\\n\"Let us learn to show our friendship for a man when he is alive and\\nnot after he is dead,\" he suggested. \"After that my own rule is to let\\neverything alone.\"',\n",

The rain poured down his thick glasses, and\\nhe took them off and wiped them to see the protecting canvas unrolled\\nfrom Gatsby\\'s grave.\\nI tried to think about Gatsby then for a moment, but he was already\\ntoo far away, and I could only remember, without resentment, that\\nDaisy hadn\\'t sent a message or a flower. Dimly I heard someone murmur\\n\"Blessed are the dead that the rain falls on,\" and then the owl-eyed\\nman said \"Amen to that,\" in a brave voice.\\nWe straggled down quickly through the rain to the cars. Owl-eyes spoke\\nto me by the gate.\\n\"I couldn\\'t get to the house,\" he remarked.\\n\"Neither could anybody else.\"\\n\"Go on!\" He started. \"Why, my God! they used to go there by the\\nhundreds.\"\\nHe took off his glasses and wiped them again, outside and in.\\n\"The poor son-of-a-bitch,\" he said.',\n",

       "   'text': 'One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school\\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o\\'clock of a\\nDecember evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into\\ntheir own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That\\'s and the\\nchatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught\\nsight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: \"Are you\\ngoing to the Ordways\\'? the Herseys\\'? the Schultzes\\'?\" and the long\\ngreen tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky\\nyellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking\\ncheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and\\nthe dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild\\nbrace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we\\nwalked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware\\nof our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we\\nmelted indistinguishably into it again.\\nThat\\'s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\\ntowns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street\\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\\nstill called through decades by a family\\'s name. I see now that this\\nhas been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\\nchildren and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of\\ndistortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic\\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\\nhouse—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman\\'s name, and no one\\ncares.\\nAfter Gatsby\\'s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\\nbeyond my eyes\\' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\\nline I decided to come back home.\\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\\naround what had happened to us together, and what had happened\\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big\\nchair.\\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like\\na good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the\\ncolour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the\\nfingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without\\ncomment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though\\nthere were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I\\npretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn\\'t\\nmaking a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up\\nto say goodbye.\\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw\\nme over on the telephone. I don\\'t give a damn about you now, but it\\nwas a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\\nWe shook hands.\\n\"Oh, and do you remember\"—she added—\"a conversation we had once about\\ndriving a car?\"\\n\"Why—not exactly.\"\\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn\\'t I? I mean it was careless of me\\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\\n\"I\\'m thirty,\" I said. \"I\\'m five years too old to lie to myself and\\ncall it honour.\"\\nShe didn\\'t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\\nsorry, I turned away.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as\\nI slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\\nthe windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,\\nholding out his hand.\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\\n\"You\\'re crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don\\'t know\\nwhat\\'s the matter with you.\"\\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about\\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after\\nme and grabbed my arm.\\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\\ngetting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren\\'t in\\nhe tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if\\nI hadn\\'t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\\npocket every minute he was in the house—\" He broke off defiantly.\\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy\\'s, but he was a tough\\none. He ran over Myrtle like you\\'d run over a dog and never even\\nstopped his car.\"\\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it\\nwasn\\'t true.\\n\"And if you think I didn\\'t have my share of suffering—look here, when\\nI went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits\\nsitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By\\nGod it was awful—\"\\nI couldn\\'t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done\\nwas, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and\\nconfused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up\\nthings and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their\\nvast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let\\nother people clean up the mess they had made …\\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery\\nstore to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff\\nbuttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGatsby\\'s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had\\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\\nEast Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story\\nabout it all his own. I didn\\'t want to hear it and I avoided him when\\nI got off the train.\\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,\\ndazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still\\nhear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,\\nand the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a\\nmaterial car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I\\ndidn\\'t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away\\nat the ends of the earth and didn\\'t know that the party was over.\\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,\\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the\\nSound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to\\nmelt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that\\nflowered once for Dutch sailors\\' eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new\\nworld. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\\'s\\nhouse, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all\\nhuman dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his\\nbreath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic\\ncontemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the\\nlast time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for\\nwonder.\\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\\nGatsby\\'s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\\nDaisy\\'s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream\\nmust have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He\\ndid not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that\\nvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic\\nrolled on under the night.\\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\\'s no\\nmatter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And\\none fine morning—\\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into',\n",
