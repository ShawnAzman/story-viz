Every friend of Miss Taylor\\nmust be glad to have her so happily married.\"\\n\"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,\" said Emma, \"and a\\nvery considerable one—that I made the match myself.

The boy\\nhad, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his\\nmother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs.\\nChurchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young\\ncreature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge\\nof the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some\\nreluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they\\nwere overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the\\ncare and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort\\nto seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.\\nA complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and\\nengaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in\\nLondon, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which\\nbrought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury,\\nwhere most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful\\noccupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty\\nyears of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time,\\nrealised an easy competence—enough to secure the purchase of a little\\nestate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for—enough to\\nmarry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according\\nto the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.\\nIt was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his\\nschemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it\\nhad not shaken his determination of never settling till he could\\npurchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to;\\nbut he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were\\naccomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained\\nhis wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every\\nprobability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had\\nnever been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that,\\neven in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful\\na well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the\\npleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be\\nchosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.\\nHe had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own;\\nfor as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his\\nuncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume\\nthe name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely,\\ntherefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance. His father\\nhad no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and\\ngoverned her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to\\nimagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear,\\nand, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in\\nLondon, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine\\nyoung man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was\\nlooked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and\\nprospects a kind of common concern.\",\n",

And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance\\nof Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female\\nwalking, and in Mr. Weston\\'s disposition and circumstances, which would\\nmake the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the\\nevenings in the week together.\\nHer situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs.\\nWeston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction—her more\\nthan satisfaction—her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent,\\nthat Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize\\nat his being still able to pity \\'poor Miss Taylor,\\' when they left her\\nat Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away\\nin the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her\\nown. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse\\'s giving a gentle sigh,\\nand saying, \"Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.\"\\nThere was no recovering Miss Taylor—nor much likelihood of ceasing to\\npity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.\\nThe compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by\\nbeing wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which\\nhad been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could\\nbear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be\\ndifferent from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as\\nunfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade\\nthem from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as\\nearnestly tried to prevent any body\\'s eating it. He had been at the\\npains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr.\\nPerry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were\\none of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse\\'s life; and upon being applied to,\\nhe could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias\\nof inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with\\nmany—perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an\\nopinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence\\nevery visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten;\\nand there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.',\n",

Had it taken place only once a year, it\\nwould have been a grievance.\\nMrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old\\nlady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She lived with her\\nsingle daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the\\nregard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward\\ncircumstances, can excite. Her daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree\\nof popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married.\\nMiss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having\\nmuch of the public favour; and she had no intellectual superiority to\\nmake atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her into\\noutward respect. She had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her\\nyouth had passed without distinction, and her middle of life was\\ndevoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a\\nsmall income go as far as possible. And yet she was a happy woman, and\\na woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her own universal\\ngood-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She loved\\nevery body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to\\nevery body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and\\nsurrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good\\nneighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The\\nsimplicity and cheerfulness of her nature, her contented and grateful\\nspirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to\\nherself. She was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly\\nsuited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless\\ngossip.\",\n",

Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three\\nteachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with\\nher.\"\\n\"Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of\\nhis own business? He does not read?\"\\n\"Oh yes!—that is, no—I do not know—but I believe he has read a good\\ndeal—but not what you would think any thing of. He reads the\\nAgricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the\\nwindow seats—but he reads all _them_ to himself. But sometimes of an\\nevening, before we went to cards, he would read something aloud out of\\nthe Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he has read the\\nVicar of Wakefield. He never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The\\nChildren of the Abbey. He had never heard of such books before I\\nmentioned them, but he is determined to get them now as soon as ever he\\ncan.\"\\nThe next question was—\\n\"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?\"\\n\"Oh! not handsome—not at all handsome. I thought him very plain at\\nfirst, but I do not think him so plain now. One does not, you know,\\nafter a time. But did you never see him? He is in Highbury every now\\nand then, and he is sure to ride through every week in his way to\\nKingston. He has passed you very often.\"\\n\"That may be, and I may have seen him fifty times, but without having\\nany idea of his name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot,\\nis the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are\\nprecisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to\\ndo. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest\\nme; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.\\nBut a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense,\\nas much above my notice as in every other he is below it.\"\\n\"To be sure.

But while I visit at Hartfield,\\nand you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any\\nbody can do.\"\\n\"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I\\nwould have you so firmly established in good society, as to be\\nindependent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you\\npermanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to\\nhave as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if\\nyou should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you\\nmay not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted\\nwith the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer\\'s daughter,\\nwithout education.\"\\n\"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body\\nbut what had had some education—and been very well brought up. However,\\nI do not mean to set up my opinion against yours—and I am sure I shall\\nnot wish for the acquaintance of his wife. I shall always have a great\\nregard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very\\nsorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But\\nif he marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not\\nvisit her, if I can help it.\"\\nEmma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no\\nalarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer,\\nbut she trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no\\nserious difficulty, on Harriet\\'s side, to oppose any friendly\\narrangement of her own.\\nThey met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the\\nDonwell road. He was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at\\nher, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. Emma was\\nnot sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few\\nyards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye\\nsufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His appearance was very\\nneat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no\\nother advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she\\nthought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet\\'s\\ninclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily\\nnoticed her father\\'s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr.\\nMartin looked as if he did not know what manner was.\\nThey remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be\\nkept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her with a smiling face,\\nand in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to\\ncompose.\\n\"Only think of our happening to meet him!—How very odd! It was quite a\\nchance, he said, that he had not gone round by Randalls. He did not\\nthink we ever walked this road. He thought we walked towards Randalls\\nmost days. He has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.\\nHe was so busy the last time he was at Kingston that he quite forgot\\nit, but he goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet!\\nWell, Miss Woodhouse, is he like what you expected? What do you think\\nof him? Do you think him so very plain?\"\\n\"He is very plain, undoubtedly—remarkably plain:—but that is nothing\\ncompared with his entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect\\nmuch, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he could be so\\nvery clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him, I confess, a\\ndegree or two nearer gentility.\"\\n\"To be sure,\" said Harriet, in a mortified voice, \"he is not so genteel\\nas real gentlemen.\"\\n\"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been\\nrepeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you\\nmust yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At\\nHartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred\\nmen. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in\\ncompany with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him to be a very\\ninferior creature—and rather wondering at yourself for having ever\\nthought him at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now?\\nWere not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his awkward\\nlook and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to\\nbe wholly unmodulated as I stood here.\"\\n\"Certainly, he is not like Mr. Knightley. He has not such a fine air\\nand way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough.\\nBut Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!\"\\n\"Mr. Knightley\\'s air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to\\ncompare Mr. Martin with _him_. You might not see one in a hundred with\\n_gentleman_ so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he is not the\\nonly gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston\\nand Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of _them_. Compare their\\nmanner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being\\nsilent. You must see the difference.\"\\n\"Oh yes!—there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old\\nman. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.\"\\n\"Which makes his good manners the more valuable. The older a person\\ngrows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not\\nbe bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or\\nawkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later\\nage. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he be at Mr.\\nWeston\\'s time of life?\"\\n\"There is no saying, indeed,\" replied Harriet rather solemnly.\\n\"But there may be pretty good guessing. He will be a completely gross,\\nvulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of\\nnothing but profit and loss.\"\\n\"Will he, indeed? That will be very bad.\"\\n\"How much his business engrosses him already is very plain from the\\ncircumstance of his forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.\\nHe was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing\\nelse—which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he to\\ndo with books? And I have no doubt that he _will_ thrive, and be a very\\nrich man in time—and his being illiterate and coarse need not disturb\\n_us_.\"\\n\"I wonder he did not remember the book\"—was all Harriet\\'s answer, and\\nspoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be\\nsafely left to itself. She, therefore, said no more for some time. Her\\nnext beginning was,\\n\"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton\\'s manners are superior to Mr.\\nKnightley\\'s or Mr. Weston\\'s. They have more gentleness. They might be\\nmore safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness,\\nalmost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in _him_,\\nbecause there is so much good-humour with it—but that would not do to\\nbe copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley\\'s downright, decided, commanding\\nsort of manner, though it suits _him_ very well; his figure, and look,\\nand situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to\\nset about copying him, he would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I\\nthink a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as\\na model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He\\nseems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know\\nwhether he has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us,\\nHarriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his manners are\\nsofter than they used to be. If he means any thing, it must be to\\nplease you. Did not I tell you what he said of you the other day?\"\\nShe then repeated some warm personal praise which she had drawn from\\nMr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled,\\nand said she had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.\\nMr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young\\nfarmer out of Harriet\\'s head. She thought it would be an excellent\\nmatch; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her\\nto have much merit in planning it. She feared it was what every body\\nelse must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any\\nbody should have equalled her in the date of the plan, as it had\\nentered her brain during the very first evening of Harriet\\'s coming to\\nHartfield. The longer she considered it, the greater was her sense of\\nits expediency. Mr. Elton\\'s situation was most suitable, quite the\\ngentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of\\nany family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.\\nHe had a comfortable home for her, and Emma imagined a very sufficient\\nincome; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he was known\\nto have some independent property; and she thought very highly of him\\nas a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any\\ndeficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.\\nShe had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful\\ngirl, which she trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was\\nfoundation enough on his side; and on Harriet\\'s there could be little\\ndoubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual\\nweight and efficacy. And he was really a very pleasing young man, a\\nyoung man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He was reckoned\\nvery handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her,\\nthere being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense\\nwith:—but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin\\'s riding\\nabout the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered\\nby Mr. Elton\\'s admiration.',\n",

But still\\nI cannot imagine she would not be persuaded.\"\\nHarriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made;\\nand she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the\\nearnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work\\ndirectly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various\\nattempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that\\nthey might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many\\nbeginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths,\\npencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had\\nalways wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in\\ndrawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as\\nshe would ever submit to. She played and sang;—and drew in almost every\\nstyle; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she\\napproached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to\\ncommand, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as\\nto her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not\\nunwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for\\naccomplishment often higher than it deserved.\\nThere was merit in every drawing—in the least finished, perhaps the\\nmost; her style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had\\nthere been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her two\\ncompanions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A\\nlikeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse\\'s performances must be\\ncapital.\\n\"No great variety of faces for you,\" said Emma. \"I had only my own\\nfamily to study from. There is my father—another of my father—but the\\nidea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only\\ntake him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston\\nagain, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my\\nkindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her.\\nThere is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure!—and\\nthe face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she\\nwould have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her\\nfour children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my\\nattempts at three of those four children;—there they are, Henry and\\nJohn and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of\\nthem might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them\\ndrawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three\\nor four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take\\nany likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are\\ncoarser featured than any of mama\\'s children ever were. Here is my\\nsketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on\\nthe sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would\\nwish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That\\'s\\nvery like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa\\nis very good. Then here is my last,\"—unclosing a pretty sketch of a\\ngentleman in small size, whole-length—\"my last and my best—my brother,\\nMr. John Knightley.—This did not want much of being finished, when I\\nput it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I\\ncould not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had\\nreally made a very good likeness of it—(Mrs. Weston and I were quite\\nagreed in thinking it _very_ like)—only too handsome—too flattering—but\\nthat was a fault on the right side\"—after all this, came poor dear\\nIsabella\\'s cold approbation of—\"Yes, it was a little like—but to be\\nsure it did not do him justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in\\npersuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and\\naltogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish\\nit, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every\\nmorning visitor in Brunswick Square;—and, as I said, I did then\\nforswear ever drawing any body again.

Exactly so. No husbands and wives,\" with so interesting a\\nconsciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she had not better\\nleave them together at once. But as she wanted to be drawing, the\\ndeclaration must wait a little longer.\\nShe had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a\\nwhole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley\\'s, and was\\ndestined, if she could please herself, to hold a very honourable\\nstation over the mantelpiece.\\nThe sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not\\nkeeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of\\nyouthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no\\ndoing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every\\ntouch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze\\nand gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to\\nit, and request him to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her\\nto employ him in reading.\\n\"If he would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness\\nindeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her part, and lessen\\nthe irksomeness of Miss Smith\\'s.\"\\nMr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace.\\nShe must allow him to be still frequently coming to look; any thing\\nless would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he was ready\\nat the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the\\nprogress, and be charmed.—There was no being displeased with such an\\nencourager, for his admiration made him discern a likeness almost\\nbefore it was possible. She could not respect his eye, but his love and\\nhis complaisance were unexceptionable.\\nThe sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she was quite enough\\npleased with the first day\\'s sketch to wish to go on. There was no want\\nof likeness, she had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she meant\\nto throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more\\nheight, and considerably more elegance, she had great confidence of its\\nbeing in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its\\ndestined place with credit to them both—a standing memorial of the\\nbeauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with\\nas many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton\\'s very promising\\nattachment was likely to add.',\n",

A woman is not to marry a man merely because she is asked, or\\nbecause he is attached to her, and can write a tolerable letter.\"\\n\"Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too.\"\\nEmma felt the bad taste of her friend, but let it pass with a \"very\\ntrue; and it would be a small consolation to her, for the clownish\\nmanner which might be offending her every hour of the day, to know that\\nher husband could write a good letter.\"\\n\"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always\\nhappy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him.\\nBut how shall I do? What shall I say?\"\\nEmma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer, and\\nadvised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of\\nher assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any\\nassistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every\\nsentence. The looking over his letter again, in replying to it, had\\nsuch a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace\\nher up with a few decisive expressions; and she was so very much\\nconcerned at the idea of making him unhappy, and thought so much of\\nwhat his mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious\\nthat they should not fancy her ungrateful, that Emma believed if the\\nyoung man had come in her way at that moment, he would have been\\naccepted after all.\\nThis letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business\\nwas finished, and Harriet safe. She was rather low all the evening, but\\nEmma could allow for her amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them\\nby speaking of her own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the\\nidea of Mr. Elton.\\n\"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,\" was said in rather a\\nsorrowful tone.\\n\"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You\\nare a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to\\nAbbey-Mill.\"\\n\"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy\\nbut at Hartfield.\"\\nSome time afterwards it was, \"I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much\\nsurprized if she knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for\\nMiss Nash thinks her own sister very well married, and it is only a\\nlinen-draper.\"\\n\"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher\\nof a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an\\nopportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear\\nvaluable in her eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she\\nis quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be\\namong the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are\\nthe only people to whom his looks and manners have explained\\nthemselves.\"\\nHarriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that\\npeople should like her so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly\\ncheering; but still, after a time, she was tender-hearted again towards\\nthe rejected Mr. Martin.\\n\"Now he has got my letter,\" said she softly. \"I wonder what they are\\nall doing—whether his sisters know—if he is unhappy, they will be\\nunhappy too. I hope he will not mind it so very much.\"\\n\"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully\\nemployed,\" cried Emma. \"At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing\\nyour picture to his mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful\\nis the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,\\nallowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.\"\\n\"My picture!—But he has left my picture in Bond-street.\"\\n\"Has he so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest\\nHarriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till\\njust before he mounts his horse to-morrow. It is his companion all this\\nevening, his solace, his delight. It opens his designs to his family,\\nit introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those\\npleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm\\nprepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy\\ntheir imaginations all are!\"\\nHarriet smiled again, and her smiles grew stronger.',\n",

He came to ask me whether I\\nthought it would be imprudent in him to settle so early; whether I\\nthought her too young: in short, whether I approved his choice\\naltogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her being considered\\n(especially since _your_ making so much of her) as in a line of society\\nabove him. I was very much pleased with all that he said. I never hear\\nbetter sense from any one than Robert Martin. He always speaks to the\\npurpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He told me every\\nthing; his circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in\\nthe event of his marriage. He is an excellent young man, both as son\\nand brother. I had no hesitation in advising him to marry. He proved to\\nme that he could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he\\ncould not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent\\nhim away very happy. If he had never esteemed my opinion before, he\\nwould have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house\\nthinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had.

       "   'text': 'her side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there\\nwould be a general cry-out upon her extreme good luck. Even _your_\\nsatisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you\\nwould not regret your friend\\'s leaving Highbury, for the sake of her\\nbeing settled so well. I remember saying to myself, \\'Even Emma, with\\nall her partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.\\'\"\\n\"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say\\nany such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his sense and all\\nhis merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate\\nfriend! Not regret her leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man\\nwhom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you\\nshould think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you\\nmine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair.\\nYou are not just to Harriet\\'s claims. They would be estimated very\\ndifferently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest\\nof the two, but he is undoubtedly her inferior as to rank in\\nsociety.—The sphere in which she moves is much above his.—It would be a\\ndegradation.\"\\n\"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a\\nrespectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!\"\\n\"As to the circumstances of her birth, though in a legal sense she may\\nbe called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She is not to pay\\nfor the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with\\nwhom she is brought up.—There can scarcely be a doubt that her father\\nis a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—Her allowance is very\\nliberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or\\ncomfort.—That she is a gentleman\\'s daughter, is indubitable to me; that\\nshe associates with gentlemen\\'s daughters, no one, I apprehend, will\\ndeny.—She is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.\"\\n\"Whoever might be her parents,\" said Mr. Knightley, \"whoever may have\\nhad the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of\\ntheir plan to introduce her into what you would call good society.\\nAfter receiving a very indifferent education she is left in Mrs.\\nGoddard\\'s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in Mrs.\\nGoddard\\'s line, to have Mrs. Goddard\\'s acquaintance. Her friends\\nevidently thought this good enough for her; and it _was_ good enough.\\nShe desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her into a\\nfriend, her mind had no distaste for her own set, nor any ambition\\nbeyond it. She was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer.\\nShe had no sense of superiority then. If she has it now, you have given\\nit. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would\\nnever have proceeded so far, if he had not felt persuaded of her not\\nbeing disinclined to him. I know him well. He has too much real feeling\\nto address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to\\nconceit, he is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it\\nhe had encouragement.\"\\nIt was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this\\nassertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject\\nagain.\\n\"You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are\\nunjust to Harriet. Harriet\\'s claims to marry well are not so\\ncontemptible as you represent them. She is not a clever girl, but she\\nhas better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have\\nher understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point,\\nhowever, and supposing her to be, as you describe her, only pretty and\\ngood-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she possesses them,\\nthey are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she\\nis, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine\\npeople out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more\\nphilosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed;\\ntill they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome\\nfaces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of\\nbeing admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from\\namong many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her good-nature, too, is\\nnot so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough\\nsweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a\\ngreat readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much\\nmistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such\\ntemper, the highest claims a woman could possess.\"',\n",

She\\ndid not repent what she had done; she still thought herself a better\\njudge of such a point of female right and refinement than he could be;\\nbut yet she had a sort of habitual respect for his judgment in general,\\nwhich made her dislike having it so loudly against her; and to have him\\nsitting just opposite to her in angry state, was very disagreeable.\\nSome minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt\\non Emma\\'s side to talk of the weather, but he made no answer. He was\\nthinking. The result of his thoughts appeared at last in these words.\\n\"Robert Martin has no great loss—if he can but think so; and I hope it\\nwill not be long before he does. Your views for Harriet are best known\\nto yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it\\nis fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have;—and as\\na friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it\\nwill be all labour in vain.\"\\nEmma laughed and disclaimed. He continued,\\n\"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man,\\nand a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make\\nan imprudent match. He knows the value of a good income as well as any\\nbody. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he will act rationally. He is\\nas well acquainted with his own claims, as you can be with Harriet\\'s.\\nHe knows that he is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite\\nwherever he goes; and from his general way of talking in unreserved\\nmoments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he does\\nnot mean to throw himself away. I have heard him speak with great\\nanimation of a large family of young ladies that his sisters are\\nintimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.\"\\n\"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Emma, laughing again. \"If I had\\nset my heart on Mr. Elton\\'s marrying Harriet, it would have been very\\nkind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to\\nmyself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to\\nequal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well.\"\\n\"Good morning to you,\"—said he, rising and walking off abruptly. He was\\nvery much vexed. He felt the disappointment of the young man, and was\\nmortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he\\nhad given; and the part which he was persuaded Emma had taken in the\\naffair, was provoking him exceedingly.\\nEmma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more\\nindistinctness in the causes of her\\'s, than in his. She did not always\\nfeel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that\\nher opinions were right and her adversary\\'s wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He\\nwalked off in more complete self-approbation than he left for her. She\\nwas not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and\\nthe return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet\\'s\\nstaying away so long was beginning to make her uneasy. The possibility\\nof the young man\\'s coming to Mrs. Goddard\\'s that morning, and meeting\\nwith Harriet and pleading his own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread\\nof such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when\\nHarriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such\\nreason to give for her long absence, she felt a satisfaction which\\nsettled her with her own mind, and convinced her, that let Mr.\\nKnightley think or say what he would, she had done nothing which\\nwoman\\'s friendship and woman\\'s feelings would not justify.\\nHe had frightened her a little about Mr. Elton; but when she considered\\nthat Mr. Knightley could not have observed him as she had done, neither\\nwith the interest, nor (she must be allowed to tell herself, in spite\\nof Mr. Knightley\\'s pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on\\nsuch a question as herself, that he had spoken it hastily and in anger,\\nshe was able to believe, that he had rather said what he wished\\nresentfully to be true, than what he knew any thing about. He certainly\\nmight have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she had ever\\ndone, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate\\ndisposition as to money matters; he might naturally be rather attentive\\nthan otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due\\nallowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all\\ninterested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course\\nthought nothing of its effects; but she saw too much of it to feel a\\ndoubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence\\nmight originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree\\nof prudence, she was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.\\nHarriet\\'s cheerful look and manner established hers: she came back, not\\nto think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been\\ntelling her something, which she repeated immediately with great\\ndelight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard\\'s to attend a sick child,\\nand Miss Nash had seen him, and he had told Miss Nash, that as he was\\ncoming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he had met Mr. Elton, and\\nfound to his great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his road to\\nLondon, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the\\nwhist-club night, which he had been never known to miss before; and Mr.\\nPerry had remonstrated with him about it, and told him how shabby it\\nwas in him, their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much\\nto persuade him to put off his journey only one day; but it would not\\ndo; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a _very_\\n_particular_ way indeed, that he was going on business which he would\\nnot put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very\\nenviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly\\nprecious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him, but he was very\\nsure there must be a _lady_ in the case, and he told him so; and Mr.\\nElton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great\\nspirits. Miss Nash had told her all this, and had talked a great deal\\nmore about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her,\\n\"that she did not pretend to understand what his business might be, but\\nshe only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she should\\nthink the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton',\n",

       "   'text': '\"Yes, very true. How nicely you talk; I love to hear you. You\\nunderstand every thing. You and Mr. Elton are one as clever as the\\nother. This charade!—If I had studied a twelvemonth, I could never have\\nmade any thing like it.\"\\n\"I thought he meant to try his skill, by his manner of declining it\\nyesterday.\"\\n\"I do think it is, without exception, the best charade I ever read.\"\\n\"I never read one more to the purpose, certainly.\"\\n\"It is as long again as almost all we have had before.\"\\n\"I do not consider its length as particularly in its favour. Such\\nthings in general cannot be too short.\"\\nHarriet was too intent on the lines to hear. The most satisfactory\\ncomparisons were rising in her mind.\\n\"It is one thing,\" said she, presently—her cheeks in a glow—\"to have\\nvery good sense in a common way, like every body else, and if there is\\nany thing to say, to sit down and write a letter, and say just what you\\nmust, in a short way; and another, to write verses and charades like\\nthis.\"\\nEmma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr. Martin\\'s\\nprose.\\n\"Such sweet lines!\" continued Harriet—\"these two last!—But how shall I\\never be able to return the paper, or say I have found it out?—Oh! Miss\\nWoodhouse, what can we do about that?\"\\n\"Leave it to me. You do nothing. He will be here this evening, I dare\\nsay, and then I will give it him back, and some nonsense or other will\\npass between us, and you shall not be committed.—Your soft eyes shall\\nchuse their own time for beaming. Trust to me.\"\\n\"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what a pity that I must not write this beautiful\\ncharade into my book! I am sure I have not got one half so good.\"\\n\"Leave out the two last lines, and there is no reason why you should\\nnot write it into your book.\"\\n\"Oh! but those two lines are\"—\\n—\"The best of all. Granted;—for private enjoyment; and for private\\nenjoyment keep them. They are not at all the less written you know,\\nbecause you divide them. The couplet does not cease to be, nor does its\\nmeaning change. But take it away, and all _appropriation_ ceases, and a\\nvery pretty gallant charade remains, fit for any collection. Depend\\nupon it, he would not like to have his charade slighted, much better\\nthan his passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities,\\nor neither. Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can\\nbe no possible reflection on you.\"\\nHarriet submitted, though her mind could hardly separate the parts, so\\nas to feel quite sure that her friend were not writing down a\\ndeclaration of love. It seemed too precious an offering for any degree\\nof publicity.\\n\"I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,\" said she.\\n\"Very well,\" replied Emma; \"a most natural feeling; and the longer it\\nlasts, the better I shall be pleased. But here is my father coming: you\\nwill not object to my reading the charade to him. It will be giving him\\nso much pleasure! He loves any thing of the sort, and especially any\\nthing that pays woman a compliment. He has the tenderest spirit of\\ngallantry towards us all!—You must let me read it to him.\"\\nHarriet looked grave.\\n\"My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.—You\\nwill betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too\\nquick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning\\nwhich may be affixed to it. Do not be overpowered by such a little\\ntribute of admiration. If he had been anxious for secrecy, he would not\\nhave left the paper while I was by; but he rather pushed it towards me\\nthan towards you. Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He has\\nencouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over\\nthis charade.\"\\n\"Oh! no—I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please.\"\\nMr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the\\nrecurrence of his very frequent inquiry of \"Well, my dears, how does\\nyour book go on?—Have you got any thing fresh?\"\\n\"Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. A\\npiece of paper was found on the table this morning—(dropt, we suppose,\\nby a fairy)—containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied\\nit in.\"\\nShe read it to him, just as he liked to have any thing read, slowly and\\ndistinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every\\npart as she proceeded—and he was very much pleased, and, as she had\\nforeseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.\\n\"Aye, that\\'s very just, indeed, that\\'s very properly said. Very true.\\n\\'Woman, lovely woman.\\' It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can\\neasily guess what fairy brought it.—Nobody could have written so\\nprettily, but you, Emma.\"\\nEmma only nodded, and smiled.—After a little thinking, and a very\\ntender sigh, he added,\\n\"Ah! it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother\\nwas so clever at all those things! If I had but her memory! But I can\\nremember nothing;—not even that particular riddle which you have heard\\nme mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are\\nseveral.\\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid,\\nKindled a flame I yet deplore,\\nThe hood-wink\\'d boy I called to aid,\\nThough of his near approach afraid,\\nSo fatal to my suit before.\\nAnd that is all that I can recollect of it—but it is very clever all\\nthe way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.\"\\n\"Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the\\nElegant Extracts. It was Garrick\\'s, you know.\"\\n\"Aye, very true.—I wish I could recollect more of it.\\nKitty, a fair but frozen maid.\\nThe name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she was very near being\\nchristened Catherine after her grandmama. I hope we shall have her here\\nnext week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her—and what\\nroom there will be for the children?\"\\n\"Oh! yes—she will have her own room, of course; the room she always\\nhas;—and there is the nursery for the children,—just as usual, you\\nknow. Why should there be any change?\"\\n\"I do not know, my dear—but it is so long since she was here!—not since\\nlast Easter, and then only for a few days.—Mr. John Knightley\\'s being a\\nlawyer is very inconvenient.—Poor Isabella!—she is sadly taken away\\nfrom us all!—and how sorry she will be when she comes, not to see Miss\\nTaylor here!\"\\n\"She will not be surprized, papa, at least.\"\\n\"I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I\\nfirst heard she was going to be married.\"\\n\"We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is\\nhere.\"\\n\"Yes, my dear, if there is time.—But—(in a very depressed tone)—she is\\ncoming for only one week. There will not be time for any thing.\"\\n\"It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer—but it seems a case of\\nnecessity. Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we\\nought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time\\nthey can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be\\ntaken out for the Abbey. Mr. Knightley promises to give up his claim',\n",

       "   'text': 'this Christmas—though you know it is longer since they were with him,\\nthan with us.\"\\n\"It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be\\nanywhere but at Hartfield.\"\\nMr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley\\'s claims on his\\nbrother, or any body\\'s claims on Isabella, except his own. He sat\\nmusing a little while, and then said,\\n\"But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so\\nsoon, though he does. I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her to\\nstay longer with us. She and the children might stay very well.\"\\n\"Ah! papa—that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do\\nnot think you ever will. Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her\\nhusband.\"\\nThis was too true for contradiction. Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse\\ncould only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his spirits affected\\nby the idea of his daughter\\'s attachment to her husband, she\\nimmediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.\\n\"Harriet must give us as much of her company as she can while my\\nbrother and sister are here. I am sure she will be pleased with the\\nchildren. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa? I wonder\\nwhich she will think the handsomest, Henry or John?\"\\n\"Aye, I wonder which she will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be\\nto come. They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.\"\\n\"I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.\"\\n\"Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his mama. Henry is the\\neldest, he was named after me, not after his father. John, the second,\\nis named after his father. Some people are surprized, I believe, that\\nthe eldest was not, but Isabella would have him called Henry, which I\\nthought very pretty of her. And he is a very clever boy, indeed. They\\nare all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways. They will\\ncome and stand by my chair, and say, \\'Grandpapa, can you give me a bit\\nof string?\\' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him knives\\nwere only made for grandpapas. I think their father is too rough with\\nthem very often.\"\\n\"He appears rough to you,\" said Emma, \"because you are so very gentle\\nyourself; but if you could compare him with other papas, you would not\\nthink him rough. He wishes his boys to be active and hardy; and if they\\nmisbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he is an\\naffectionate father—certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate\\nfather. The children are all fond of him.\"\\n\"And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a\\nvery frightful way!\"\\n\"But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much. It is such\\nenjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of\\ntheir taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.\"\\n\"Well, I cannot understand it.\"\\n\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot\\nunderstand the pleasures of the other.\"\\nLater in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in\\npreparation for the regular four o\\'clock dinner, the hero of this\\ninimitable charade walked in again. Harriet turned away; but Emma could\\nreceive him with the usual smile, and her quick eye soon discerned in\\nhis the consciousness of having made a push—of having thrown a die; and\\nshe imagined he was come to see how it might turn up. His ostensible\\nreason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse\\'s party could be made\\nup in the evening without him, or whether he should be in the smallest\\ndegree necessary at Hartfield. If he were, every thing else must give\\nway; but otherwise his friend Cole had been saying so much about his\\ndining with him—had made such a point of it, that he had promised him\\nconditionally to come.\\nEmma thanked him, but could not allow of his disappointing his friend\\non their account; her father was sure of his rubber. He re-urged—she\\nre-declined; and he seemed then about to make his bow, when taking the\\npaper from the table, she returned it—\\n\"Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us;\\nthank you for the sight of it. We admired it so much, that I have\\nventured to write it into Miss Smith\\'s collection. Your friend will not\\ntake it amiss I hope. Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first\\neight lines.\"\\nMr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say. He looked\\nrather doubtingly—rather confused; said something about\\n\"honour,\"—glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open\\non the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively. With the\\nview of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said,\\n\"You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must\\nnot be confined to one or two. He may be sure of every woman\\'s\\napprobation while he writes with such gallantry.\"\\n\"I have no hesitation in saying,\" replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating\\na good deal while he spoke; \"I have no hesitation in saying—at least if\\nmy friend feels at all as _I_ do—I have not the smallest doubt that,\\ncould he see his little effusion honoured as _I_ see it, (looking at\\nthe book again, and replacing it on the table), he would consider it as\\nthe proudest moment of his life.\"\\nAfter this speech he was gone as soon as possible. Emma could not think\\nit too soon; for with all his good and agreeable qualities, there was a\\nsort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to\\nlaugh. She ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and\\nthe sublime of pleasure to Harriet\\'s share.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to\\nprevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the\\nmorrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who\\nlived a little way out of Highbury.\\nTheir road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane\\nleading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street\\nof the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of\\nMr. Elton. A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then,\\nabout a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and\\nnot very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be. It had\\nno advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the\\npresent proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility\\nof the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing\\neyes.—Emma\\'s remark was—\\n\"There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these\\ndays.\"—Harriet\\'s was—\\n\"Oh, what a sweet house!—How very beautiful!—There are the yellow\\ncurtains that Miss Nash admires so much.\"\\n\"I do not often walk this way _now_,\" said Emma, as they proceeded,\\n\"but _then_ there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get\\nintimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of\\nthis part of Highbury.\"\\nHarriet, she found, had never in her life been inside the Vicarage, and\\nher curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and\\nprobabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr.\\nElton\\'s seeing ready wit in her.\\n\"I wish we could contrive it,\" said she; \"but I cannot think of any\\ntolerable pretence for going in;—no servant that I want to inquire\\nabout of his housekeeper—no message from my father.\"\\nShe pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of\\nsome minutes, Harriet thus began again—\\n\"I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or\\ngoing to be married! so charming as you are!\"—\\nEmma laughed, and replied,\\n\"My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry;\\nI must find other people charming—one other person at least. And I am\\nnot only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little\\nintention of ever marrying at all.\"\\n\"Ah!—so you say; but I cannot believe it.\"\\n\"I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be\\ntempted; Mr. Elton, you know, (recollecting herself,) is out of the\\nquestion: and I do _not_ wish to see any such person. I would rather\\nnot be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to\\nmarry, I must expect to repent it.\"\\n\"Dear me!—it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!\"—\\n\"I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry. Were I to fall\\nin love, indeed, it would be a different thing! but I never have been\\nin love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever\\nshall. And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a\\nsituation as mine. Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want;\\nconsequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much\\nmistress of their husband\\'s house as I am of Hartfield; and never,\\nnever could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always\\nfirst and always right in any man\\'s eyes as I am in my father\\'s.\"\\n\"But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!\"\\n\"That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I\\nthought I should ever be like Miss Bates! so silly—so satisfied—so\\nsmiling—so prosing—so undistinguishing and unfastidious—and so apt to\\ntell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry\\nto-morrow. But between _us_, I am convinced there never can be any\\nlikeness, except in being unmarried.\"\\n\"But still, you will be an old maid! and that\\'s so dreadful!\"\\n\"Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty\\nonly which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public! A single\\nwoman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable\\nold maid! the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of\\ngood fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and\\npleasant as any body else. And the distinction is not quite so much\\nagainst the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first;\\nfor a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour\\nthe temper. Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very\\nsmall, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and\\ncross. This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she is only too\\ngood natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she is very\\nmuch to the taste of every body, though single and though poor. Poverty\\ncertainly has not contracted her mind: I really believe, if she had\\nonly a shilling in the world, she would be very likely to give away\\nsixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her: that is a great charm.\"\\n\"Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you\\ngrow old?\"\\n\"If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great\\nmany independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more\\nin want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty. Woman\\'s\\nusual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they\\nare now; or with no important variation. If I draw less, I shall read\\nmore; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work. And as for\\nobjects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the\\ngreat point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil\\nto be avoided in _not_ marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the\\nchildren of a sister I love so much, to care about. There will be\\nenough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation\\nthat declining life can need. There will be enough for every hope and\\nevery fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a\\nparent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and\\nblinder. My nephews and nieces!—I shall often have a niece with me.\"\\n\"Do you know Miss Bates\\'s niece? That is, I know you must have seen her\\na hundred times—but are you acquainted?\"\\n\"Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she comes to\\nHighbury. By the bye, _that_ is almost enough to put one out of conceit\\nwith a niece. Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people\\nhalf so much about all the Knightleys together, as she does about Jane\\nFairfax. One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. Every letter\\nfrom her is read forty times over; her compliments to all friends go\\nround and round again; and if she does but send her aunt the pattern of\\na stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her grandmother, one hears\\nof nothing else for a month. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she\\ntires me to death.\"\\nThey were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were\\nsuperseded. Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor\\nwere as sure of relief from her personal attention and kindness, her\\ncounsel and her patience, as from her purse. She understood their ways,\\ncould allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic\\nexpectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had\\ndone so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and\\nalways gave her assistance with as much intelligence as good-will. In\\nthe present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she\\ncame to visit; and after remaining there as long as she could give\\ncomfort or advice, she quitted the cottage with such an impression of\\nthe scene as made her say to Harriet, as they walked away,\\n\"These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good. How trifling they make\\nevery thing else appear!—I feel now as if I could think of nothing but\\nthese poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how\\nsoon it may all vanish from my mind?\"\\n\"Very true,\" said Harriet. \"Poor creatures! one can think of nothing\\nelse.\"\\n\"And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,\" said\\nEmma, as she crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended\\nthe narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them\\ninto the lane again. \"I do not think it will,\" stopping to look once\\nmore at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still\\ngreater within.\\n\"Oh! dear, no,\" said her companion.\\nThey walked on. The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was\\npassed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma\\ntime only to say farther,\\n\"Ah! Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good\\nthoughts. Well, (smiling,) I hope it may be allowed that if compassion\\nhas produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that\\nis truly important. If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we\\ncan for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to\\nourselves.\"',\n",

He had been going to call on them. His visit\\nhe would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what\\ncould be done and should be done. Mr. Elton then turned back to\\naccompany them.\\n\"To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,\" thought Emma;\\n\"to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of\\nlove on each side. I should not wonder if it were to bring on the\\ndeclaration. It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else.\"\\nAnxious to separate herself from them as far as she could, she soon\\nafterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one\\nside of the lane, leaving them together in the main road. But she had\\nnot been there two minutes when she found that Harriet\\'s habits of\\ndependence and imitation were bringing her up too, and that, in short,\\nthey would both be soon after her. This would not do; she immediately\\nstopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing\\nof her half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the\\nfootpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she would\\nfollow in half a minute. They did as they were desired; and by the time\\nshe judged it reasonable to have done with her boot, she had the\\ncomfort of farther delay in her power, being overtaken by a child from\\nthe cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her pitcher, to\\nfetch broth from Hartfield. To walk by the side of this child, and talk\\nto and question her, was the most natural thing in the world, or would\\nhave been the most natural, had she been acting just then without\\ndesign; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead,\\nwithout any obligation of waiting for her. She gained on them, however,\\ninvoluntarily: the child\\'s pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and\\nshe was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a\\nconversation which interested them. Mr. Elton was speaking with\\nanimation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma,\\nhaving sent the child on, was beginning to think how she might draw\\nback a little more, when they both looked around, and she was obliged\\nto join them.\\nMr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail;\\nand Emma experienced some disappointment when she found that he was\\nonly giving his fair companion an account of the yesterday\\'s party at\\nhis friend Cole\\'s, and that she was come in herself for the Stilton\\ncheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and\\nall the dessert.\\n\"This would soon have led to something better, of course,\" was her\\nconsoling reflection; \"any thing interests between those who love; and\\nany thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart. If I\\ncould but have kept longer away!\"\\nThey now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage\\npales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the\\nhouse, made her again find something very much amiss about her boot,\\nand fall behind to arrange it once more. She then broke the lace off\\nshort, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged\\nto entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her inability to put herself\\nto rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.\\n\"Part of my lace is gone,\" said she, \"and I do not know how I am to\\ncontrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I\\nhope I am not often so ill-equipped. Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to\\nstop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or\\nstring, or any thing just to keep my boot on.\"\\nMr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could\\nexceed his alertness and attention in conducting them into his house\\nand endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage. The room they\\nwere taken into was the one he chiefly occupied, and looking forwards;\\nbehind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door\\nbetween them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to\\nreceive her assistance in the most comfortable manner. She was obliged\\nto leave the door ajar as she found it; but she fully intended that Mr.\\nElton should close it. It was not closed, however, it still remained\\najar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she\\nhoped to make it practicable for him to chuse his own subject in the\\nadjoining room. For ten minutes she could hear nothing but herself. It\\ncould be protracted no longer. She was then obliged to be finished, and\\nmake her appearance.\\nThe lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most\\nfavourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of\\nhaving schemed successfully. But it would not do; he had not come to\\nthe point. He had been most agreeable, most delightful; he had told\\nHarriet that he had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them;\\nother little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing\\nserious.\\n\"Cautious, very cautious,\" thought Emma; \"he advances inch by inch, and\\nwill hazard nothing till he believes himself secure.\"\\nStill, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her\\ningenious device, she could not but flatter herself that it had been\\nthe occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading\\nthem forward to the great event.',\n",

Her wish of shewing you attention could not\\nbe doubted, and his being a disengaged and social man makes it all\\neasy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of\\nthe change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and\\nnow you have Emma\\'s account, I hope you will be satisfied.\"\\n\"Why, to be sure,\" said Mr. Woodhouse—\"yes, certainly—I cannot deny\\nthat Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty\\noften—but then—she is always obliged to go away again.\"\\n\"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she did not, papa.—You quite\\nforget poor Mr. Weston.\"\\n\"I think, indeed,\" said John Knightley pleasantly, \"that Mr. Weston has\\nsome little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of\\nthe poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the\\nclaims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for\\nIsabella, she has been married long enough to see the convenience of\\nputting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she can.\"\\n\"Me, my love,\" cried his wife, hearing and understanding only in part.—\\n\"Are you talking about me?—I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a\\ngreater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for\\nthe misery of her leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of\\nMiss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to\\nslighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is\\nnothing he does not deserve. I believe he is one of the very\\nbest-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your\\nbrother, I do not know his equal for temper. I shall never forget his\\nflying Henry\\'s kite for him that very windy day last Easter—and ever\\nsince his particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing\\nthat note, at twelve o\\'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that\\nthere was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could\\nnot be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.—If any body\\ncan deserve him, it must be Miss Taylor.\"\\n\"Where is the young man?\" said John Knightley. \"Has he been here on\\nthis occasion—or has he not?\"\\n\"He has not been here yet,\" replied Emma. \"There was a strong\\nexpectation of his coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in\\nnothing; and I have not heard him mentioned lately.\"\\n\"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,\" said her father. \"He\\nwrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her, and a very\\nproper, handsome letter it was. She shewed it to me. I thought it very\\nwell done of him indeed. Whether it was his own idea you know, one\\ncannot tell. He is but young, and his uncle, perhaps—\"\\n\"My dear papa, he is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.\"\\n\"Three-and-twenty!—is he indeed?—Well, I could not have thought it—and\\nhe was but two years old when he lost his poor mother! Well, time does\\nfly indeed!—and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding\\ngood, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of\\npleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept.\\n28th—and began, \\'My dear Madam,\\' but I forget how it went on; and it\\nwas signed \\'F. C. Weston Churchill.\\'—I remember that perfectly.\"\\n\"How very pleasing and proper of him!\" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John\\nKnightley. \"I have no doubt of his being a most amiable young man. But\\nhow sad it is that he should not live at home with his father! There is\\nsomething so shocking in a child\\'s being taken away from his parents\\nand natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part\\nwith him. To give up one\\'s child! I really never could think well of\\nany body who proposed such a thing to any body else.\"\\n\"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,\" observed Mr.\\nJohn Knightley coolly. \"But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have\\nfelt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is\\nrather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings;\\nhe takes things as he finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow\\nor other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society\\nfor his comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and\\nplaying whist with his neighbours five times a week, than upon family\\naffection, or any thing that home affords.\"',\n",

As a magistrate, he had\\ngenerally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some\\ncurious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the\\nhome-farm at Donwell, he had to tell what every field was to bear next\\nyear, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being\\ninteresting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest\\npart of his life, and whose attachments were strong. The plan of a\\ndrain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the\\ndestination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was\\nentered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his cooler\\nmanners rendered possible; and if his willing brother ever left him any\\nthing to inquire about, his inquiries even approached a tone of\\neagerness.\\nWhile they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a\\nfull flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his daughter.\\n\"My poor dear Isabella,\" said he, fondly taking her hand, and\\ninterrupting, for a few moments, her busy labours for some one of her\\nfive children—\"How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!\\nAnd how tired you must be after your journey!

And, my dear, whenever he comes,\\nyou had better let him look at little Bella\\'s throat.\"\\n\"Oh! my dear sir, her throat is so much better that I have hardly any\\nuneasiness about it. Either bathing has been of the greatest service to\\nher, or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr.\\nWingfield\\'s, which we have been applying at times ever since August.\"\\n\"It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use\\nto her—and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have\\nspoken to—\\n\"You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,\" said Emma, \"I\\nhave not heard one inquiry after them.\"\\n\"Oh! the good Bateses—I am quite ashamed of myself—but you mention them\\nin most of your letters.

But poor Mrs. Bates had a\\nbad cold about a month ago.\"\\n\"How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been\\nthis autumn. Mr. Wingfield told me that he has never known them more\\ngeneral or heavy—except when it has been quite an influenza.\"\\n\"That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you\\nmention.

Our part of London is\\nvery superior to most others!—You must not confound us with London in\\ngeneral, my dear sir. The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very\\ndifferent from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! I should be\\nunwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;—there is\\nhardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but\\n_we_ are so remarkably airy!—Mr. Wingfield thinks the vicinity of\\nBrunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.\"\\n\"Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. You make the best of it—but\\nafter you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different\\ncreatures; you do not look like the same. Now I cannot say, that I\\nthink you are any of you looking well at present.\"\\n\"I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those\\nlittle nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely\\nfree from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were\\nrather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a\\nlittle more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of\\ncoming. I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I\\nassure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he did not believe he had ever\\nsent us off altogether, in such good case. I trust, at least, that you\\ndo not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,\" turning her eyes with\\naffectionate anxiety towards her husband.\\n\"Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley\\nvery far from looking well.\"\\n\"What is the matter, sir?—Did you speak to me?\" cried Mr. John\\nKnightley, hearing his own name.\\n\"I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking\\nwell—but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued. I could have\\nwished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before\\nyou left home.\"\\n\"My dear Isabella,\"—exclaimed he hastily—\"pray do not concern yourself\\nabout my looks. Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and\\nthe children, and let me look as I chuse.\"\\n\"I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,\"\\ncried Emma, \"about your friend Mr. Graham\\'s intending to have a bailiff\\nfrom Scotland, to look after his new estate. What will it answer? Will\\nnot the old prejudice be too strong?\"\\nAnd she talked in this way so long and successfully that, when forced\\nto give her attention again to her father and sister, she had nothing\\nworse to hear than Isabella\\'s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane\\nFairfax, though no great favourite with her in general, she was at that\\nmoment very happy to assist in praising.\\n\"That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!\" said Mrs. John Knightley.—\"It is so\\nlong since I have seen her, except now and then for a moment\\naccidentally in town! What happiness it must be to her good old\\ngrandmother and excellent aunt, when she comes to visit them! I always\\nregret excessively on dear Emma\\'s account that she cannot be more at\\nHighbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs.\\nCampbell will not be able to part with her at all. She would be such a\\ndelightful companion for Emma.\"\\nMr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added,\\n\"Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty\\nkind of young person. You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a\\nbetter companion than Harriet.\"\\n\"I am most happy to hear it—but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so\\nvery accomplished and superior!—and exactly Emma\\'s age.\"\\nThis topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar\\nmoment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not\\nclose without a little return of agitation. The gruel came and supplied\\na great deal to be said—much praise and many comments—undoubting\\ndecision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe\\nPhilippics upon the many houses where it was never met with\\ntolerably;—but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter\\nhad to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in\\nher own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never\\nhad been able to understand what she meant by a basin of nice smooth\\ngruel, thin, but not too thin. Often as she had wished for and ordered\\nit, she had never been able to get any thing tolerable. Here was a\\ndangerous opening.\\n\"Ah!\" said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his head and fixing his eyes on her\\nwith tender concern.—The ejaculation in Emma\\'s ear expressed, \"Ah!\\nthere is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It\\ndoes not bear talking of.\" And for a little while she hoped he would\\nnot talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore\\nhim to the relish of his own smooth gruel. After an interval of some\\nminutes, however, he began with,\\n\"I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn,\\ninstead of coming here.\"\\n\"But why should you be sorry, sir?—I assure you, it did the children a\\ngreat deal of good.\"\\n\"And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been\\nto South End. South End is an unhealthy place. Perry was surprized to\\nhear you had fixed upon South End.\"\\n\"I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite\\na mistake, sir.—We all had our health perfectly well there, never found\\nthe least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is\\nentirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he may\\nbe depended on, for he thoroughly understands the nature of the air,\\nand his own brother and family have been there repeatedly.\"\\n\"You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, if you went anywhere.—Perry\\nwas a week at Cromer once, and he holds it to be the best of all the\\nsea-bathing places. A fine open sea, he says, and very pure air. And,\\nby what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from\\nthe sea—a quarter of a mile off—very comfortable. You should have\\nconsulted Perry.\"\\n\"But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;—only consider how\\ngreat it would have been.—An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.\"\\n\"Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else\\nshould be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to\\nchuse between forty miles and an hundred.—Better not move at all,\\nbetter stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a\\nworse air. This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him a very\\nill-judged measure.\"\\nEmma\\'s attempts to stop her father had been vain; and when he had\\nreached such a point as this, she could not wonder at her\\nbrother-in-law\\'s breaking out.\\n\"Mr. Perry,\" said he, in a voice of very strong displeasure, \"would do\\nas well to keep his opinion till it is asked for. Why does he make it\\nany business of his, to wonder at what I do?—at my taking my family to\\none part of the coast or another?—I may be allowed, I hope, the use of\\nmy judgment as well as Mr. Perry.—I want his directions no more than\\nhis drugs.\" He paused—and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only\\nsarcastic dryness, \"If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and\\nfive children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater\\nexpense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as\\nwilling to prefer Cromer to South End as he could himself.\"\\n\"True, true,\" cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition—\"very\\ntrue. That\\'s a consideration indeed.—But John, as to what I was telling\\nyou of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the\\nright that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive\\nany difficulty. I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of\\ninconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly\\nthe present line of the path.... The only way of proving it, however,\\nwill be to turn to our maps. I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow\\nmorning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me\\nyour opinion.\"\\nMr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his\\nfriend Perry, to whom he had, in fact, though unconsciously, been\\nattributing many of his own feelings and expressions;—but the soothing\\nattentions of his daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the\\nimmediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the\\nother, prevented any renewal of it.',\n",

They joined company and\\nproceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend\\'s\\ncomplaint;—\"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat\\nabout her, a quick, low pulse, &c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs.\\nGoddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often\\nalarmed her with them.\" Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as\\nhe exclaimed,\\n\"A sore-throat!—I hope not infectious.

It is downright labour to him where ladies are concerned. With\\nmen he can be rational and unaffected, but when he has ladies to\\nplease, every feature works.\"\\n\"Mr. Elton\\'s manners are not perfect,\" replied Emma; \"but where there\\nis a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a\\ngreat deal. Where a man does his best with only moderate powers, he\\nwill have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such\\nperfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but\\nvalue.\"\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, \"he seems\\nto have a great deal of good-will towards you.\"\\n\"Me!\" she replied with a smile of astonishment, \"are you imagining me\\nto be Mr. Elton\\'s object?\"\\n\"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never\\noccurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration\\nnow.\"\\n\"Mr. Elton in love with me!—What an idea!\"\\n\"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is\\nso or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your\\nmanners to him encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better\\nlook about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.\"\\n\"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I\\nare very good friends, and nothing more;\" and she walked on, amusing\\nherself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a\\npartial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of\\nhigh pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very\\nwell pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant, and\\nin want of counsel. He said no more.\\nMr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in\\nspite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of\\nshrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his\\neldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness\\nof the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his\\nown going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it\\nwas cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was\\nsevere; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes\\nof snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of\\nbeing so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very\\nwhite world in a very short time.\\nEmma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour. The\\npreparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of\\nhis children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least,\\nwhich Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he anticipated\\nnothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the\\nwhole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him in expressing his\\ndiscontent.\\n\"A man,\" said he, \"must have a very good opinion of himself when he\\nasks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as\\nthis, for the sake of coming to see him. He must think himself a most\\nagreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest\\nabsurdity—Actually snowing at this moment!—The folly of not allowing\\npeople to be comfortable at home—and the folly of people\\'s not staying\\ncomfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an\\nevening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we\\nshould deem it;—and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing\\nthan usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of\\nthe voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his view\\nor his feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter\\nthat he can;—here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in\\nanother man\\'s house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said\\nand heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.\\nGoing in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;—four horses and\\nfour servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering\\ncreatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had\\nat home.\"',\n",

She could not be complying, she dreaded being\\nquarrelsome; her heroism reached only to silence. She allowed him to\\ntalk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening\\nher lips.\\nThey arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr.\\nElton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma\\nthought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all\\nobligation and cheerfulness; he was so very cheerful in his civilities\\nindeed, that she began to think he must have received a different\\naccount of Harriet from what had reached her. She had sent while\\ndressing, and the answer had been, \"Much the same—not better.\"\\n\"_My_ report from Mrs. Goddard\\'s,\" said she presently, \"was not so\\npleasant as I had hoped—\\'Not better\\' was _my_ answer.\"\\nHis face lengthened immediately; and his voice was the voice of\\nsentiment as he answered.\\n\"Oh! no—I am grieved to find—I was on the point of telling you that\\nwhen I called at Mrs. Goddard\\'s door, which I did the very last thing\\nbefore I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better,\\nby no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned—I had\\nflattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew\\nhad been given her in the morning.\"\\nEmma smiled and answered—\"My visit was of use to the nervous part of\\nher complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it\\nis a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you\\nprobably heard.\"\\n\"Yes—I imagined—that is—I did not—\"\\n\"He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow\\nmorning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is\\nimpossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party\\nto-day!\"\\n\"Dreadful!—Exactly so, indeed.—She will be missed every moment.\"\\nThis was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really\\nestimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay\\nwhen only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things,\\nand in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.\\n\"What an excellent device,\" said he, \"the use of a sheepskin for\\ncarriages. How very comfortable they make it;—impossible to feel cold\\nwith such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have\\nrendered a gentleman\\'s carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced\\nand guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way\\nunpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very\\ncold afternoon—but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.—Ha!\\nsnows a little I see.\"\\n\"Yes,\" said John Knightley, \"and I think we shall have a good deal of\\nit.\"\\n\"Christmas weather,\" observed Mr. Elton. \"Quite seasonable; and\\nextremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin\\nyesterday, and prevent this day\\'s party, which it might very possibly\\nhave done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been\\nmuch snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite\\nthe season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body\\ninvites their friends about them, and people think little of even the\\nworst weather. I was snowed up at a friend\\'s house once for a week.\\nNothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not\\nget away till that very day se\\'nnight.\"\\nMr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but\\nsaid only, coolly,\\n\"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.\"',\n",

The introduction must be unpleasant,\\nwhenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.\"\\n\"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even\\nif this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that\\nsome excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine\\nany reluctance on his side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the\\nChurchills\\' to keep him to themselves. There is jealousy. They are\\njealous even of his regard for his father. In short, I can feel no\\ndependence on his coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine.\"\\n\"He ought to come,\" said Emma. \"If he could stay only a couple of days,\\nhe ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man\\'s not having\\nit in his power to do as much as that. A young _woman_, if she fall\\ninto bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she\\nwants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young _man_\\'s being under\\nsuch restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his father, if\\nhe likes it.\"\\n\"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before\\none decides upon what he can do,\" replied Mrs. Weston. \"One ought to\\nuse the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one\\nindividual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must\\nnot be judged by general rules: _she_ is so very unreasonable; and\\nevery thing gives way to her.\"\\n\"But she is so fond of the nephew: he is so very great a favourite.\\nNow, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural,\\nthat while she makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to\\nwhom she owes every thing, while she exercises incessant caprice\\ntowards _him_, she should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom\\nshe owes nothing at all.\"\\n\"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand\\na bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.\\nI have no doubt of his having, at times, considerable influence; but it\\nmay be perfectly impossible for him to know beforehand _when_ it will\\nbe.\"\\nEmma listened, and then coolly said, \"I shall not be satisfied, unless\\nhe comes.\"\\n\"He may have a great deal of influence on some points,\" continued Mrs.\\nWeston, \"and on others, very little: and among those, on which she is\\nbeyond his reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance',\n",

Mr. Weston was chatty\\nand convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at\\nlast the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in\\nvery good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and\\nEmma were sitting together on a sofa. He joined them immediately, and,\\nwith scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.\\nEmma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her mind by the\\nexpectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his late\\nimproprieties, and be as well satisfied with him as before, and on his\\nmaking Harriet his very first subject, was ready to listen with most\\nfriendly smiles.\\nHe professed himself extremely anxious about her fair friend—her fair,\\nlovely, amiable friend. \"Did she know?—had she heard any thing about\\nher, since their being at Randalls?—he felt much anxiety—he must\\nconfess that the nature of her complaint alarmed him considerably.\" And\\nin this style he talked on for some time very properly, not much\\nattending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the\\nterror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him.\\nBut at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if\\nhe were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account, than\\non Harriet\\'s—more anxious that she should escape the infection, than\\nthat there should be no infection in the complaint. He began with great\\nearnestness to entreat her to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber\\nagain, for the present—to entreat her to _promise_ _him_ not to venture\\ninto such hazard till he had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his opinion; and\\nthough she tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its\\nproper course, there was no putting an end to his extreme solicitude\\nabout her. She was vexed. It did appear—there was no concealing\\nit—exactly like the pretence of being in love with her, instead of\\nHarriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!\\nand she had difficulty in behaving with temper. He turned to Mrs.\\nWeston to implore her assistance, \"Would not she give him her\\nsupport?—would not she add her persuasions to his, to induce Miss\\nWoodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard\\'s till it were certain that Miss\\nSmith\\'s disorder had no infection? He could not be satisfied without a\\npromise—would not she give him her influence in procuring it?\"\\n\"So scrupulous for others,\" he continued, \"and yet so careless for\\nherself! She wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and\\nyet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore\\nthroat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?—Judge between us. Have not I\\nsome right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.\"\\nEmma saw Mrs. Weston\\'s surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an\\naddress which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right\\nof first interest in her; and as for herself, she was too much provoked\\nand offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the\\npurpose. She could only give him a look; but it was such a look as she\\nthought must restore him to his senses, and then left the sofa,\\nremoving to a seat by her sister, and giving her all her attention.\\nShe had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did\\nanother subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room\\nfrom examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information\\nof the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast,\\nwith a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr.\\nWoodhouse:\\n\"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir.\\nSomething new for your coachman and horses to be making their way\\nthrough a storm of snow.\"\\nPoor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else\\nhad something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized,\\nand had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and\\nEmma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his\\nson-in-law, who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly.\\n\"I admired your resolution very much, sir,\" said he, \"in venturing out',\n",

I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before\\nmidnight.\"\\nMr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he\\nhad known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it\\nshould make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his\\nhurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely\\nto fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he was afraid\\nthey would find no difficulty. He wished the road might be impassable,\\nthat he might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost\\ngood-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body,\\ncalling on his wife to agree with him, that with a little contrivance,\\nevery body might be lodged, which she hardly knew how to do, from the\\nconsciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.\\n\"What is to be done, my dear Emma?—what is to be done?\" was Mr.\\nWoodhouse\\'s first exclamation, and all that he could say for some time.\\nTo her he looked for comfort; and her assurances of safety, her\\nrepresentation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of\\ntheir having so many friends about them, revived him a little.\\nHis eldest daughter\\'s alarm was equal to his own. The horror of being\\nblocked up at Randalls, while her children were at Hartfield, was full\\nin her imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for\\nadventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she was\\neager to have it settled, that her father and Emma should remain at\\nRandalls, while she and her husband set forward instantly through all\\nthe possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.\\n\"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,\" said she; \"I\\ndare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if\\nwe do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at\\nall afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my\\nshoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing\\nthat gives me cold.\"\\n\"Indeed!\" replied he. \"Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most\\nextraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing\\ndoes give you cold. Walk home!—you are prettily shod for walking home,\\nI dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses.\"\\nIsabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her approbation of the plan. Mrs.\\nWeston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could\\nnot so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away;\\nand they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had\\nleft the room immediately after his brother\\'s first report of the snow,\\ncame back again, and told them that he had been out of doors to\\nexamine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty\\nin their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour\\nhence. He had gone beyond the sweep—some way along the Highbury\\nroad—the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep—in many places hardly\\nenough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present,\\nbut the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its\\nbeing soon over. He had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with\\nhim in there being nothing to apprehend.\\nTo Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were\\nscarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father\\'s account, who was\\nimmediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous\\nconstitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be\\nappeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at\\nRandalls. He was satisfied of there being no present danger in\\nreturning home, but no assurances could convince him that it was safe\\nto stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending,\\nMr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus—\\n\"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?\"\\n\"I am ready, if the others are.\"\\n\"Shall I ring the bell?\"\\n\"Yes, do.\"\\nAnd the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes\\nmore, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his\\nown house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his temper and\\nhappiness when this visit of hardship were over.\\nThe carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such',\n",

She believed he had\\nbeen drinking too much of Mr. Weston\\'s good wine, and felt sure that he\\nwould want to be talking nonsense.\\nTo restrain him as much as might be, by her own manners, she was\\nimmediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of\\nthe weather and the night; but scarcely had she begun, scarcely had\\nthey passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she\\nfound her subject cut up—her hand seized—her attention demanded, and\\nMr. Elton actually making violent love to her: availing himself of the\\nprecious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well\\nknown, hoping—fearing—adoring—ready to die if she refused him; but\\nflattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and\\nunexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short,\\nvery much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It\\nreally was so. Without scruple—without apology—without much apparent\\ndiffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself\\n_her_ lover. She tried to stop him; but vainly; he would go on, and say\\nit all. Angry as she was, the thought of the moment made her resolve to\\nrestrain herself when she did speak. She felt that half this folly must\\nbe drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to\\nthe passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the\\nplayful, which she hoped would best suit his half and half state, she\\nreplied,\\n\"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to _me_! you forget\\nyourself—you take me for my friend—any message to Miss Smith I shall be\\nhappy to deliver; but no more of this to _me_, if you please.\"\\n\"Miss Smith!—message to Miss Smith!—What could she possibly mean!\"—And\\nhe repeated her words with such assurance of accent, such boastful\\npretence of amazement, that she could not help replying with quickness,\\n\"Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account\\nfor it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak\\neither to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough\\nto say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it.\"\\nBut Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his spirits, not at\\nall to confuse his intellects. He perfectly knew his own meaning; and\\nhaving warmly protested against her suspicion as most injurious, and\\nslightly touched upon his respect for Miss Smith as her friend,—but\\nacknowledging his wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,—he\\nresumed the subject of his own passion, and was very urgent for a\\nfavourable answer.\\nAs she thought less of his inebriety, she thought more of his\\ninconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness,\\nreplied,\\n\"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself\\ntoo clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can\\nexpress. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last\\nmonth, to Miss Smith—such attentions as I have been in the daily habit\\nof observing—to be addressing me in this manner—this is an unsteadiness\\nof character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me,\\nsir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such\\nprofessions.\"\\n\"Good Heaven!\" cried Mr. Elton, \"what can be the meaning of this?—Miss\\nSmith!—I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my\\nexistence—never paid her any attentions, but as your friend: never\\ncared whether she were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she has\\nfancied otherwise, her own wishes have misled her, and I am very\\nsorry—extremely sorry—But, Miss Smith, indeed!—Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who\\ncan think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my\\nhonour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of\\nyou. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one\\nelse. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has\\nbeen with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot\\nreally, seriously, doubt it. No!—(in an accent meant to be\\ninsinuating)—I am sure you have seen and understood me.\"\\nIt would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this—which of',\n",

It confesses that you have long understood me.\"\\n\"No, sir,\" cried Emma, \"it confesses no such thing. So far from having\\nlong understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect\\nto your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you\\nshould have been giving way to any feelings—Nothing could be farther\\nfrom my wishes—your attachment to my friend Harriet—your pursuit of\\nher, (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been\\nvery earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she were\\nnot your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you\\njudged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you\\nhave never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss\\nSmith?—that you have never thought seriously of her?\"\\n\"Never, madam,\" cried he, affronted in his turn: \"never, I assure you.\\n_I_ think seriously of Miss Smith!—Miss Smith is a very good sort of\\ngirl; and I should be happy to see her respectably settled. I wish her\\nextremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object\\nto—Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think,\\nquite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal\\nalliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith!—No, madam, my\\nvisits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement\\nI received—\"\\n\"Encouragement!—I give you encouragement!—Sir, you have been entirely\\nmistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my\\nfriend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common\\nacquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake\\nends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might\\nhave been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware,\\nprobably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you\\nare so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I\\ntrust, will not be lasting.

If\\nthere had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate\\nawkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the\\nlittle zigzags of embarrassment.

       "   'text': 'The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think\\nand be miserable.—It was a wretched business indeed!—Such an overthrow\\nof every thing she had been wishing for!—Such a development of every\\nthing most unwelcome!—Such a blow for Harriet!—that was the worst of\\nall. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or\\nother; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she\\nwould gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken—more in\\nerror—more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she actually was, could the\\neffects of her blunders have been confined to herself.\\n\"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne\\nany thing. He might have doubled his presumption to me—but poor\\nHarriet!\"\\nHow she could have been so deceived!—He protested that he had never\\nthought seriously of Harriet—never! She looked back as well as she\\ncould; but it was all confusion. She had taken up the idea, she\\nsupposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must\\nhave been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she could not have been so\\nmisled.\\nThe picture!—How eager he had been about the picture!—and the\\ncharade!—and an hundred other circumstances;—how clearly they had\\nseemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its \"ready\\nwit\"—but then the \"soft eyes\"—in fact it suited neither; it was a\\njumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such\\nthick-headed nonsense?\\nCertainly she had often, especially of late, thought his manners to\\nherself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his way, as a mere\\nerror of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others\\nthat he had not always lived in the best society, that with all the\\ngentleness of his address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but,\\ntill this very day, she had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean\\nany thing but grateful respect to her as Harriet\\'s friend.\\nTo Mr. John Knightley was she indebted for her first idea on the\\nsubject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying\\nthat those brothers had penetration. She remembered what Mr. Knightley\\nhad once said to her about Mr. Elton, the caution he had given, the\\nconviction he had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry\\nindiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his\\ncharacter had been there shewn than any she had reached herself. It was\\ndreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many\\nrespects, the very reverse of what she had meant and believed him;\\nproud, assuming, conceited; very full of his own claims, and little\\nconcerned about the feelings of others.\\nContrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton\\'s wanting to pay his\\naddresses to her had sunk him in her opinion. His professions and his\\nproposals did him no service. She thought nothing of his attachment,\\nand was insulted by his hopes. He wanted to marry well, and having the\\narrogance to raise his eyes to her, pretended to be in love; but she\\nwas perfectly easy as to his not suffering any disappointment that need\\nbe cared for. There had been no real affection either in his language\\nor manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she\\ncould hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice,\\nless allied with real love. She need not trouble herself to pity him.\\nHe only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse\\nof Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so\\neasily obtained as he had fancied, he would soon try for Miss Somebody\\nelse with twenty, or with ten.\\nBut—that he should talk of encouragement, should consider her as aware\\nof his views, accepting his attentions, meaning (in short), to marry\\nhim!—should suppose himself her equal in connexion or mind!—look down\\nupon her friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below\\nhim, and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no\\npresumption in addressing her!—It was most provoking.\\nPerhaps it was not fair to expect him to feel how very much he was her\\ninferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of\\nsuch equality might prevent his perception of it; but he must know that\\nin fortune and consequence she was greatly his superior. He must know\\nthat the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at\\nHartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family—and that the\\nEltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was\\ninconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate,\\nto which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from\\nother sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell\\nAbbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses\\nhad long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood\\nwhich Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his way as\\nhe could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend\\nhim to notice but his situation and his civility.—But he had fancied\\nher in love with him; that evidently must have been his dependence; and\\nafter raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners\\nand a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and\\nadmit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and\\nobliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her real\\nmotive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and\\ndelicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.\\nIf _she_ had so misinterpreted his feelings, she had little right to\\nwonder that _he_, with self-interest to blind him, should have mistaken\\nhers.\\nThe first error and the worst lay at her door. It was foolish, it was\\nwrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It\\nwas adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought\\nto be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She was quite\\nconcerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.\\n\"Here have I,\" said she, \"actually talked poor Harriet into being very\\nmuch attached to this man. She might never have thought of him but for\\nme; and certainly never would have thought of him with hope, if I had\\nnot assured her of his attachment, for she is as modest and humble as I\\nused to think him. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her\\nnot to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done\\nof me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and\\nchance. I was introducing her into good company, and giving her the\\nopportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have\\nattempted more. But now, poor girl, her peace is cut up for some time.\\nI have been but half a friend to her; and if she were _not_ to feel\\nthis disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any\\nbody else who would be at all desirable for her;—William Coxe—Oh! no, I\\ncould not endure William Coxe—a pert young lawyer.\"\\nShe stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse, and then resumed a\\nmore serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might\\nbe, and must be. The distressing explanation she had to make to\\nHarriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the\\nawkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or\\ndiscontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing\\nresentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her in most\\nunmirthful reflections some time longer, and she went to bed at last\\nwith nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most\\ndreadfully.',\n",

No\\nintercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her on\\nSunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for\\nMr. Elton\\'s absenting himself.\\nIt was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and\\nthough she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some\\nsociety or other, it was very pleasant to have her father so well\\nsatisfied with his being all alone in his own house, too wise to stir\\nout; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep\\nentirely from them,—\\n\"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?\"\\nThese days of confinement would have been, but for her private\\nperplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited\\nher brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his\\ncompanions; and he had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his\\nill-humour at Randalls, that his amiableness never failed him during\\nthe rest of his stay at Hartfield. He was always agreeable and\\nobliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes\\nof cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still\\nsuch an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet,',\n",

She then\\nproceeded to say a good deal more than she felt, of the advantage of\\nsuch an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of\\nlooking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the\\nsight of him would have made; and ending with reflections on the\\nChurchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement\\nwith Mr. Knightley; and, to her great amusement, perceived that she was\\ntaking the other side of the question from her real opinion, and making\\nuse of Mrs. Weston\\'s arguments against herself.\\n\"The Churchills are very likely in fault,\" said Mr. Knightley, coolly;\\n\"but I dare say he might come if he would.\"\\n\"I do not know why you should say so. He wishes exceedingly to come;\\nbut his uncle and aunt will not spare him.\"\\n\"I cannot believe that he has not the power of coming, if he made a\\npoint of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof.\"\\n\"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you\\nsuppose him such an unnatural creature?\"\\n\"I am not supposing him at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting\\nthat he may have learnt to be above his connexions, and to care very\\nlittle for any thing but his own pleasure, from living with those who\\nhave always set him the example of it. It is a great deal more natural\\nthan one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are\\nproud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish\\ntoo. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his father, he would have\\ncontrived it between September and January. A man at his age—what is\\nhe?—three or four-and-twenty—cannot be without the means of doing as\\nmuch as that. It is impossible.\"\\n\"That\\'s easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your\\nown master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the\\ndifficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers\\nto manage.\"\\n\"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty\\nshould not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He cannot want\\nmoney—he cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he has so\\nmuch of both, that he is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts\\nin the kingdom. We hear of him for ever at some watering-place or\\nother. A little while ago, he was at Weymouth. This proves that he can\\nleave the Churchills.\"\\n\"Yes, sometimes he can.\"\\n\"And those times are whenever he thinks it worth his while; whenever\\nthere is any temptation of pleasure.\"\\n\"It is very unfair to judge of any body\\'s conduct, without an intimate\\nknowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior\\nof a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that\\nfamily may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs.\\nChurchill\\'s temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her nephew\\ncan do. He may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he can\\nat others.\"\\n\"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he chuses, and\\nthat is, his duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and\\nresolution. It is Frank Churchill\\'s duty to pay this attention to his\\nfather. He knows it to be so, by his promises and messages; but if he\\nwished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at\\nonce, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill—\\'Every sacrifice of mere\\npleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but\\nI must go and see my father immediately. I know he would be hurt by my\\nfailing in such a mark of respect to him on the present occasion. I\\nshall, therefore, set off to-morrow.\\'—If he would say so to her at\\nonce, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no\\nopposition made to his going.\"\\n\"No,\" said Emma, laughing; \"but perhaps there might be some made to his\\ncoming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to\\nuse!—Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you\\nhave not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite\\nto your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to\\nthe uncle and aunt, who have brought him up, and are to provide for\\nhim!—Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as\\nloud as he could!—How can you imagine such conduct practicable?\"\\n\"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it.\\nHe would feel himself in the right; and the declaration—made, of\\ncourse, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner—would do\\nhim more good, raise him higher, fix his interest stronger with the\\npeople he depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients\\ncan ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that\\nthey could trust him; that the nephew who had done rightly by his\\nfather, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he does, as\\nwell as all the world must know, that he ought to pay this visit to his\\nfather; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their\\nhearts not thinking the better of him for submitting to their whims.\\nRespect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he would act in\\nthis sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their\\nlittle minds would bend to his.\"\\n\"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but\\nwhere little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they\\nhave a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as\\ngreat ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were\\nto be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill\\'s\\nsituation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been\\nrecommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The\\nChurchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would\\nhave no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through.\\nTo him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into\\nperfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and\\nregard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right,\\nas you can have, without being so equal, under particular\\ncircumstances, to act up to it.\"',\n",
