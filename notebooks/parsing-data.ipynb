       "'LINE 1: In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice\\nLINE 2: that I\\'ve been turning over in my mind ever since.\\nLINE 3: \"Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,\" he told me, \"just\\nLINE 4: remember that all the people in this world haven\\'t had the advantages\\nLINE 5: that you\\'ve had.\"\\nLINE 6: He didn\\'t say any more, but we\\'ve always been unusually communicative\\nLINE 7: in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more\\nLINE 8: than that. In consequence, I\\'m inclined to reserve all judgements, a\\nLINE 9: habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me\\nLINE 10: the victim of not a few veteran bores. The abnormal mind is quick to\\nLINE 11: detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal\\nLINE 12: person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of\\nLINE 13: being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild,\\nLINE 14: unknown men. Most of the confidences were unsought—frequently I have\\nLINE 15: feigned sleep, preoccupation, or a hostile levity when I realized by\\nLINE 16: some unmistakable sign that an intimate revelation was quivering on\\nLINE 17: the horizon; for the intimate revelations of young men, or at least\\nLINE 18: the terms in which they express them, are usually plagiaristic and\\nLINE 19: marred by obvious suppressions. Reserving judgements is a matter of\\nLINE 20: infinite hope. I am still a little afraid of missing something if I\\nLINE 21: forget that, as my father snobbishly suggested, and I snobbishly\\nLINE 22: repeat, a sense of the fundamental decencies is parcelled out\\nLINE 23: unequally at birth.\\nLINE 24: And, after boasting this way of my tolerance, I come to the admission\\nLINE 25: that it has a limit. Conduct may be founded on the hard rock or the\\nLINE 26: wet marshes, but after a certain point I don\\'t care what it\\'s founded\\nLINE 27: on. When I came back from the East last autumn I felt that I wanted\\nLINE 28: the world to be in uniform and at a sort of moral attention forever; I\\nLINE 29: wanted no more riotous excursions with privileged glimpses into the\\nLINE 30: human heart. Only Gatsby, the man who gives his name to this book, was\\nLINE 31: exempt from my reaction—Gatsby, who represented everything for which I\\nLINE 32: have an unaffected scorn. If personality is an unbroken series of\\nLINE 33: successful gestures, then there was something gorgeous about him, some\\nLINE 34: heightened sensitivity to the promises of life, as if he were related\\nLINE 35: to one of those intricate machines that register earthquakes ten\\nLINE 36: thousand miles away. This responsiveness had nothing to do with that\\nLINE 37: flabby impressionability which is dignified under the name of the\\nLINE 38: \"creative temperament\"—it was an extraordinary gift for hope, a\\nLINE 39: romantic readiness such as I have never found in any other person and\\nLINE 40: which it is not likely I shall ever find again. No—Gatsby turned out\\nLINE 41: all right at the end; it is what preyed on Gatsby, what foul dust\\nLINE 42: floated in the wake of his dreams that temporarily closed out my\\nLINE 43: interest in the abortive sorrows and short-winded elations of men.\\nLINE 44: ------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLINE 45: My family have been prominent, well-to-do people in this Middle\\nLINE 46: Western city for three generations. The Carraways are something of a\\nLINE 47: clan, and we have a tradition that we\\'re descended from the Dukes of\\nLINE 48: Buccleuch, but the actual founder of my line was my grandfather\\'s\\nLINE 49: brother, who came here in fifty-one, sent a substitute to the Civil\\nLINE 50: War, and started the wholesale hardware business that my father\\nLINE 51: carries on today.\\nLINE 52: I never saw this great-uncle, but I\\'m supposed to look like him—with\\nLINE 53: special reference to the rather hard-boiled painting that hangs in\\nLINE 54: father\\'s office. I graduated from New Haven in 1915, just a quarter of\\nLINE 55: a century after my father, and a little later I participated in that\\nLINE 56: delayed Teutonic migration known as the Great War. I enjoyed the\\nLINE 57: counter-raid so thoroughly that I came back restless. Instead of being\\nLINE 58: the warm centre of the world, the Middle West now seemed like the\\nLINE 59: ragged edge of the universe—so I decided to go East and learn the bond\\nLINE 60: business. Everybody I knew was in the bond business, so I supposed it\\nLINE 61: could support one more single man. All my aunts and uncles talked it\\nLINE 62: over as if they were choosing a prep school for me, and finally said,\\nLINE 63: \"Why—ye-es,\" with very grave, hesitant faces. Father agreed to finance\\nLINE 64: me for a year, and after various delays I came East, permanently, I\\nLINE 65: thought, in the spring of twenty-two.\\nLINE 66: The practical thing was to find rooms in the city, but it was a warm\\nLINE 67: season, and I had just left a country of wide lawns and friendly\\nLINE 68: trees, so when a young man at the office suggested that we take a\\nLINE 69: house together in a commuting town, it sounded like a great idea. He\\nLINE 70: found the house, a weather-beaten cardboard bungalow at eighty a\\nLINE 71: month, but at the last minute the firm ordered him to Washington, and\\nLINE 72: I went out to the country alone. I had a dog—at least I had him for a\\nLINE 73: few days until he ran away—and an old Dodge and a Finnish woman, who\\nLINE 74: made my bed and cooked breakfast and muttered Finnish wisdom to\\nLINE 75: herself over the electric stove.\\nLINE 76: It was lonely for a day or so until one morning some man, more\\nLINE 77: recently arrived than I, stopped me on the road.\\nLINE 78: \"How do you get to West Egg village?\" he asked helplessly.\\nLINE 79: I told him. And as I walked on I was lonely no longer. I was a guide,\\nLINE 80: a pathfinder, an original settler. He had casually conferred on me the\\nLINE 81: freedom of the neighbourhood.\\nLINE 82: And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\\nLINE 83: trees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar\\nLINE 84: conviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\\nLINE 85: There was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to\\nLINE 86: be pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\\nLINE 87: volumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they\\nLINE 88: stood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,\\nLINE 89: promising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and\\nLINE 90: Maecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other\\nLINE 91: books besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a\\nLINE 92: series of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now\\nLINE 93: I was going to bring back all such things into my life and become\\nLINE 94: again that most limited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\"\\nLINE 95: This isn\\'t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at\\nLINE 96: from a single window, after all.\\nLINE 97: It was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\\nLINE 98: the strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\\nLINE 99: riotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where\\nLINE 100: there are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\\nLINE 101: land. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\\nLINE 102: contour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\\nLINE 103: domesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great\\nLINE 104: wet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the\\nLINE 105: egg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact\\nLINE 106: end—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\\nLINE 107: wonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\\nLINE 108: interesting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular\\nLINE 109: except shape and size.\\nLINE 110: I lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though\\nLINE 111: this is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\\nLINE 112: sinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\\nLINE 113: egg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\\nLINE 114: places that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\\nLINE 115: my right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual\\nLINE 116: imitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one\\nLINE 117: side, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble\\nLINE 118: swimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was\\nLINE 119: Gatsby\\'s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn\\'t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a\\nLINE 120: mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an\\nLINE 121: eyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I\\nLINE 122: had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour\\'s lawn, and\\nLINE 123: the consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a\\nLINE 124: month.\\nLINE 125: Across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable East Egg\\nLINE 126: glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins\\nLINE 127: on the evening I drove over there to have dinner with the Tom\\nLINE 128: Buchanans. Daisy was my second cousin once removed, and I\\'d known Tom\\nLINE 129: in college. And just after the war I spent two days with them in\\nLINE 130: Chicago.\\nLINE 131: Her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of\\nLINE 132: the most powerful ends that ever played football at New Haven—a\\nLINE 133: national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute\\nLINE 134: limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savours of\\nLINE 135: anticlimax. His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his\\nLINE 136: freedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he\\'d left Chicago\\nLINE 137: and come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\\nLINE 138: instance, he\\'d brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\\nLINE 139: Forest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was\\nLINE 140: wealthy enough to do that.\\nLINE 141: Why they came East I don\\'t know. They had spent a year in France for\\nLINE 142: no particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully\\nLINE 143: wherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a\\nLINE 144: permanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn\\'t believe\\nLINE 145: it—I had no sight into Daisy\\'s heart, but I felt that Tom would drift\\nLINE 146: on forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of\\nLINE 147: some irrecoverable football game.\\nLINE 148: And so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\\nLINE 149: Egg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house\\nLINE 150: was even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white\\nLINE 151: Georgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at\\nLINE 152: the beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,\\nLINE 153: jumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when\\nLINE 154: it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though\\nLINE 155: from the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French\\nLINE 156: windows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm\\nLINE 157: windy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with\\nLINE 158: his legs apart on the front porch.\\nLINE 159: He had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy\\nLINE 160: straw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\\nLINE 161: supercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\\nLINE 162: dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\\nLINE 163: aggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\\nLINE 164: clothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill\\nLINE 165: those glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\\nLINE 166: see a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\\nLINE 167: thin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\\nLINE 168: His speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\\nLINE 169: fractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\\nLINE 170: it, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who\\nLINE 171: had hated his guts.\\nLINE 172: \"Now, don\\'t think my opinion on these matters is final,\" he seemed to\\nLINE 173: say, \"just because I\\'m stronger and more of a man than you are.\" We\\nLINE 174: were in the same senior society, and while we were never intimate I\\nLINE 175: always had the impression that he approved of me and wanted me to like\\nLINE 176: him with some harsh, defiant wistfulness of his own.\\nLINE 177: We talked for a few minutes on the sunny porch.\\nLINE 178: \"I\\'ve got a nice place here,\" he said, his eyes flashing about\\nLINE 179: restlessly.\\nLINE 180: Turning me around by one arm, he moved a broad flat hand along the\\nLINE 181: front vista, including in its sweep a sunken Italian garden, a half\\nLINE 182: acre of deep, pungent roses, and a snub-nosed motorboat that bumped\\nLINE 183: the tide offshore.\\nLINE 184: \"It belonged to Demaine, the oil man.\" He turned me around again,\\nLINE 185: politely and abruptly. \"We\\'ll go inside.\"\\nLINE 186: We walked through a high hallway into a bright rosy-coloured space,\\nLINE 187: fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end. The\\nLINE 188: windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\\nLINE 189: that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\\nLINE 190: the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\\nLINE 191: flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\\nLINE 192: ceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\\nLINE 193: on it as wind does on the sea.\\nLINE 194: The only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\\nLINE 195: couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\\nLINE 196: anchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\\nLINE 197: rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\\nLINE 198: short flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\\nLINE 199: listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\\nLINE 200: picture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\\nLINE 201: rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\\nLINE 202: curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\\nLINE 203: floor.\\nLINE 204: The younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\\nLINE 205: length at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\\nLINE 206: chin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\\nLINE 207: was quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\\nLINE 208: she gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\\nLINE 209: an apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\\nLINE 210: The other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly\\nLINE 211: forward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,\\nLINE 212: charming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\\nLINE 213: room.\\nLINE 214: \"I\\'m p-paralysed with happiness.\"\\nLINE 215: She laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\\nLINE 216: hand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\\nLINE 217: no one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\\nLINE 218: had. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\\nLINE 219: Baker. (I\\'ve heard it said that Daisy\\'s murmur was only to make people\\nLINE 220: lean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\\nLINE 221: charming.)\\nLINE 222: At any rate, Miss Baker\\'s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\\nLINE 223: imperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object\\nLINE 224: she was balancing had obviously tottered a little and given her\\nLINE 225: something of a fright. Again a sort of apology arose to my lips.\\nLINE 226: Almost any exhibition of complete self-sufficiency draws a stunned\\nLINE 227: tribute from me.\\nLINE 228: I looked back at my cousin, who began to ask me questions in her low,\\nLINE 229: thrilling voice. It was the kind of voice that the ear follows up and\\nLINE 230: down, as if each speech is an arrangement of notes that will never be\\nLINE 231: played again. Her face was sad and lovely with bright things in it,\\nLINE 232: bright eyes and a bright passionate mouth, but there was an excitement\\nLINE 233: in her voice that men who had cared for her found difficult to forget:\\nLINE 234: a singing compulsion, a whispered \"Listen,\" a promise that she had\\nLINE 235: done gay, exciting things just a while since and that there were gay,\\nLINE 236: exciting things hovering in the next hour.\\nLINE 237: I told her how I had stopped off in Chicago for a day on my way East,\\nLINE 238: and how a dozen people had sent their love through me.\\nLINE 239: \"Do they miss me?\" she cried ecstatically.\\nLINE 240: \"The whole town is desolate. All the cars have the left rear wheel\\nLINE 241: painted black as a mourning wreath, and there\\'s a persistent wail all\\nLINE 242: night along the north shore.\"\\nLINE 243: \"How gorgeous! Let\\'s go back, Tom. Tomorrow!\" Then she added\\nLINE 244: irrelevantly: \"You ought to see the baby.\"\\nLINE 245: \"I\\'d like to.\"\\nLINE 246: \"She\\'s asleep. She\\'s three years old. Haven\\'t you ever seen her?\"\\nLINE 247: \"Never.\"\\nLINE 248: \"Well, you ought to see her. She\\'s—\"\\nLINE 249: Tom Buchanan, who had been hovering restlessly about the room, stopped\\nLINE 250: and rested his hand on my shoulder.\\nLINE 251: \"What you doing, Nick?\"\\nLINE 252: \"I\\'m a bond man.\"\\nLINE 253: \"Who with?\"\\nLINE 254: I told him.\\nLINE 255: \"Never heard of them,\" he remarked decisively.\\nLINE 256: This annoyed me.\\nLINE 257: \"You will,\" I answered shortly. \"You will if you stay in the East.\"\\nLINE 258: \"Oh, I\\'ll stay in the East, don\\'t you worry,\" he said, glancing at\\nLINE 259: Daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something\\nLINE 260: more. \"I\\'d be a God damned fool to live anywhere else.\"\\nLINE 261: At this point Miss Baker said: \"Absolutely!\" with such suddenness that\\nLINE 262: I started—it was the first word she had uttered since I came into the\\nLINE 263: room. Evidently it surprised her as much as it did me, for she yawned\\nLINE 264: and with a series of rapid, deft movements stood up into the room.\\nLINE 265: \"I\\'m stiff,\" she complained, \"I\\'ve been lying on that sofa for as long\\nLINE 266: as I can remember.\"\\nLINE 267: \"Don\\'t look at me,\" Daisy retorted, \"I\\'ve been trying to get you to\\nLINE 268: New York all afternoon.\"\\nLINE 269: \"No, thanks,\" said Miss Baker to the four cocktails just in from the\\nLINE 270: pantry. \"I\\'m absolutely in training.\"\\nLINE 271: Her host looked at her incredulously.\\nLINE 272: \"You are!\" He took down his drink as if it were a drop in the bottom\\nLINE 273: of a glass. \"How you ever get anything done is beyond me.\"\\nLINE 274: I looked at Miss Baker, wondering what it was she \"got done.\" I\\nLINE 275: enjoyed looking at her. She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\\nLINE 276: an erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\\nLINE 277: at the shoulders like a young cadet. Her grey sun-strained eyes looked\\nLINE 278: back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming,\\nLINE 279: discontented face. It occurred to me now that I had seen her, or a\\nLINE 280: picture of her, somewhere before.\\nLINE 281: \"You live in West Egg,\" she remarked contemptuously. \"I know somebody\\nLINE 282: there.\"\\nLINE 283: \"I don\\'t know a single—\"\\nLINE 284: \"You must know Gatsby.\"\\nLINE 285: \"Gatsby?\" demanded Daisy. \"What Gatsby?\"\\nLINE 286: Before I could reply that he was my neighbour dinner was announced;\\nLINE 287: wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine, Tom Buchanan compelled\\nLINE 288: me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.\\nLINE 289: Slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips, the two\\nLINE 290: young women preceded us out on to a rosy-coloured porch, open toward\\nLINE 291: the sunset, where four candles flickered on the table in the\\nLINE 292: diminished wind.\\nLINE 293: \"Why candles?\" objected Daisy, frowning. She snapped them out with her\\nLINE 294: fingers. \"In two weeks it\\'ll be the longest day in the year.\" She\\nLINE 295: looked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\\nLINE 296: of the year and then miss it? I always watch for the longest day in\\nLINE 297: the year and then miss it.\"\\nLINE 298: \"We ought to plan something,\" yawned Miss Baker, sitting down at the\\nLINE 299: table as if she were getting into bed.\\nLINE 300: \"All right,\" said Daisy. \"What\\'ll we plan?\" She turned to me\\nLINE 301: helplessly: \"What do people plan?\"\\nLINE 302: Before I could answer her eyes fastened with an awed expression on her\\nLINE 303: little finger.\\nLINE 304: \"Look!\" she complained; \"I hurt it.\"\\nLINE 305: We all looked—the knuckle was black and blue.\\nLINE 306: \"You did it, Tom,\" she said accusingly. \"I know you didn\\'t mean to,\\nLINE 307: but you did do it. That\\'s what I get for marrying a brute of a man, a\\nLINE 308: great, big, hulking physical specimen of a—\"\\nLINE 309: \"I hate that word \\'hulking,\\'\\u200a\" objected Tom crossly, \"even in\\nLINE 310: kidding.\"\\nLINE 311: \"Hulking,\" insisted Daisy.\\nLINE 312: Sometimes she and Miss Baker talked at once, unobtrusively and with a\\nLINE 313: bantering inconsequence that was never quite chatter, that was as cool\\nLINE 314: as their white dresses and their impersonal eyes in the absence of all\\nLINE 315: desire. They were here, and they accepted Tom and me, making only a\\nLINE 316: polite pleasant effort to entertain or to be entertained. They knew\\nLINE 317: that presently dinner would be over and a little later the evening too\\nLINE 318: would be over and casually put away. It was sharply different from the\\nLINE 319: West, where an evening was hurried from phase to phase towards its\\nLINE 320: close, in a continually disappointed anticipation or else in sheer\\nLINE 321: nervous dread of the moment itself.\\nLINE 322: \"You make me feel uncivilized, Daisy,\" I confessed on my second glass\\nLINE 323: of corky but rather impressive claret. \"Can\\'t you talk about crops or\\nLINE 324: something?\"\\nLINE 325: I meant nothing in particular by this remark, but it was taken up in\\nLINE 326: an unexpected way.\\nLINE 327: \"Civilization\\'s going to pieces,\" broke out Tom violently. \"I\\'ve\\nLINE 328: gotten to be a terrible pessimist about things. Have you read The Rise\\nLINE 329: of the Coloured Empires by this man Goddard?\"\\nLINE 330: \"Why, no,\" I answered, rather surprised by his tone.\\nLINE 331: \"Well, it\\'s a fine book, and everybody ought to read it. The idea is\\nLINE 332: if we don\\'t look out the white race will be—will be utterly\\nLINE 333: submerged. It\\'s all scientific stuff; it\\'s been proved.\"\\nLINE 334: \"Tom\\'s getting very profound,\" said Daisy, with an expression of\\nLINE 335: unthoughtful sadness. \"He reads deep books with long words in\\nLINE 336: them. What was that word we—\"\\nLINE 337: \"Well, these books are all scientific,\" insisted Tom, glancing at her\\nLINE 338: impatiently. \"This fellow has worked out the whole thing. It\\'s up to\\nLINE 339: us, who are the dominant race, to watch out or these other races will\\nLINE 340: have control of things.\"\\nLINE 341: \"We\\'ve got to beat them down,\" whispered Daisy, winking ferociously\\nLINE 342: toward the fervent sun.\\nLINE 343: \"You ought to live in California—\" began Miss Baker, but Tom\\nLINE 344: interrupted her by shifting heavily in his chair.\\nLINE 345: \"This idea is that we\\'re Nordics. I am, and you are, and you are,\\nLINE 346: and—\" After an infinitesimal hesitation he included Daisy with a\\nLINE 347: slight nod, and she winked at me again. \"—And we\\'ve produced all the\\nLINE 348: things that go to make civilization—oh, science and art, and all\\nLINE 349: that. Do you see?\"\\nLINE 350: There was something pathetic in his concentration, as if his\\nLINE 351: complacency, more acute than of old, was not enough to him any more.\\nLINE 352: When, almost immediately, the telephone rang inside and the butler\\nLINE 353: left the porch Daisy seized upon the momentary interruption and leaned\\nLINE 354: towards me.\\nLINE 355: \"I\\'ll tell you a family secret,\" she whispered enthusiastically.\\nLINE 356: \"It\\'s about the butler\\'s nose. Do you want to hear about the butler\\'s\\nLINE 357: nose?\"\\nLINE 358: \"That\\'s why I came over tonight.\"\\nLINE 359: \"Well, he wasn\\'t always a butler; he used to be the silver polisher\\nLINE 360: for some people in New York that had a silver service for two hundred\\nLINE 361: people. He had to polish it from morning till night, until finally it\\nLINE 362: began to affect his nose—\"\\nLINE 363: \"Things went from bad to worse,\" suggested Miss Baker.\\nLINE 364: \"Yes. Things went from bad to worse, until finally he had to give up\\nLINE 365: his position.\"\\nLINE 366: For a moment the last sunshine fell with romantic affection upon her\\nLINE 367: glowing face; her voice compelled me forward breathlessly as I\\nLINE 368: listened—then the glow faded, each light deserting her with lingering\\nLINE 369: regret, like children leaving a pleasant street at dusk.\\nLINE 370: The butler came back and murmured something close to Tom\\'s ear,\\nLINE 371: whereupon Tom frowned, pushed back his chair, and without a word went\\nLINE 372: inside. As if his absence quickened something within her, Daisy leaned\\nLINE 373: forward again, her voice glowing and singing.\\nLINE 374: \"I love to see you at my table, Nick. You remind me of a—of a rose, an\\nLINE 375: absolute rose. Doesn\\'t he?\" She turned to Miss Baker for confirmation:\\nLINE 376: \"An absolute rose?\"\\nLINE 377: This was untrue. I am not even faintly like a rose. She was only\\nLINE 378: extemporizing, but a stirring warmth flowed from her, as if her heart\\nLINE 379: was trying to come out to you concealed in one of those breathless,\\nLINE 380: thrilling words. Then suddenly she threw her napkin on the table and\\nLINE 381: excused herself and went into the house.\\nLINE 382: Miss Baker and I exchanged a short glance consciously devoid of\\nLINE 383: meaning. I was about to speak when she sat up alertly and said \"Sh!\"\\nLINE 384: in a warning voice. A subdued impassioned murmur was audible in the\\nLINE 385: room beyond, and Miss Baker leaned forward unashamed, trying to\\nLINE 386: hear. The murmur trembled on the verge of coherence, sank down,\\nLINE 387: mounted excitedly, and then ceased altogether.\\nLINE 388: \"This Mr. Gatsby you spoke of is my neighbour—\" I began.\\nLINE 389: \"Don\\'t talk. I want to hear what happens.\"\\nLINE 390: \"Is something happening?\" I inquired innocently.\\nLINE 391: \"You mean to say you don\\'t know?\" said Miss Baker, honestly surprised.\\nLINE 392: \"I thought everybody knew.\"\\nLINE 393: \"I don\\'t.\"\\nLINE 394: \"Why—\" she said hesitantly. \"Tom\\'s got some woman in New York.\"\\nLINE 395: \"Got some woman?\" I repeated blankly.\\nLINE 396: Miss Baker nodded.\\nLINE 397: \"She might have the decency not to telephone him at dinner time.\\nLINE 398: Don\\'t you think?\"\\nLINE 399: Almost before I had grasped her meaning there was the flutter of a\\nLINE 400: dress and the crunch of leather boots, and Tom and Daisy were back at\\nLINE 401: the table.\\nLINE 402: \"It couldn\\'t be helped!\" cried Daisy with tense gaiety.\\nLINE 403: She sat down, glanced searchingly at Miss Baker and then at me, and\\nLINE 404: continued: \"I looked outdoors for a minute, and it\\'s very romantic\\nLINE 405: outdoors. There\\'s a bird on the lawn that I think must be a\\nLINE 406: nightingale come over on the Cunard or White Star Line. He\\'s singing\\nLINE 407: away—\" Her voice sang: \"It\\'s romantic, isn\\'t it, Tom?\"\\nLINE 408: \"Very romantic,\" he said, and then miserably to me: \"If it\\'s light\\nLINE 409: enough after dinner, I want to take you down to the stables.\"\\nLINE 410: The telephone rang inside, startlingly, and as Daisy shook her head\\nLINE 411: decisively at Tom the subject of the stables, in fact all subjects,\\nLINE 412: vanished into air. Among the broken fragments of the last five minutes\\nLINE 413: at table I remember the candles being lit again, pointlessly, and I\\nLINE 414: was conscious of wanting to look squarely at everyone, and yet to\\nLINE 415: avoid all eyes. I couldn\\'t guess what Daisy and Tom were thinking, but\\nLINE 416: I doubt if even Miss Baker, who seemed to have mastered a certain\\nLINE 417: hardy scepticism, was able utterly to put this fifth guest\\'s shrill\\nLINE 418: metallic urgency out of mind. To a certain temperament the situation\\nLINE 419: might have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone\\nLINE 420: immediately for the police.\\nLINE 421: The horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\\nLINE 422: Baker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into\\nLINE 423: the library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\\nLINE 424: trying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed\\nLINE 425: Daisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\\nLINE 426: its deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\\nLINE 427: Daisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and\\nLINE 428: her eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that\\nLINE 429: turbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\\nLINE 430: some sedative questions about her little girl.\\nLINE 431: \"We don\\'t know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly. \"Even\\nLINE 432: if we are cousins. You didn\\'t come to my wedding.\"\\nLINE 433: \"I wasn\\'t back from the war.\"\\nLINE 434: \"That\\'s true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I\\'ve had a very bad time, Nick,\\nLINE 435: and I\\'m pretty cynical about everything.\"\\nLINE 436: Evidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn\\'t say any more,\\nLINE 437: and after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\\nLINE 438: daughter.\\nLINE 439: \"I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.\"\\nLINE 440: \"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you\\nLINE 441: what I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\\nLINE 442: \"Very much.\"\\nLINE 443: \"It\\'ll show you how I\\'ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was\\nLINE 444: less than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of\\nLINE 445: the ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right\\nLINE 446: away if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I\\nLINE 447: turned my head away and wept. \\'All right,\\' I said, \\'I\\'m glad it\\'s a\\nLINE 448: girl. And I hope she\\'ll be a fool—that\\'s the best thing a girl can be\\nLINE 449: in this world, a beautiful little fool.\\'\\nLINE 450: \"You see I think everything\\'s terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\\nLINE 451: convinced way. \"Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people. And I\\nLINE 452: know. I\\'ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\\nLINE 453: Her eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom\\'s, and\\nLINE 454: she laughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated—God, I\\'m\\nLINE 455: sophisticated!\"\\nLINE 456: The instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my\\nLINE 457: belief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me\\nLINE 458: uneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to\\nLINE 459: exact a contributory emotion from me. I waited, and sure enough, in a\\nLINE 460: moment she looked at me with an absolute smirk on her lovely face, as\\nLINE 461: if she had asserted her membership in a rather distinguished secret\\nLINE 462: society to which she and Tom belonged.\\nLINE 463: ------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nLINE 464: Inside, the crimson room bloomed with light. Tom and Miss Baker sat at\\nLINE 465: either end of the long couch and she read aloud to him from the\\nLINE 466: Saturday Evening Post—the words, murmurous and uninflected, running\\nLINE 467: together in a soothing tune. The lamplight, bright on his boots and\\nLINE 468: dull on the autumn-leaf yellow of her hair, glinted along the paper as\\nLINE 469: she turned a page with a flutter of slender muscles in her arms.\\nLINE 470: When we came in she held us silent for a moment with a lifted hand.\\nLINE 471: \"To be continued,\" she said, tossing the magazine on the table, \"in\\nLINE 472: our very next issue.\"\\nLINE 473: Her body asserted itself with a restless movement of her knee, and she\\nLINE 474: stood up.\\nLINE 475: \"Ten o\\'clock,\" she remarked, apparently finding the time on the\\nLINE 476: ceiling. \"Time for this good girl to go to bed.\"\\nLINE 477: \"Jordan\\'s going to play in the tournament tomorrow,\" explained Daisy,\\nLINE 478: \"over at Westchester.\"\\nLINE 479: \"Oh—you\\'re Jordan Baker.\"\\nLINE 480: I knew now why her face was familiar—its pleasing contemptuous\\nLINE 481: expression had looked out at me from many rotogravure pictures of the\\nLINE 482: sporting life at Asheville and Hot Springs and Palm Beach. I had heard\\nLINE 483: some story of her too, a critical, unpleasant story, but what it was I\\nLINE 484: had forgotten long ago.\\nLINE 485: \"Good night,\" she said softly. \"Wake me at eight, won\\'t you.\"\\nLINE 486: \"If you\\'ll get up.\"\\nLINE 487: \"I will. Good night, Mr. Carraway. See you anon.\"\\nLINE 488: \"Of course you will,\" confirmed Daisy. \"In fact I think I\\'ll arrange a\\nLINE 489: marriage. Come over often, Nick, and I\\'ll sort of—oh—fling you\\nLINE 490: together. You know—lock you up accidentally in linen closets and push\\nLINE 491: you out to sea in a boat, and all that sort of thing—\"\\nLINE 492: \"Good night,\" called Miss Baker from the stairs. \"I haven\\'t heard a\\nLINE 493: word.\"\\nLINE 494: \"She\\'s a nice girl,\" said Tom after a moment. \"They oughtn\\'t to let\\nLINE 495: her run around the country this way.\"\\nLINE 496: \"Who oughtn\\'t to?\" inquired Daisy coldly.\\nLINE 497: \"Her family.\"\\nLINE 498: \"Her family is one aunt about a thousand years old. Besides, Nick\\'s\\nLINE 499: going to look after her, aren\\'t you, Nick? She\\'s going to spend lots\\nLINE 500: of weekends out here this summer. I think the home influence will be\\nLINE 501: very good for her.\"\\nLINE 502: Daisy and Tom looked at each other for a moment in silence.\\nLINE 503: \"Is she from New York?\" I asked quickly.\\nLINE 504: \"From Louisville. Our white girlhood was passed together there. Our\\nLINE 505: beautiful white—\"\\nLINE 506: \"Did you give Nick a little heart to heart talk on the veranda?\"\\nLINE 507: demanded Tom suddenly.\\nLINE 508: \"Did I?\" She looked at me. \"I can\\'t seem to remember, but I think we\\nLINE 509: talked about the Nordic race. Yes, I\\'m sure we did. It sort of crept\\nLINE 510: up on us and first thing you know—\"\\nLINE 511: \"Don\\'t believe everything you hear, Nick,\" he advised me.\\nLINE 512: I said lightly that I had heard nothing at all, and a few minutes\\nLINE 513: later I got up to go home. They came to the door with me and stood\\nLINE 514: side by side in a cheerful square of light. As I started my motor\\nLINE 515: Daisy peremptorily called: \"Wait!\\nLINE 516: \"I forgot to ask you something, and it\\'s important. We heard you were\\nLINE 517: engaged to a girl out West.\"\\nLINE 518: \"That\\'s right,\" corroborated Tom kindly. \"We heard that you were\\nLINE 519: engaged.\"\\nLINE 520: \"It\\'s a libel. I\\'m too poor.\"\\nLINE 521: \"But we heard it,\" insisted Daisy, surprising me by opening up again\\nLINE 522: in a flower-like way. \"We heard it from three people, so it must be\\nLINE 523: true.\"\\nLINE 524: Of course I knew what they were referring to, but I wasn\\'t even\\nLINE 525: vaguely engaged. The fact that gossip had published the banns was one\\nLINE 526: of the reasons I had come East. You can\\'t stop going with an old\\nLINE 527: friend on account of rumours, and on the other hand I had no intention\\nLINE 528: of being rumoured into marriage.\\nLINE 529: Their interest rather touched me and made them less remotely\\nLINE 530: rich—nevertheless, I was confused and a little disgusted as I drove\\nLINE 531: away. It seemed to me that the thing for Daisy to do was to rush out\\nLINE 532: of the house, child in arms—but apparently there were no such\\nLINE 533: intentions in her head. As for Tom, the fact that he \"had some woman\\nLINE 534: in New York\" was really less surprising than that he had been\\nLINE 535: depressed by a book. Something was making him nibble at the edge of\\nLINE 536: stale ideas as if his sturdy physical egotism no longer nourished his\\nLINE 537: peremptory heart.\\nLINE 538: Already it was deep summer on roadhouse roofs and in front of wayside\\nLINE 539: garages, where new red petrol-pumps sat out in pools of light, and\\nLINE 540: when I reached my estate at West Egg I ran the car under its shed and\\nLINE 541: sat for a while on an abandoned grass roller in the yard. The wind had\\nLINE 542: blown off, leaving a loud, bright night, with wings beating in the\\nLINE 543: trees and a persistent organ sound as the full bellows of the earth\\nLINE 544: blew the frogs full of life. The silhouette of a moving cat wavered\\nLINE 545: across the moonlight, and, turning my head to watch it, I saw that I\\nLINE 546: was not alone—fifty feet away a figure had emerged from the shadow of\\nLINE 547: my neighbour\\'s mansion and was standing with his hands in his pockets\\nLINE 548: regarding the silver pepper of the stars. Something in his leisurely\\nLINE 549: movements and the secure position of his feet upon the lawn suggested\\nLINE 550: that it was Mr. Gatsby himself, come out to determine what share was\\nLINE 551: his of our local heavens.\\nLINE 552: I decided to call to him. Miss Baker had mentioned him at dinner, and\\nLINE 553: that would do for an introduction. But I didn\\'t call to him, for he\\nLINE 554: gave a sudden intimation that he was content to be alone—he stretched\\nLINE 555: out his arms toward the dark water in a curious way, and, far as I was\\nLINE 556: from him, I could have sworn he was trembling. Involuntarily I glanced\\nLINE 557: seaward—and distinguished nothing except a single green light, minute\\nLINE 558: and far away, that might have been the end of a dock. When I looked\\nLINE 559: once more for Gatsby he had vanished, and I was alone again in the\\nLINE 560: unquiet darkness.'"

       "   'text': 'And so with the sunshine and the great bursts of leaves growing on the\\ntrees, just as things grow in fast movies, I had that familiar\\nconviction that life was beginning over again with the summer.\\nThere was so much to read, for one thing, and so much fine health to\\nbe pulled down out of the young breath-giving air. I bought a dozen\\nvolumes on banking and credit and investment securities, and they\\nstood on my shelf in red and gold like new money from the mint,\\npromising to unfold the shining secrets that only Midas and Morgan and\\nMaecenas knew. And I had the high intention of reading many other\\nbooks besides. I was rather literary in college—one year I wrote a\\nseries of very solemn and obvious editorials for the Yale News—and now\\nI was going to bring back all such things into my life and become\\nagain that most limited of all specialists, the \"well-rounded man.\"\\nThis isn\\'t just an epigram—life is much more successfully looked at\\nfrom a single window, after all.\\nIt was a matter of chance that I should have rented a house in one of\\nthe strangest communities in North America. It was on that slender\\nriotous island which extends itself due east of New York—and where\\nthere are, among other natural curiosities, two unusual formations of\\nland. Twenty miles from the city a pair of enormous eggs, identical in\\ncontour and separated only by a courtesy bay, jut out into the most\\ndomesticated body of salt water in the Western hemisphere, the great\\nwet barnyard of Long Island Sound. They are not perfect ovals—like the\\negg in the Columbus story, they are both crushed flat at the contact\\nend—but their physical resemblance must be a source of perpetual\\nwonder to the gulls that fly overhead. To the wingless a more\\ninteresting phenomenon is their dissimilarity in every particular\\nexcept shape and size.\\nI lived at West Egg, the—well, the less fashionable of the two, though\\nthis is a most superficial tag to express the bizarre and not a little\\nsinister contrast between them. My house was at the very tip of the\\negg, only fifty yards from the Sound, and squeezed between two huge\\nplaces that rented for twelve or fifteen thousand a season. The one on\\nmy right was a colossal affair by any standard—it was a factual\\nimitation of some Hôtel de Ville in Normandy, with a tower on one\\nside, spanking new under a thin beard of raw ivy, and a marble\\nswimming pool, and more than forty acres of lawn and garden. It was\\nGatsby\\'s mansion. Or, rather, as I didn\\'t know Mr. Gatsby, it was a\\nmansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. My own house was an\\neyesore, but it was a small eyesore, and it had been overlooked, so I\\nhad a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbour\\'s lawn, and\\nthe consoling proximity of millionaires—all for eighty dollars a\\nmonth.',\n",

His family were enormously wealthy—even in college his\\nfreedom with money was a matter for reproach—but now he'd left Chicago\\nand come East in a fashion that rather took your breath away: for\\ninstance, he'd brought down a string of polo ponies from Lake\\nForest. It was hard to realize that a man in my own generation was\\nwealthy enough to do that.\\nWhy they came East I don't know. They had spent a year in France for\\nno particular reason, and then drifted here and there unrestfully\\nwherever people played polo and were rich together. This was a\\npermanent move, said Daisy over the telephone, but I didn't believe\\nit—I had no sight into Daisy's heart, but I felt that Tom would drift\\non forever seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of\\nsome irrecoverable football game.\\nAnd so it happened that on a warm windy evening I drove over to East\\nEgg to see two old friends whom I scarcely knew at all. Their house\\nwas even more elaborate than I expected, a cheerful red-and-white\\nGeorgian Colonial mansion, overlooking the bay. The lawn started at\\nthe beach and ran towards the front door for a quarter of a mile,\\njumping over sundials and brick walks and burning gardens—finally when\\nit reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though\\nfrom the momentum of its run. The front was broken by a line of French\\nwindows, glowing now with reflected gold and wide open to the warm\\nwindy afternoon, and Tom Buchanan in riding clothes was standing with\\nhis legs apart on the front porch.\\nHe had changed since his New Haven years. Now he was a sturdy\\nstraw-haired man of thirty, with a rather hard mouth and a\\nsupercilious manner. Two shining arrogant eyes had established\\ndominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning\\naggressively forward. Not even the effeminate swank of his riding\\nclothes could hide the enormous power of that body—he seemed to fill\\nthose glistening boots until he strained the top lacing, and you could\\nsee a great pack of muscle shifting when his shoulder moved under his\\nthin coat. It was a body capable of enormous leverage—a cruel body.\\nHis speaking voice, a gruff husky tenor, added to the impression of\\nfractiousness he conveyed. There was a touch of paternal contempt in\\nit, even toward people he liked—and there were men at New Haven who\\nhad hated his guts.\",\n",

The\\nwindows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside\\nthat seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through\\nthe room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale\\nflags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding-cake of the\\nceiling, and then rippled over the wine-coloured rug, making a shadow\\non it as wind does on the sea.\\nThe only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous\\ncouch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an\\nanchored balloon. They were both in white, and their dresses were\\nrippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a\\nshort flight around the house. I must have stood for a few moments\\nlistening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a\\npicture on the wall. Then there was a boom as Tom Buchanan shut the\\nrear windows and the caught wind died out about the room, and the\\ncurtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the\\nfloor.\\nThe younger of the two was a stranger to me. She was extended full\\nlength at her end of the divan, completely motionless, and with her\\nchin raised a little, as if she were balancing something on it which\\nwas quite likely to fall. If she saw me out of the corner of her eyes\\nshe gave no hint of it—indeed, I was almost surprised into murmuring\\nan apology for having disturbed her by coming in.\\nThe other girl, Daisy, made an attempt to rise—she leaned slightly\\nforward with a conscientious expression—then she laughed, an absurd,\\ncharming little laugh, and I laughed too and came forward into the\\nroom.\\n\"I\\'m p-paralysed with happiness.\"\\nShe laughed again, as if she said something very witty, and held my\\nhand for a moment, looking up into my face, promising that there was\\nno one in the world she so much wanted to see. That was a way she\\nhad. She hinted in a murmur that the surname of the balancing girl was\\nBaker. (I\\'ve heard it said that Daisy\\'s murmur was only to make people\\nlean toward her; an irrelevant criticism that made it no less\\ncharming.)\\nAt any rate, Miss Baker\\'s lips fluttered, she nodded at me almost\\nimperceptibly, and then quickly tipped her head back again—the object',\n",

She was a slender, small-breasted girl, with\\nan erect carriage, which she accentuated by throwing her body backward\\nat the shoulders like a young cadet.

She snapped them out with her\\nfingers. \"In two weeks it\\'ll be the longest day in the year.\" She\\nlooked at us all radiantly. \"Do you always watch for the longest day\\nof the year and then miss it?

To a certain temperament the situation\\nmight have seemed intriguing—my own instinct was to telephone\\nimmediately for the police.\\nThe horses, needless to say, were not mentioned again. Tom and Miss\\nBaker, with several feet of twilight between them, strolled back into\\nthe library, as if to a vigil beside a perfectly tangible body, while,\\ntrying to look pleasantly interested and a little deaf, I followed\\nDaisy around a chain of connecting verandas to the porch in front. In\\nits deep gloom we sat down side by side on a wicker settee.\\nDaisy took her face in her hands as if feeling its lovely shape, and\\nher eyes moved gradually out into the velvet dusk. I saw that\\nturbulent emotions possessed her, so I asked what I thought would be\\nsome sedative questions about her little girl.\\n\"We don\\'t know each other very well, Nick,\" she said suddenly. \"Even\\nif we are cousins. You didn\\'t come to my wedding.\"\\n\"I wasn\\'t back from the war.\"\\n\"That\\'s true.\" She hesitated. \"Well, I\\'ve had a very bad time, Nick,\\nand I\\'m pretty cynical about everything.\"\\nEvidently she had reason to be. I waited but she didn\\'t say any more,\\nand after a moment I returned rather feebly to the subject of her\\ndaughter.\\n\"I suppose she talks, and—eats, and everything.\"\\n\"Oh, yes.\" She looked at me absently. \"Listen, Nick; let me tell you\\nwhat I said when she was born. Would you like to hear?\"\\n\"Very much.\"\\n\"It\\'ll show you how I\\'ve gotten to feel about—things. Well, she was\\nless than an hour old and Tom was God knows where. I woke up out of\\nthe ether with an utterly abandoned feeling, and asked the nurse right\\naway if it was a boy or a girl. She told me it was a girl, and so I\\nturned my head away and wept. \\'All right,\\' I said, \\'I\\'m glad it\\'s a\\ngirl. And I hope she\\'ll be a fool—that\\'s the best thing a girl can be\\nin this world, a beautiful little fool.\\'\\n\"You see I think everything\\'s terrible anyhow,\" she went on in a\\nconvinced way. \"Everybody thinks so—the most advanced people.

I\\'ve been everywhere and seen everything and done everything.\"\\nHer eyes flashed around her in a defiant way, rather like Tom\\'s, and\\nshe laughed with thrilling scorn. \"Sophisticated—God, I\\'m\\nsophisticated!\"\\nThe instant her voice broke off, ceasing to compel my attention, my\\nbelief, I felt the basic insincerity of what she had said. It made me\\nuneasy, as though the whole evening had been a trick of some sort to\\nexact a contributory emotion from me.

What kind do you want, lady?\"\\n\"I\\'d like to get one of those police dogs; I don\\'t suppose you got\\nthat kind?\"\\nThe man peered doubtfully into the basket, plunged in his hand and\\ndrew one up, wriggling, by the back of the neck.\\n\"That\\'s no police dog,\" said Tom.\\n\"No, it\\'s not exactly a police dog,\" said the man with disappointment\\nin his voice. \"It\\'s more of an Airedale.\" He passed his hand over the\\nbrown washrag of a back. \"Look at that coat. Some coat. That\\'s a dog\\nthat\\'ll never bother you with catching cold.\"\\n\"I think it\\'s cute,\" said Mrs. Wilson enthusiastically. \"How much is\\nit?\"\\n\"That dog?\" He looked at it admiringly. \"That dog will cost you ten\\ndollars.\"\\nThe Airedale—undoubtedly there was an Airedale concerned in it\\nsomewhere, though its feet were startlingly white—changed hands and\\nsettled down into Mrs. Wilson\\'s lap, where she fondled the\\nweatherproof coat with rapture.\\n\"Is it a boy or a girl?\" she asked delicately.\\n\"That dog? That dog\\'s a boy.\"\\n\"It\\'s a bitch,\" said Tom decisively. \"Here\\'s your money. Go and buy\\nten more dogs with it.\"',\n",

Her eyebrows had been plucked and then drawn on again at a more\\nrakish angle, but the efforts of nature toward the restoration of the\\nold alignment gave a blurred air to her face. When she moved about\\nthere was an incessant clicking as innumerable pottery bracelets\\njingled up and down upon her arms. She came in with such a proprietary\\nhaste, and looked around so possessively at the furniture that I\\nwondered if she lived here. But when I asked her she laughed\\nimmoderately, repeated my question aloud, and told me she lived with a\\ngirl friend at a hotel.\\nMr. McKee was a pale, feminine man from the flat below. He had just\\nshaved, for there was a white spot of lather on his cheekbone, and he\\nwas most respectful in his greeting to everyone in the room. He\\ninformed me that he was in the \"artistic game,\" and I gathered later\\nthat he was a photographer and had made the dim enlargement of\\nMrs. Wilson\\'s mother which hovered like an ectoplasm on the wall. His\\nwife was shrill, languid, handsome, and horrible. She told me with\\npride that her husband had photographed her a hundred and twenty-seven\\ntimes since they had been married.\\nMrs. Wilson had changed her costume some time before, and was now\\nattired in an elaborate afternoon dress of cream-coloured chiffon,\\nwhich gave out a continual rustle as she swept about the room. With\\nthe influence of the dress her personality had also undergone a\\nchange. The intense vitality that had been so remarkable in the garage\\nwas converted into impressive hauteur. Her laughter, her gestures, her\\nassertions became more violently affected moment by moment, and as she\\nexpanded the room grew smaller around her, until she seemed to be\\nrevolving on a noisy, creaking pivot through the smoky air.',\n",

God, how I hated that town!\"\\nThe late afternoon sky bloomed in the window for a moment like the\\nblue honey of the Mediterranean—then the shrill voice of Mrs. McKee\\ncalled me back into the room.\\n\"I almost made a mistake, too,\" she declared vigorously. \"I almost\\nmarried a little kike who\\'d been after me for years.

He borrowed somebody\\'s best suit to get married in, and\\nnever even told me about it, and the man came after it one day when he\\nwas out: \\'Oh, is that your suit?\\' I said. \\'This is the first I ever\\nheard about it.\\' But I gave it to him and then I lay down and cried to\\nbeat the band all afternoon.\"\\n\"She really ought to get away from him,\" resumed Catherine to me.\\n\"They\\'ve been living over that garage for eleven years.

I wanted to\\nget out and walk eastward toward the park through the soft twilight,\\nbut each time I tried to go I became entangled in some wild, strident\\nargument which pulled me back, as if with ropes, into my chair. Yet\\nhigh over the city our line of yellow windows must have contributed\\ntheir share of human secrecy to the casual watcher in the darkening\\nstreets, and I saw him too, looking up and wondering. I was within and\\nwithout, simultaneously enchanted and repelled by the inexhaustible\\nvariety of life.\\nMyrtle pulled her chair close to mine, and suddenly her warm breath\\npoured over me the story of her first meeting with Tom.\\n\"It was on the two little seats facing each other that are always the\\nlast ones left on the train. I was going up to New York to see my\\nsister and spend the night. He had on a dress suit and patent leather\\nshoes, and I couldn\\'t keep my eyes off him, but every time he looked\\nat me I had to pretend to be looking at the advertisement over his\\nhead. When we came into the station he was next to me, and his white\\nshirtfront pressed against my arm, and so I told him I\\'d have to call\\na policeman, but he knew I lied. I was so excited that when I got into\\na taxi with him I didn\\'t hardly know I wasn\\'t getting into a subway\\ntrain. All I kept thinking about, over and over, was \\'You can\\'t live\\nforever; you can\\'t live forever.\\'\\u200a\"\\nShe turned to Mrs. McKee and the room rang full of her artificial\\nlaughter.\\n\"My dear,\" she cried, \"I\\'m going to give you this dress as soon as I\\'m\\nthrough with it.

I got to write down a list so I won\\'t\\nforget all the things I got to do.\"\\nIt was nine o\\'clock—almost immediately afterward I looked at my watch\\nand found it was ten. Mr. McKee was asleep on a chair with his fists\\nclenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. Taking out\\nmy handkerchief I wiped from his cheek the spot of dried lather that\\nhad worried me all the afternoon.\\nThe little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes\\nthrough the smoke, and from time to time groaning faintly. People\\ndisappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost\\neach other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet\\naway. Some time toward midnight Tom Buchanan and Mrs. Wilson stood\\nface to face discussing, in impassioned voices, whether Mrs. Wilson\\nhad any right to mention Daisy\\'s name.\\n\"Daisy! Daisy! Daisy!\" shouted Mrs. Wilson. \"I\\'ll say it whenever I\\nwant to! Daisy! Dai—\"\\nMaking a short deft movement, Tom Buchanan broke her nose with his\\nopen hand.\\nThen there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women\\'s\\nvoices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of\\npain. Mr. McKee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward the\\ndoor. When he had gone halfway he turned around and stared at the\\nscene—his wife and Catherine scolding and consoling as they stumbled\\nhere and there among the crowded furniture with articles of aid, and\\nthe despairing figure on the couch, bleeding fluently, and trying to\\nspread a copy of Town Tattle over the tapestry scenes of\\nVersailles. Then Mr. McKee turned and continued on out the door.\\nTaking my hat from the chandelier, I followed.',\n",

At high tide in the\\nafternoon I watched his guests diving from the tower of his raft, or\\ntaking the sun on the hot sand of his beach while his two motorboats\\nslit the waters of the Sound, drawing aquaplanes over cataracts of\\nfoam. On weekends his Rolls-Royce became an omnibus, bearing parties\\nto and from the city between nine in the morning and long past\\nmidnight, while his station wagon scampered like a brisk yellow bug to\\nmeet all trains. And on Mondays eight servants, including an extra\\ngardener, toiled all day with mops and scrubbing-brushes and hammers\\nand garden-shears, repairing the ravages of the night before.\\nEvery Friday five crates of oranges and lemons arrived from a\\nfruiterer in New York—every Monday these same oranges and lemons left\\nhis back door in a pyramid of pulpless halves. There was a machine in\\nthe kitchen which could extract the juice of two hundred oranges in\\nhalf an hour if a little button was pressed two hundred times by a\\nbutler's thumb.\\nAt least once a fortnight a corps of caterers came down with several\\nhundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas\\ntree of Gatsby's enormous garden. On buffet tables, garnished with\\nglistening hors-d'oeuvre, spiced baked hams crowded against salads of\\nharlequin designs and pastry pigs and turkeys bewitched to a dark\\ngold. In the main hall a bar with a real brass rail was set up, and\\nstocked with gins and liquors and with cordials so long forgotten that\\nmost of his female guests were too young to know one from another.\\nBy seven o'clock the orchestra has arrived, no thin five-piece affair,\\nbut a whole pitful of oboes and trombones and saxophones and viols and\\ncornets and piccolos, and low and high drums. The last swimmers have\\ncome in from the beach now and are dressing upstairs; the cars from\\nNew York are parked five deep in the drive, and already the halls and\\nsalons and verandas are gaudy with primary colours, and hair bobbed in\\nstrange new ways, and shawls beyond the dreams of Castile. The bar is\\nin full swing, and floating rounds of cocktails permeate the garden\\noutside, until the air is alive with chatter and laughter, and casual\\ninnuendo and introductions forgotten on the spot, and enthusiastic\\nmeetings between women who never knew each other's names.\\nThe lights grow brighter as the earth lurches away from the sun, and\\nnow the orchestra is playing yellow cocktail music, and the opera of\\nvoices pitches a key higher. Laughter is easier minute by minute,\\nspilled with prodigality, tipped out at a cheerful word. The groups\\nchange more swiftly, swell with new arrivals, dissolve and form in the\\nsame breath; already there are wanderers, confident girls who weave\\nhere and there among the stouter and more stable, become for a sharp,\\njoyous moment the centre of a group, and then, excited with triumph,\\nglide on through the sea-change of faces and voices and colour under\\nthe constantly changing light.\",\n",

I noticed that she wore her\\nevening-dress, all her dresses, like sports clothes—there was a\\njauntiness about her movements as if she had first learned to walk\\nupon golf courses on clean, crisp mornings.\\nI was alone and it was almost two. For some time confused and\\nintriguing sounds had issued from a long, many-windowed room which\\noverhung the terrace. Eluding Jordan\\'s undergraduate, who was now\\nengaged in an obstetrical conversation with two chorus girls, and who\\nimplored me to join him, I went inside.\\nThe large room was full of people. One of the girls in yellow was\\nplaying the piano, and beside her stood a tall, red-haired young lady\\nfrom a famous chorus, engaged in song. She had drunk a quantity of\\nchampagne, and during the course of her song she had decided, ineptly,\\nthat everything was very, very sad—she was not only singing, she was\\nweeping too. Whenever there was a pause in the song she filled it with\\ngasping, broken sobs, and then took up the lyric again in a quavering\\nsoprano. The tears coursed down her cheeks—not freely, however, for\\nwhen they came into contact with her heavily beaded eyelashes they\\nassumed an inky colour, and pursued the rest of their way in slow\\nblack rivulets. A humorous suggestion was made that she sing the notes\\non her face, whereupon she threw up her hands, sank into a chair, and\\nwent off into a deep vinous sleep.\\n\"She had a fight with a man who says he\\'s her husband,\" explained a\\ngirl at my elbow.\\nI looked around. Most of the remaining women were now having fights\\nwith men said to be their husbands. Even Jordan\\'s party, the quartet\\nfrom East Egg, were rent asunder by dissension. One of the men was\\ntalking with curious intensity to a young actress, and his wife, after\\nattempting to laugh at the situation in a dignified and indifferent\\nway, broke down entirely and resorted to flank attacks—at intervals\\nshe appeared suddenly at his side like an angry diamond, and hissed:\\n\"You promised!\" into his ear.\\nThe reluctance to go home was not confined to wayward men. The hall\\nwas at present occupied by two deplorably sober men and their highly\\nindignant wives. The wives were sympathizing with each other in\\nslightly raised voices.\\n\"Whenever he sees I\\'m having a good time he wants to go home.\"\\n\"Never heard anything so selfish in my life.\"\\n\"We\\'re always the first ones to leave.\"\\n\"So are we.\"\\n\"Well, we\\'re almost the last tonight,\" said one of the men sheepishly.\\n\"The orchestra left half an hour ago.\"\\nIn spite of the wives\\' agreement that such malevolence was beyond\\ncredibility, the dispute ended in a short struggle, and both wives\\nwere lifted, kicking, into the night.\\nAs I waited for my hat in the hall the door of the library opened and\\nJordan Baker and Gatsby came out together. He was saying some last\\nword to her, but the eagerness in his manner tightened abruptly into\\nformality as several people approached him to say goodbye.\\nJordan\\'s party were calling impatiently to her from the porch, but she\\nlingered for a moment to shake hands.\\n\"I\\'ve just heard the most amazing thing,\" she whispered. \"How long\\nwere we in there?\"\\n\"Why, about an hour.\"\\n\"It was … simply amazing,\" she repeated abstractedly. \"But I swore I\\nwouldn\\'t tell it and here I am tantalizing you.\" She yawned gracefully\\nin my face. \"Please come and see me … Phone book … Under the name of\\nMrs. Sigourney Howard … My aunt …\" She was hurrying off as she\\ntalked—her brown hand waved a jaunty salute as she melted into her\\nparty at the door.',\n",

       "   'text': 'over. Fifty feet from the door a dozen headlights illuminated a\\nbizarre and tumultuous scene. In the ditch beside the road, right side\\nup, but violently shorn of one wheel, rested a new coupé which had\\nleft Gatsby\\'s drive not two minutes before. The sharp jut of a wall\\naccounted for the detachment of the wheel, which was now getting\\nconsiderable attention from half a dozen curious chauffeurs. However,\\nas they had left their cars blocking the road, a harsh, discordant din\\nfrom those in the rear had been audible for some time, and added to\\nthe already violent confusion of the scene.\\nA man in a long duster had dismounted from the wreck and now stood in\\nthe middle of the road, looking from the car to the tyre and from the\\ntyre to the observers in a pleasant, puzzled way.\\n\"See!\" he explained. \"It went in the ditch.\"\\nThe fact was infinitely astonishing to him, and I recognized first the\\nunusual quality of wonder, and then the man—it was the late patron of\\nGatsby\\'s library.\\n\"How\\'d it happen?\"\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\n\"I know nothing whatever about mechanics,\" he said decisively.\\n\"But how did it happen? Did you run into the wall?\"\\n\"Don\\'t ask me,\" said Owl Eyes, washing his hands of the whole\\nmatter. \"I know very little about driving—next to nothing. It\\nhappened, and that\\'s all I know.\"\\n\"Well, if you\\'re a poor driver you oughtn\\'t to try driving at night.\"\\n\"But I wasn\\'t even trying,\" he explained indignantly, \"I wasn\\'t even\\ntrying.\"\\nAn awed hush fell upon the bystanders.\\n\"Do you want to commit suicide?\"\\n\"You\\'re lucky it was just a wheel! A bad driver and not even trying!\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand,\" explained the criminal. \"I wasn\\'t driving.\\nThere\\'s another man in the car.\"\\nThe shock that followed this declaration found voice in a sustained\\n\"Ah-h-h!\" as the door of the coupé swung slowly open. The crowd—it was\\nnow a crowd—stepped back involuntarily, and when the door had opened\\nwide there was a ghostly pause. Then, very gradually, part by part, a\\npale, dangling individual stepped out of the wreck, pawing tentatively\\nat the ground with a large uncertain dancing shoe.\\nBlinded by the glare of the headlights and confused by the incessant\\ngroaning of the horns, the apparition stood swaying for a moment\\nbefore he perceived the man in the duster.\\n\"Wha\\'s matter?\" he inquired calmly. \"Did we run outa gas?\"\\n\"Look!\"\\nHalf a dozen fingers pointed at the amputated wheel—he stared at it\\nfor a moment, and then looked upward as though he suspected that it\\nhad dropped from the sky.\\n\"It came off,\" someone explained.\\nHe nodded.\\n\"At first I din\\' notice we\\'d stopped.\"\\nA pause. Then, taking a long breath and straightening his shoulders,\\nhe remarked in a determined voice:\\n\"Wonder\\'ff tell me where there\\'s a gas\\'line station?\"\\nAt least a dozen men, some of them a little better off than he was,\\nexplained to him that wheel and car were no longer joined by any\\nphysical bond.\\n\"Back out,\" he suggested after a moment. \"Put her in reverse.\"\\n\"But the wheel\\'s off!\"\\nHe hesitated.\\n\"No harm in trying,\" he said.\\nThe caterwauling horns had reached a crescendo and I turned away and\\ncut across the lawn toward home. I glanced back once. A wafer of a\\nmoon was shining over Gatsby\\'s house, making the night fine as before,\\nand surviving the laughter and the sound of his still glowing garden.\\nA sudden emptiness seemed to flow now from the windows and the great\\ndoors, endowing with complete isolation the figure of the host, who\\nstood on the porch, his hand up in a formal gesture of farewell.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Reading over what I have written so far, I see I have given the\\nimpression that the events of three nights several weeks apart were\\nall that absorbed me. On the contrary, they were merely casual events\\nin a crowded summer, and, until much later, they absorbed me\\ninfinitely less than my personal affairs.\\nMost of the time I worked. In the early morning the sun threw my\\nshadow westward as I hurried down the white chasms of lower New York\\nto the Probity Trust. I knew the other clerks and young bond-salesmen\\nby their first names, and lunched with them in dark, crowded\\nrestaurants on little pig sausages and mashed potatoes and coffee. I\\neven had a short affair with a girl who lived in Jersey City and\\nworked in the accounting department, but her brother began throwing\\nmean looks in my direction, so when she went on her vacation in July I\\nlet it blow quietly away.\\nI took dinner usually at the Yale Club—for some reason it was the\\ngloomiest event of my day—and then I went upstairs to the library and\\nstudied investments and securities for a conscientious hour. There\\nwere generally a few rioters around, but they never came into the\\nlibrary, so it was a good place to work. After that, if the night was\\nmellow, I strolled down Madison Avenue past the old Murray Hill Hotel,\\nand over 33rd Street to the Pennsylvania Station.\\nI began to like New York, the racy, adventurous feel of it at night,\\nand the satisfaction that the constant flicker of men and women and\\nmachines gives to the restless eye. I liked to walk up Fifth Avenue\\nand pick out romantic women from the crowd and imagine that in a few\\nminutes I was going to enter into their lives, and no one would ever\\nknow or disapprove. Sometimes, in my mind, I followed them to their\\napartments on the corners of hidden streets, and they turned and\\nsmiled back at me before they faded through a door into warm\\ndarkness. At the enchanted metropolitan twilight I felt a haunting\\nloneliness sometimes, and felt it in others—poor young clerks who\\nloitered in front of windows waiting until it was time for a solitary\\nrestaurant dinner—young clerks in the dusk, wasting the most poignant\\nmoments of night and life.\\nAgain at eight o\\'clock, when the dark lanes of the Forties were lined\\nfive deep with throbbing taxicabs, bound for the theatre district, I\\nfelt a sinking in my heart. Forms leaned together in the taxis as they\\nwaited, and voices sang, and there was laughter from unheard jokes,\\nand lighted cigarettes made unintelligible circles inside. Imagining\\nthat I, too, was hurrying towards gaiety and sharing their intimate\\nexcitement, I wished them well.\\nFor a while I lost sight of Jordan Baker, and then in midsummer I\\nfound her again. At first I was flattered to go places with her,\\nbecause she was a golf champion, and everyone knew her name. Then it\\nwas something more. I wasn\\'t actually in love, but I felt a sort of\\ntender curiosity. The bored haughty face that she turned to the world\\nconcealed something—most affectations conceal something eventually,\\neven though they don\\'t in the beginning—and one day I found what it\\nwas. When we were on a house-party together up in Warwick, she left a\\nborrowed car out in the rain with the top down, and then lied about\\nit—and suddenly I remembered the story about her that had eluded me\\nthat night at Daisy\\'s. At her first big golf tournament there was a\\nrow that nearly reached the newspapers—a suggestion that she had moved\\nher ball from a bad lie in the semifinal round. The thing approached\\nthe proportions of a scandal—then died away. A caddy retracted his\\nstatement, and the only other witness admitted that he might have been\\nmistaken. The incident and the name had remained together in my mind.\\nJordan Baker instinctively avoided clever, shrewd men, and now I saw\\nthat this was because she felt safer on a plane where any divergence\\nfrom a code would be thought impossible. She was incurably dishonest.\\nShe wasn\\'t able to endure being at a disadvantage and, given this\\nunwillingness, I suppose she had begun dealing in subterfuges when she\\nwas very young in order to keep that cool, insolent smile turned to\\nthe world and yet satisfy the demands of her hard, jaunty body.\\nIt made no difference to me. Dishonesty in a woman is a thing you\\nnever blame deeply—I was casually sorry, and then I forgot. It was on\\nthat same house-party that we had a curious conversation about driving\\na car. It started because she passed so close to some workmen that our\\nfender flicked a button on one man\\'s coat.\\n\"You\\'re a rotten driver,\" I protested. \"Either you ought to be more\\ncareful, or you oughtn\\'t to drive at all.\"\\n\"I am careful.\"\\n\"No, you\\'re not.\"\\n\"Well, other people are,\" she said lightly.\\n\"What\\'s that got to do with it?\"\\n\"They\\'ll keep out of my way,\" she insisted. \"It takes two to make an\\naccident.\"\\n\"Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.\"\\n\"I hope I never will,\" she answered. \"I hate careless people. That\\'s\\nwhy I like you.\"\\nHer grey, sun-strained eyes stared straight ahead, but she had\\ndeliberately shifted our relations, and for a moment I thought I loved\\nher. But I am slow-thinking and full of interior rules that act as\\nbrakes on my desires, and I knew that first I had to get myself\\ndefinitely out of that tangle back home. I\\'d been writing letters once\\na week and signing them: \"Love, Nick,\" and all I could think of was\\nhow, when that certain girl played tennis, a faint moustache of\\nperspiration appeared on her upper lip. Nevertheless there was a vague\\nunderstanding that had to be tactfully broken off before I was free.\\nEveryone suspects himself of at least one of the cardinal virtues, and\\nthis is mine: I am one of the few honest people that I have ever\\nknown.',\n",

Reach me a rose, honey, and pour me a last drop into that there\\ncrystal glass.\"\\nOnce I wrote down on the empty spaces of a timetable the names of\\nthose who came to Gatsby\\'s house that summer. It is an old timetable\\nnow, disintegrating at its folds, and headed \"This schedule in effect\\nJuly 5th, 1922.\" But I can still read the grey names, and they will\\ngive you a better impression than my generalities of those who\\naccepted Gatsby\\'s hospitality and paid him the subtle tribute of\\nknowing nothing whatever about him.\\nFrom East Egg, then, came the Chester Beckers and the Leeches, and a\\nman named Bunsen, whom I knew at Yale, and Doctor Webster Civet, who\\nwas drowned last summer up in Maine. And the Hornbeams and the Willie\\nVoltaires, and a whole clan named Blackbuck, who always gathered in a\\ncorner and flipped up their noses like goats at whosoever came\\nnear. And the Ismays and the Chrysties (or rather Hubert Auerbach and\\nMr. Chrystie\\'s wife), and Edgar Beaver, whose hair, they say, turned\\ncotton-white one winter afternoon for no good reason at all.\\nClarence Endive was from East Egg, as I remember. He came only once,\\nin white knickerbockers, and had a fight with a bum named Etty in the\\ngarden. From farther out on the Island came the Cheadles and the O.\\nR. P. Schraeders, and the Stonewall Jackson Abrams of Georgia, and the\\nFishguards and the Ripley Snells. Snell was there three days before he\\nwent to the penitentiary, so drunk out on the gravel drive that\\nMrs. Ulysses Swett\\'s automobile ran over his right hand. The Dancies\\ncame, too, and S. B. Whitebait, who was well over sixty, and Maurice\\nA. Flink, and the Hammerheads, and Beluga the tobacco importer, and\\nBeluga\\'s girls.\\nFrom West Egg came the Poles and the Mulreadys and Cecil Roebuck and\\nCecil Schoen and Gulick the State senator and Newton Orchid, who\\ncontrolled Films Par Excellence, and Eckhaust and Clyde Cohen and Don\\nS. Schwartz (the son) and Arthur McCarty, all connected with the\\nmovies in one way or another. And the Catlips and the Bembergs and G.\\nEarl Muldoon, brother to that Muldoon who afterward strangled his\\nwife. Da Fontano the promoter came there, and Ed Legros and James B.\\n(\"Rot-Gut\") Ferret and the De Jongs and Ernest Lilly—they came to\\ngamble, and when Ferret wandered into the garden it meant he was\\ncleaned out and Associated Traction would have to fluctuate profitably\\nnext day.\\nA man named Klipspringer was there so often that he became known as\\n\"the boarder\"—I doubt if he had any other home. Of theatrical people\\nthere were Gus Waize and Horace O\\'Donavan and Lester Myer and George\\nDuckweed and Francis Bull. Also from New York were the Chromes and the\\nBackhyssons and the Dennickers and Russel Betty and the Corrigans and\\nthe Kellehers and the Dewars and the Scullys and S. W. Belcher and the\\nSmirkes and the young Quinns, divorced now, and Henry L. Palmetto, who\\nkilled himself by jumping in front of a subway train in Times Square.\\nBenny McClenahan arrived always with four girls. They were never quite\\nthe same ones in physical person, but they were so identical one with\\nanother that it inevitably seemed they had been there before. I have\\nforgotten their names—Jaqueline, I think, or else Consuela, or Gloria\\nor Judy or June, and their last names were either the melodious names\\nof flowers and months or the sterner ones of the great American\\ncapitalists whose cousins, if pressed, they would confess themselves\\nto be.\\nIn addition to all these I can remember that Faustina O\\'Brien came\\nthere at least once and the Baedeker girls and young Brewer, who had\\nhis nose shot off in the war, and Mr. Albrucksburger and Miss Haag,\\nhis fiancée, and Ardita Fitz-Peters and Mr. P. Jewett, once head of\\nthe American Legion, and Miss Claudia Hip, with a man reputed to be\\nher chauffeur, and a prince of something, whom we called Duke, and\\nwhose name, if I ever knew it, I have forgotten.\\nAll these people came to Gatsby\\'s house in the summer.',\n",

       "   'text': 'At nine o\\'clock, one morning late in July, Gatsby\\'s gorgeous car\\nlurched up the rocky drive to my door and gave out a burst of melody\\nfrom its three-noted horn.\\nIt was the first time he had called on me, though I had gone to two of\\nhis parties, mounted in his hydroplane, and, at his urgent invitation,\\nmade frequent use of his beach.\\n\"Good morning, old sport. You\\'re having lunch with me today and I\\nthought we\\'d ride up together.\"\\nHe was balancing himself on the dashboard of his car with that\\nresourcefulness of movement that is so peculiarly American—that comes,\\nI suppose, with the absence of lifting work in youth and, even more,\\nwith the formless grace of our nervous, sporadic games. This quality\\nwas continually breaking through his punctilious manner in the shape\\nof restlessness. He was never quite still; there was always a tapping\\nfoot somewhere or the impatient opening and closing of a hand.\\nHe saw me looking with admiration at his car.\\n\"It\\'s pretty, isn\\'t it, old sport?\" He jumped off to give me a better\\nview. \"Haven\\'t you ever seen it before?\"\\nI\\'d seen it. Everybody had seen it. It was a rich cream colour, bright\\nwith nickel, swollen here and there in its monstrous length with\\ntriumphant hatboxes and supper-boxes and toolboxes, and terraced with\\na labyrinth of windshields that mirrored a dozen suns. Sitting down\\nbehind many layers of glass in a sort of green leather conservatory,\\nwe started to town.\\nI had talked with him perhaps half a dozen times in the past month and\\nfound, to my disappointment, that he had little to say. So my first\\nimpression, that he was a person of some undefined consequence, had\\ngradually faded and he had become simply the proprietor of an\\nelaborate roadhouse next door.\\nAnd then came that disconcerting ride. We hadn\\'t reached West Egg\\nvillage before Gatsby began leaving his elegant sentences unfinished\\nand slapping himself indecisively on the knee of his caramel-coloured\\nsuit.\\n\"Look here, old sport,\" he broke out surprisingly, \"what\\'s your\\nopinion of me, anyhow?\"\\nA little overwhelmed, I began the generalized evasions which that\\nquestion deserves.\\n\"Well, I\\'m going to tell you something about my life,\" he interrupted.\\n\"I don\\'t want you to get a wrong idea of me from all these stories you\\nhear.\"\\nSo he was aware of the bizarre accusations that flavoured conversation\\nin his halls.\\n\"I\\'ll tell you God\\'s truth.\" His right hand suddenly ordered divine\\nretribution to stand by. \"I am the son of some wealthy people in the\\nMiddle West—all dead now. I was brought up in America but educated at\\nOxford, because all my ancestors have been educated there for many\\nyears. It is a family tradition.\"\\nHe looked at me sideways—and I knew why Jordan Baker had believed he\\nwas lying. He hurried the phrase \"educated at Oxford,\" or swallowed\\nit, or choked on it, as though it had bothered him before. And with\\nthis doubt, his whole statement fell to pieces, and I wondered if\\nthere wasn\\'t something a little sinister about him, after all.\\n\"What part of the Middle West?\" I inquired casually.\\n\"San Francisco.\"\\n\"I see.\"\\n\"My family all died and I came into a good deal of money.\"\\nHis voice was solemn, as if the memory of that sudden extinction of a\\nclan still haunted him. For a moment I suspected that he was pulling\\nmy leg, but a glance at him convinced me otherwise.\\n\"After that I lived like a young rajah in all the capitals of\\nEurope—Paris, Venice, Rome—collecting jewels, chiefly rubies, hunting\\nbig game, painting a little, things for myself only, and trying to\\nforget something very sad that had happened to me long ago.\"\\nWith an effort I managed to restrain my incredulous laughter. The very\\nphrases were worn so threadbare that they evoked no image except that\\nof a turbaned \"character\" leaking sawdust at every pore as he pursued\\na tiger through the Bois de Boulogne.\\n\"Then came the war, old sport. It was a great relief, and I tried very\\nhard to die, but I seemed to bear an enchanted life. I accepted a\\ncommission as first lieutenant when it began. In the Argonne Forest I\\ntook the remains of my machine-gun battalion so far forward that there\\nwas a half mile gap on either side of us where the infantry couldn\\'t\\nadvance. We stayed there two days and two nights, a hundred and thirty\\nmen with sixteen Lewis guns, and when the infantry came up at last\\nthey found the insignia of three German divisions among the piles of\\ndead. I was promoted to be a major, and every Allied government gave\\nme a decoration—even Montenegro, little Montenegro down on the\\nAdriatic Sea!\"\\nLittle Montenegro! He lifted up the words and nodded at them—with his\\nsmile. The smile comprehended Montenegro\\'s troubled history and\\nsympathized with the brave struggles of the Montenegrin people. It\\nappreciated fully the chain of national circumstances which had\\nelicited this tribute from Montenegro\\'s warm little heart. My\\nincredulity was submerged in fascination now; it was like skimming\\nhastily through a dozen magazines.\\nHe reached in his pocket, and a piece of metal, slung on a ribbon,\\nfell into my palm.\\n\"That\\'s the one from Montenegro.\"\\nTo my astonishment, the thing had an authentic look. \"Orderi di\\nDanilo,\" ran the circular legend, \"Montenegro, Nicolas Rex.\"\\n\"Turn it.\"\\n\"Major Jay Gatsby,\" I read, \"For Valour Extraordinary.\"\\n\"Here\\'s another thing I always carry. A souvenir of Oxford days. It\\nwas taken in Trinity Quad—the man on my left is now the Earl of\\nDoncaster.\"\\nIt was a photograph of half a dozen young men in blazers loafing in an\\narchway through which were visible a host of spires. There was Gatsby,\\nlooking a little, not much, younger—with a cricket bat in his hand.\\nThen it was all true. I saw the skins of tigers flaming in his palace\\non the Grand Canal; I saw him opening a chest of rubies to ease, with\\ntheir crimson-lighted depths, the gnawings of his broken heart.\\n\"I\\'m going to make a big request of you today,\" he said, pocketing his\\nsouvenirs with satisfaction, \"so I thought you ought to know something\\nabout me.

       "   'text': 'Roaring noon. In a well-fanned Forty-second Street cellar I met Gatsby\\nfor lunch. Blinking away the brightness of the street outside, my eyes\\npicked him out obscurely in the anteroom, talking to another man.\\n\"Mr. Carraway, this is my friend Mr. Wolfshiem.\"\\nA small, flat-nosed Jew raised his large head and regarded me with two\\nfine growths of hair which luxuriated in either nostril. After a\\nmoment I discovered his tiny eyes in the half-darkness.\\n\"—So I took one look at him,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, shaking my hand\\nearnestly, \"and what do you think I did?\"\\n\"What?\" I inquired politely.\\nBut evidently he was not addressing me, for he dropped my hand and\\ncovered Gatsby with his expressive nose.\\n\"I handed the money to Katspaugh and I said: \\'All right, Katspaugh,\\ndon\\'t pay him a penny till he shuts his mouth.\\' He shut it then and\\nthere.\"\\nGatsby took an arm of each of us and moved forward into the\\nrestaurant, whereupon Mr. Wolfshiem swallowed a new sentence he was\\nstarting and lapsed into a somnambulatory abstraction.\\n\"Highballs?\" asked the head waiter.\\n\"This is a nice restaurant here,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, looking at the\\npresbyterian nymphs on the ceiling. \"But I like across the street\\nbetter!\"\\n\"Yes, highballs,\" agreed Gatsby, and then to Mr. Wolfshiem: \"It\\'s too\\nhot over there.\"\\n\"Hot and small—yes,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, \"but full of memories.\"\\n\"What place is that?\" I asked.\\n\"The old Metropole.\"\\n\"The old Metropole,\" brooded Mr. Wolfshiem gloomily. \"Filled with\\nfaces dead and gone. Filled with friends gone now forever. I can\\'t\\nforget so long as I live the night they shot Rosy Rosenthal there. It\\nwas six of us at the table, and Rosy had eat and drunk a lot all\\nevening. When it was almost morning the waiter came up to him with a\\nfunny look and says somebody wants to speak to him outside. \\'All\\nright,\\' says Rosy, and begins to get up, and I pulled him down in his\\nchair.\\n\"\\u200a\\'Let the bastards come in here if they want you, Rosy, but don\\'t\\nyou, so help me, move outside this room.\\'\\n\"It was four o\\'clock in the morning then, and if we\\'d of raised the\\nblinds we\\'d of seen daylight.\"\\n\"Did he go?\" I asked innocently.\\n\"Sure he went.\" Mr. Wolfshiem\\'s nose flashed at me indignantly. \"He\\nturned around in the door and says: \\'Don\\'t let that waiter take away\\nmy coffee!\\' Then he went out on the sidewalk, and they shot him three\\ntimes in his full belly and drove away.\"\\n\"Four of them were electrocuted,\" I said, remembering.\\n\"Five, with Becker.\" His nostrils turned to me in an interested way.\\n\"I understand you\\'re looking for a business gonnegtion.\"\\nThe juxtaposition of these two remarks was startling. Gatsby answered\\nfor me:\\n\"Oh, no,\" he exclaimed, \"this isn\\'t the man.\"\\n\"No?\" Mr. Wolfshiem seemed disappointed.\\n\"This is just a friend. I told you we\\'d talk about that some other\\ntime.\"\\n\"I beg your pardon,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, \"I had a wrong man.\"\\nA succulent hash arrived, and Mr. Wolfshiem, forgetting the more\\nsentimental atmosphere of the old Metropole, began to eat with\\nferocious delicacy. His eyes, meanwhile, roved very slowly all around\\nthe room—he completed the arc by turning to inspect the people\\ndirectly behind. I think that, except for my presence, he would have\\ntaken one short glance beneath our own table.\\n\"Look here, old sport,\" said Gatsby, leaning toward me, \"I\\'m afraid I\\nmade you a little angry this morning in the car.\"\\nThere was the smile again, but this time I held out against it.\\n\"I don\\'t like mysteries,\" I answered, \"and I don\\'t understand why you\\nwon\\'t come out frankly and tell me what you want. Why has it all got\\nto come through Miss Baker?\"\\n\"Oh, it\\'s nothing underhand,\" he assured me. \"Miss Baker\\'s a great\\nsportswoman, you know, and she\\'d never do anything that wasn\\'t all\\nright.\"\\nSuddenly he looked at his watch, jumped up, and hurried from the room,\\nleaving me with Mr. Wolfshiem at the table.\\n\"He has to telephone,\" said Mr. Wolfshiem, following him with his\\neyes. \"Fine fellow, isn\\'t he? Handsome to look at and a perfect\\ngentleman.\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"He\\'s an Oggsford man.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\"He went to Oggsford College in England. You know Oggsford College?\"\\n\"I\\'ve heard of it.\"\\n\"It\\'s one of the most famous colleges in the world.\"\\n\"Have you known Gatsby for a long time?\" I inquired.\\n\"Several years,\" he answered in a gratified way. \"I made the pleasure\\nof his acquaintance just after the war. But I knew I had discovered a\\nman of fine breeding after I talked with him an hour. I said to\\nmyself: \\'There\\'s the kind of man you\\'d like to take home and introduce\\nto your mother and sister.\\'\\u200a\" He paused. \"I see you\\'re looking at my\\ncuff buttons.\"\\nI hadn\\'t been looking at them, but I did now. They were composed of\\noddly familiar pieces of ivory.\\n\"Finest specimens of human molars,\" he informed me.\\n\"Well!\" I inspected them. \"That\\'s a very interesting idea.\"\\n\"Yeah.\" He flipped his sleeves up under his coat. \"Yeah, Gatsby\\'s very\\ncareful about women. He would never so much as look at a friend\\'s\\nwife.\"\\nWhen the subject of this instinctive trust returned to the table and\\nsat down Mr. Wolfshiem drank his coffee with a jerk and got to his\\nfeet.\\n\"I have enjoyed my lunch,\" he said, \"and I\\'m going to run off from you\\ntwo young men before I outstay my welcome.\"\\n\"Don\\'t hurry Meyer,\" said Gatsby, without enthusiasm. Mr. Wolfshiem\\nraised his hand in a sort of benediction.\\n\"You\\'re very polite, but I belong to another generation,\" he announced\\nsolemnly. \"You sit here and discuss your sports and your young ladies\\nand your—\" He supplied an imaginary noun with another wave of his\\nhand. \"As for me, I am fifty years old, and I won\\'t impose myself on\\nyou any longer.\"\\nAs he shook hands and turned away his tragic nose was trembling. I\\nwondered if I had said anything to offend him.\\n\"He becomes very sentimental sometimes,\" explained Gatsby. \"This is\\none of his sentimental days. He\\'s quite a character around New York—a\\ndenizen of Broadway.\"\\n\"Who is he, anyhow, an actor?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"A dentist?\"\\n\"Meyer Wolfshiem? No, he\\'s a gambler.\" Gatsby hesitated, then added,\\ncoolly: \"He\\'s the man who fixed the World\\'s Series back in 1919.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'One October day in nineteen-seventeen—\\n(said Jordan Baker that afternoon, sitting up very straight on a\\nstraight chair in the tea-garden at the Plaza Hotel)\\n—I was walking along from one place to another, half on the sidewalks\\nand half on the lawns. I was happier on the lawns because I had on\\nshoes from England with rubber knobs on the soles that bit into the\\nsoft ground. I had on a new plaid skirt also that blew a little in the\\nwind, and whenever this happened the red, white, and blue banners in\\nfront of all the houses stretched out stiff and said tut-tut-tut-tut,\\nin a disapproving way.\\nThe largest of the banners and the largest of the lawns belonged to\\nDaisy Fay\\'s house. She was just eighteen, two years older than me, and\\nby far the most popular of all the young girls in Louisville. She\\ndressed in white, and had a little white roadster, and all day long\\nthe telephone rang in her house and excited young officers from Camp\\nTaylor demanded the privilege of monopolizing her that\\nnight. \"Anyways, for an hour!\"\\nWhen I came opposite her house that morning her white roadster was\\nbeside the kerb, and she was sitting in it with a lieutenant I had\\nnever seen before. They were so engrossed in each other that she\\ndidn\\'t see me until I was five feet away.\\n\"Hello, Jordan,\" she called unexpectedly. \"Please come here.\"\\nI was flattered that she wanted to speak to me, because of all the\\nolder girls I admired her most. She asked me if I was going to the Red\\nCross to make bandages. I was. Well, then, would I tell them that she\\ncouldn\\'t come that day? The officer looked at Daisy while she was\\nspeaking, in a way that every young girl wants to be looked at\\nsometime, and because it seemed romantic to me I have remembered the\\nincident ever since. His name was Jay Gatsby, and I didn\\'t lay eyes on\\nhim again for over four years—even after I\\'d met him on Long Island I\\ndidn\\'t realize it was the same man.\\nThat was nineteen-seventeen. By the next year I had a few beaux\\nmyself, and I began to play in tournaments, so I didn\\'t see Daisy very\\noften. She went with a slightly older crowd—when she went with anyone\\nat all. Wild rumours were circulating about her—how her mother had\\nfound her packing her bag one winter night to go to New York and say\\ngoodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. She was effectually\\nprevented, but she wasn\\'t on speaking terms with her family for\\nseveral weeks. After that she didn\\'t play around with the soldiers any\\nmore, but only with a few flat-footed, shortsighted young men in town,\\nwho couldn\\'t get into the army at all.\\nBy the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. She had a début\\nafter the armistice, and in February she was presumably engaged to a\\nman from New Orleans. In June she married Tom Buchanan of Chicago,\\nwith more pomp and circumstance than Louisville ever knew before. He\\ncame down with a hundred people in four private cars, and hired a\\nwhole floor of the Muhlbach Hotel, and the day before the wedding he\\ngave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand\\ndollars.\\nI was a bridesmaid. I came into her room half an hour before the\\nbridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the June\\nnight in her flowered dress—and as drunk as a monkey. She had a bottle\\nof Sauterne in one hand and a letter in the other.\\n\"\\u200a\\'Gratulate me,\" she muttered. \"Never had a drink before, but oh how\\nI do enjoy it.\"\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Daisy?\"\\nI was scared, I can tell you; I\\'d never seen a girl like that before.\\n\"Here, dearies.\" She groped around in a wastebasket she had with her\\non the bed and pulled out the string of pearls. \"Take \\'em downstairs\\nand give \\'em back to whoever they belong to. Tell \\'em all Daisy\\'s\\nchange\\' her mine. Say: \\'Daisy\\'s change\\' her mine!\\'\\u200a\"\\nShe began to cry—she cried and cried. I rushed out and found her\\nmother\\'s maid, and we locked the door and got her into a cold bath.\\nShe wouldn\\'t let go of the letter. She took it into the tub with her\\nand squeezed it up in a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the\\nsoap-dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.\\nBut she didn\\'t say another word. We gave her spirits of ammonia and\\nput ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress, and half\\nan hour later, when we walked out of the room, the pearls were around\\nher neck and the incident was over. Next day at five o\\'clock she\\nmarried Tom Buchanan without so much as a shiver, and started off on a\\nthree months\\' trip to the South Seas.\\nI saw them in Santa Barbara when they came back, and I thought I\\'d\\nnever seen a girl so mad about her husband. If he left the room for a\\nminute she\\'d look around uneasily, and say: \"Where\\'s Tom gone?\" and\\nwear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the\\ndoor. She used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the\\nhour, rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with\\nunfathomable delight. It was touching to see them together—it made you\\nlaugh in a hushed, fascinated way. That was in August. A week after I\\nleft Santa Barbara Tom ran into a wagon on the Ventura road one night,\\nand ripped a front wheel off his car. The girl who was with him got\\ninto the papers, too, because her arm was broken—she was one of the\\nchambermaids in the Santa Barbara Hotel.\\nThe next April Daisy had her little girl, and they went to France for\\na year. I saw them one spring in Cannes, and later in Deauville, and\\nthen they came back to Chicago to settle down. Daisy was popular in\\nChicago, as you know. They moved with a fast crowd, all of them young\\nand rich and wild, but she came out with an absolutely perfect\\nreputation. Perhaps because she doesn\\'t drink. It\\'s a great advantage\\nnot to drink among hard-drinking people. You can hold your tongue and,\\nmoreover, you can time any little irregularity of your own so that\\neverybody else is so blind that they don\\'t see or care. Perhaps Daisy\\nnever went in for amour at all—and yet there\\'s something in that voice\\nof hers …\\nWell, about six weeks ago, she heard the name Gatsby for the first\\ntime in years. It was when I asked you—do you remember?—if you knew\\nGatsby in West Egg. After you had gone home she came into my room and\\nwoke me up, and said: \"What Gatsby?\" and when I described him—I was\\nhalf asleep—she said in the strangest voice that it must be the man\\nshe used to know. It wasn\\'t until then that I connected this Gatsby\\nwith the officer in her white car.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWhen Jordan Baker had finished telling all this we had left the Plaza\\nfor half an hour and were driving in a victoria through Central Park.\\nThe sun had gone down behind the tall apartments of the movie stars in\\nthe West Fifties, and the clear voices of children, already gathered\\nlike crickets on the grass, rose through the hot twilight:\\n\"I\\'m the Sheik of Araby. Your love belongs to me. At night when\\nyou\\'re asleep Into your tent I\\'ll creep—\"\\n\"It was a strange coincidence,\" I said.\\n\"But it wasn\\'t a coincidence at all.\"\\n\"Why not?\"\\n\"Gatsby bought that house so that Daisy would be just across the bay.\"\\nThen it had not been merely the stars to which he had aspired on that\\nJune night. He came alive to me, delivered suddenly from the womb of\\nhis purposeless splendour.\\n\"He wants to know,\" continued Jordan, \"if you\\'ll invite Daisy to your\\nhouse some afternoon and then let him come over.\"\\nThe modesty of the demand shook me. He had waited five years and\\nbought a mansion where he dispensed starlight to casual moths—so that\\nhe could \"come over\" some afternoon to a stranger\\'s garden.\\n\"Did I have to know all this before he could ask such a little thing?\"\\n\"He\\'s afraid, he\\'s waited so long. He thought you might be\\noffended. You see, he\\'s regular tough underneath it all.\"\\nSomething worried me.\\n\"Why didn\\'t he ask you to arrange a meeting?\"\\n\"He wants her to see his house,\" she explained. \"And your house is\\nright next door.\"\\n\"Oh!\"\\n\"I think he half expected her to wander into one of his parties, some\\nnight,\" went on Jordan, \"but she never did. Then he began asking\\npeople casually if they knew her, and I was the first one he found. It\\nwas that night he sent for me at his dance, and you should have heard\\nthe elaborate way he worked up to it. Of course, I immediately\\nsuggested a luncheon in New York—and I thought he\\'d go mad:\\n\"\\u200a\\'I don\\'t want to do anything out of the way!\\' he kept saying. \\'I\\nwant to see her right next door.\\'\\n\"When I said you were a particular friend of Tom\\'s, he started to\\nabandon the whole idea. He doesn\\'t know very much about Tom, though he\\nsays he\\'s read a Chicago paper for years just on the chance of\\ncatching a glimpse of Daisy\\'s name.\"\\nIt was dark now, and as we dipped under a little bridge I put my arm\\naround Jordan\\'s golden shoulder and drew her toward me and asked her\\nto dinner. Suddenly I wasn\\'t thinking of Daisy and Gatsby any more,\\nbut of this clean, hard, limited person, who dealt in universal\\nscepticism, and who leaned back jauntily just within the circle of my\\narm. A phrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady\\nexcitement: \"There are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy, and\\nthe tired.\"\\n\"And Daisy ought to have something in her life,\" murmured Jordan to\\nme.\\n\"Does she want to see Gatsby?\"\\n\"She\\'s not to know about it. Gatsby doesn\\'t want her to know. You\\'re\\njust supposed to invite her to tea.\"',\n",

       "   'text': 'When I came home to West Egg that night I was afraid for a moment that\\nmy house was on fire. Two o\\'clock and the whole corner of the\\npeninsula was blazing with light, which fell unreal on the shrubbery\\nand made thin elongating glints upon the roadside wires. Turning a\\ncorner, I saw that it was Gatsby\\'s house, lit from tower to cellar.\\nAt first I thought it was another party, a wild rout that had resolved\\nitself into \"hide-and-go-seek\" or \"sardines-in-the-box\" with all the\\nhouse thrown open to the game. But there wasn\\'t a sound. Only wind in\\nthe trees, which blew the wires and made the lights go off and on\\nagain as if the house had winked into the darkness. As my taxi groaned\\naway I saw Gatsby walking toward me across his lawn.\\n\"Your place looks like the World\\'s Fair,\" I said.\\n\"Does it?\" He turned his eyes toward it absently. \"I have been\\nglancing into some of the rooms. Let\\'s go to Coney Island, old\\nsport. In my car.\"\\n\"It\\'s too late.\"\\n\"Well, suppose we take a plunge in the swimming pool? I haven\\'t made\\nuse of it all summer.\"\\n\"I\\'ve got to go to bed.\"\\n\"All right.\"\\nHe waited, looking at me with suppressed eagerness.\\n\"I talked with Miss Baker,\" I said after a moment. \"I\\'m going to call\\nup Daisy tomorrow and invite her over here to tea.\"\\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" he said carelessly. \"I don\\'t want to put you\\nto any trouble.\"\\n\"What day would suit you?\"\\n\"What day would suit you?\" he corrected me quickly. \"I don\\'t want to\\nput you to any trouble, you see.\"\\n\"How about the day after tomorrow?\"\\nHe considered for a moment. Then, with reluctance: \"I want to get the\\ngrass cut,\" he said.\\nWe both looked down at the grass—there was a sharp line where my\\nragged lawn ended and the darker, well-kept expanse of his began. I\\nsuspected that he meant my grass.\\n\"There\\'s another little thing,\" he said uncertainly, and hesitated.\\n\"Would you rather put it off for a few days?\" I asked.\\n\"Oh, it isn\\'t about that. At least—\" He fumbled with a series of\\nbeginnings. \"Why, I thought—why, look here, old sport, you don\\'t make\\nmuch money, do you?\"\\n\"Not very much.\"\\nThis seemed to reassure him and he continued more confidently.\\n\"I thought you didn\\'t, if you\\'ll pardon my—you see, I carry on a\\nlittle business on the side, a sort of side line, you understand. And\\nI thought that if you don\\'t make very much—You\\'re selling bonds,\\naren\\'t you, old sport?\"\\n\"Trying to.\"\\n\"Well, this would interest you. It wouldn\\'t take up much of your time\\nand you might pick up a nice bit of money. It happens to be a rather\\nconfidential sort of thing.\"\\nI realize now that under different circumstances that conversation\\nmight have been one of the crises of my life. But, because the offer\\nwas obviously and tactlessly for a service to be rendered, I had no\\nchoice except to cut him off there.\\n\"I\\'ve got my hands full,\" I said. \"I\\'m much obliged but I couldn\\'t\\ntake on any more work.\"\\n\"You wouldn\\'t have to do any business with Wolfshiem.\" Evidently he\\nthought that I was shying away from the \"gonnegtion\" mentioned at\\nlunch, but I assured him he was wrong. He waited a moment longer,\\nhoping I\\'d begin a conversation, but I was too absorbed to be\\nresponsive, so he went unwillingly home.',\n",

At eleven o\\'clock a man in a\\nraincoat, dragging a lawn-mower, tapped at my front door and said that\\nMr. Gatsby had sent him over to cut my grass. This reminded me that I\\nhad forgotten to tell my Finn to come back, so I drove into West Egg\\nVillage to search for her among soggy whitewashed alleys and to buy\\nsome cups and lemons and flowers.\\nThe flowers were unnecessary, for at two o\\'clock a greenhouse arrived\\nfrom Gatsby\\'s, with innumerable receptacles to contain it. An hour\\nlater the front door opened nervously, and Gatsby in a white flannel\\nsuit, silver shirt, and gold-coloured tie, hurried in. He was pale,\\nand there were dark signs of sleeplessness beneath his eyes.\\n\"Is everything all right?\" he asked immediately.\\n\"The grass looks fine, if that\\'s what you mean.\"\\n\"What grass?\" he inquired blankly. \"Oh, the grass in the yard.\" He\\nlooked out the window at it, but, judging from his expression, I don\\'t\\nbelieve he saw a thing.\\n\"Looks very good,\" he remarked vaguely. \"One of the papers said they\\nthought the rain would stop about four.

       "   'text': 'nervous circuit of the house half an hour before—and ran for a huge\\nblack knotted tree, whose massed leaves made a fabric against the\\nrain. Once more it was pouring, and my irregular lawn, well-shaved by\\nGatsby\\'s gardener, abounded in small muddy swamps and prehistoric\\nmarshes. There was nothing to look at from under the tree except\\nGatsby\\'s enormous house, so I stared at it, like Kant at his church\\nsteeple, for half an hour. A brewer had built it early in the \"period\"\\ncraze, a decade before, and there was a story that he\\'d agreed to pay\\nfive years\\' taxes on all the neighbouring cottages if the owners would\\nhave their roofs thatched with straw. Perhaps their refusal took the\\nheart out of his plan to Found a Family—he went into an immediate\\ndecline. His children sold his house with the black wreath still on\\nthe door. Americans, while willing, even eager, to be serfs, have\\nalways been obstinate about being peasantry.\\nAfter half an hour, the sun shone again, and the grocer\\'s automobile\\nrounded Gatsby\\'s drive with the raw material for his servants\\'\\ndinner—I felt sure he wouldn\\'t eat a spoonful. A maid began opening\\nthe upper windows of his house, appeared momentarily in each, and,\\nleaning from the large central bay, spat meditatively into the\\ngarden. It was time I went back. While the rain continued it had\\nseemed like the murmur of their voices, rising and swelling a little\\nnow and then with gusts of emotion. But in the new silence I felt that\\nsilence had fallen within the house too.\\nI went in—after making every possible noise in the kitchen, short of\\npushing over the stove—but I don\\'t believe they heard a sound. They\\nwere sitting at either end of the couch, looking at each other as if\\nsome question had been asked, or was in the air, and every vestige of\\nembarrassment was gone. Daisy\\'s face was smeared with tears, and when\\nI came in she jumped up and began wiping at it with her handkerchief\\nbefore a mirror. But there was a change in Gatsby that was simply\\nconfounding. He literally glowed; without a word or a gesture of\\nexultation a new well-being radiated from him and filled the little\\nroom.\\n\"Oh, hello, old sport,\" he said, as if he hadn\\'t seen me for years. I\\nthought for a moment he was going to shake hands.\\n\"It\\'s stopped raining.\"\\n\"Has it?\" When he realized what I was talking about, that there were\\ntwinkle-bells of sunshine in the room, he smiled like a weather man,\\nlike an ecstatic patron of recurrent light, and repeated the news to\\nDaisy. \"What do you think of that? It\\'s stopped raining.\"\\n\"I\\'m glad, Jay.\" Her throat, full of aching, grieving beauty, told\\nonly of her unexpected joy.\\n\"I want you and Daisy to come over to my house,\" he said, \"I\\'d like to\\nshow her around.\"\\n\"You\\'re sure you want me to come?\"\\n\"Absolutely, old sport.\"\\nDaisy went upstairs to wash her face—too late I thought with\\nhumiliation of my towels—while Gatsby and I waited on the lawn.\\n\"My house looks well, doesn\\'t it?\" he demanded. \"See how the whole\\nfront of it catches the light.\"\\nI agreed that it was splendid.\\n\"Yes.\" His eyes went over it, every arched door and square tower. \"It\\ntook me just three years to earn the money that bought it.\"\\n\"I thought you inherited your money.\"\\n\"I did, old sport,\" he said automatically, \"but I lost most of it in\\nthe big panic—the panic of the war.\"\\nI think he hardly knew what he was saying, for when I asked him what\\nbusiness he was in he answered: \"That\\'s my affair,\" before he realized\\nthat it wasn\\'t an appropriate reply.\\n\"Oh, I\\'ve been in several things,\" he corrected himself. \"I was in the\\ndrug business and then I was in the oil business. But I\\'m not in\\neither one now.\" He looked at me with more attention. \"Do you mean\\nyou\\'ve been thinking over what I proposed the other night?\"\\nBefore I could answer, Daisy came out of the house and two rows of\\nbrass buttons on her dress gleamed in the sunlight.\\n\"That huge place there?\" she cried pointing.\\n\"Do you like it?\"\\n\"I love it, but I don\\'t see how you live there all alone.\"\\n\"I keep it always full of interesting people, night and day. People\\nwho do interesting things. Celebrated people.\"\\nInstead of taking the shortcut along the Sound we went down to the\\nroad and entered by the big postern. With enchanting murmurs Daisy\\nadmired this aspect or that of the feudal silhouette against the sky,\\nadmired the gardens, the sparkling odour of jonquils and the frothy\\nodour of hawthorn and plum blossoms and the pale gold odour of\\nkiss-me-at-the-gate. It was strange to reach the marble steps and find\\nno stir of bright dresses in and out the door, and hear no sound but\\nbird voices in the trees.\\nAnd inside, as we wandered through Marie Antoinette music-rooms and\\nRestoration Salons, I felt that there were guests concealed behind\\nevery couch and table, under orders to be breathlessly silent until we\\nhad passed through. As Gatsby closed the door of \"the Merton College\\nLibrary\" I could have sworn I heard the owl-eyed man break into\\nghostly laughter.',\n",

       "   'text': 'We went upstairs, through period bedrooms swathed in rose and lavender\\nsilk and vivid with new flowers, through dressing-rooms and poolrooms,\\nand bathrooms with sunken baths—intruding into one chamber where a\\ndishevelled man in pyjamas was doing liver exercises on the floor. It\\nwas Mr. Klipspringer, the \"boarder.\" I had seen him wandering hungrily\\nabout the beach that morning. Finally we came to Gatsby\\'s own\\napartment, a bedroom and a bath, and an Adam\\'s study, where we sat\\ndown and drank a glass of some Chartreuse he took from a cupboard in\\nthe wall.\\nHe hadn\\'t once ceased looking at Daisy, and I think he revalued\\neverything in his house according to the measure of response it drew\\nfrom her well-loved eyes. Sometimes too, he stared around at his\\npossessions in a dazed way, as though in her actual and astounding\\npresence none of it was any longer real. Once he nearly toppled down a\\nflight of stairs.\\nHis bedroom was the simplest room of all—except where the dresser was\\ngarnished with a toilet set of pure dull gold. Daisy took the brush\\nwith delight, and smoothed her hair, whereupon Gatsby sat down and\\nshaded his eyes and began to laugh.\\n\"It\\'s the funniest thing, old sport,\" he said hilariously. \"I\\ncan\\'t—When I try to—\"\\nHe had passed visibly through two states and was entering upon a\\nthird. After his embarrassment and his unreasoning joy he was consumed\\nwith wonder at her presence. He had been full of the idea so long,\\ndreamed it right through to the end, waited with his teeth set, so to\\nspeak, at an inconceivable pitch of intensity. Now, in the reaction,\\nhe was running down like an over-wound clock.\\nRecovering himself in a minute he opened for us two hulking patent\\ncabinets which held his massed suits and dressing-gowns and ties, and\\nhis shirts, piled like bricks in stacks a dozen high.\\n\"I\\'ve got a man in England who buys me clothes. He sends over a\\nselection of things at the beginning of each season, spring and fall.\"\\nHe took out a pile of shirts and began throwing them, one by one,\\nbefore us, shirts of sheer linen and thick silk and fine flannel,\\nwhich lost their folds as they fell and covered the table in\\nmany-coloured disarray. While we admired he brought more and the soft\\nrich heap mounted higher—shirts with stripes and scrolls and plaids in\\ncoral and apple-green and lavender and faint orange, with monograms of\\nindian blue. Suddenly, with a strained sound, Daisy bent her head into\\nthe shirts and began to cry stormily.\\n\"They\\'re such beautiful shirts,\" she sobbed, her voice muffled in the\\nthick folds. \"It makes me sad because I\\'ve never seen such—such\\nbeautiful shirts before.\"',\n",

His life had been confused and disordered since then,\\nbut if he could once return to a certain starting place and go over it\\nall slowly, he could find out what that thing was …\\n… One autumn night, five years before, they had been walking down the\\nstreet when the leaves were falling, and they came to a place where\\nthere were no trees and the sidewalk was white with moonlight. They\\nstopped here and turned toward each other. Now it was a cool night\\nwith that mysterious excitement in it which comes at the two changes\\nof the year. The quiet lights in the houses were humming out into the\\ndarkness and there was a stir and bustle among the stars. Out of the\\ncorner of his eye Gatsby saw that the blocks of the sidewalks really\\nformed a ladder and mounted to a secret place above the trees—he could\\nclimb to it, if he climbed alone, and once there he could suck on the\\npap of life, gulp down the incomparable milk of wonder.\\nHis heart beat faster as Daisy's white face came up to his own. He\\nknew that when he kissed this girl, and forever wed his unutterable\\nvisions to her perishable breath, his mind would never romp again like\\nthe mind of God. So he waited, listening for a moment longer to the\\ntuning-fork that had been struck upon a star. Then he kissed her. At\\nhis lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the\\nincarnation was complete.\\nThrough all he said, even through his appalling sentimentality, I was\\nreminded of something—an elusive rhythm, a fragment of lost words,\\nthat I had heard somewhere a long time ago. For a moment a phrase\\ntried to take shape in my mouth and my lips parted like a dumb man's,\\nas though there was more struggling upon them than a wisp of startled\\nair.

As my train emerged from the tunnel into sunlight, only\\nthe hot whistles of the National Biscuit Company broke the simmering\\nhush at noon. The straw seats of the car hovered on the edge of\\ncombustion; the woman next to me perspired delicately for a while into\\nher white shirtwaist, and then, as her newspaper dampened under her\\nfingers, lapsed despairingly into deep heat with a desolate cry. Her\\npocketbook slapped to the floor.\\n\"Oh, my!\" she gasped.\\nI picked it up with a weary bend and handed it back to her, holding it\\nat arm\\'s length and by the extreme tip of the corners to indicate that\\nI had no designs upon it—but everyone near by, including the woman,\\nsuspected me just the same.\\n\"Hot!\" said the conductor to familiar faces. \"Some weather! … Hot! …\\nHot! … Hot! … Is it hot enough for you? Is it hot? Is it …\\u200a?\"\\nMy commutation ticket came back to me with a dark stain from his hand.\\nThat anyone should care in this heat whose flushed lips he kissed,\\nwhose head made damp the pyjama pocket over his heart!\\n… Through the hall of the Buchanans\\' house blew a faint wind, carrying\\nthe sound of the telephone bell out to Gatsby and me as we waited at\\nthe door.\\n\"The master\\'s body?\" roared the butler into the mouthpiece. \"I\\'m\\nsorry, madame, but we can\\'t furnish it—it\\'s far too hot to touch this\\nnoon!\"\\nWhat he really said was: \"Yes … Yes … I\\'ll see.\"\\nHe set down the receiver and came toward us, glistening slightly, to\\ntake our stiff straw hats.\\n\"Madame expects you in the salon!\" he cried, needlessly indicating the\\ndirection. In this heat every extra gesture was an affront to the\\ncommon store of life.\\nThe room, shadowed well with awnings, was dark and cool. Daisy and\\nJordan lay upon an enormous couch, like silver idols weighing down\\ntheir own white dresses against the singing breeze of the fans.\\n\"We can\\'t move,\" they said together.\\nJordan\\'s fingers, powdered white over their tan, rested for a moment\\nin mine.\\n\"And Mr. Thomas Buchanan, the athlete?\" I inquired.\\nSimultaneously I heard his voice, gruff, muffled, husky, at the hall\\ntelephone.\\nGatsby stood in the centre of the crimson carpet and gazed around with\\nfascinated eyes. Daisy watched him and laughed, her sweet, exciting\\nlaugh; a tiny gust of powder rose from her bosom into the air.\\n\"The rumour is,\" whispered Jordan, \"that that\\'s Tom\\'s girl on the\\ntelephone.\"\\nWe were silent. The voice in the hall rose high with annoyance: \"Very\\nwell, then, I won\\'t sell you the car at all … I\\'m under no obligations\\nto you at all … and as for your bothering me about it at lunch time, I\\nwon\\'t stand that at all!\"\\n\"Holding down the receiver,\" said Daisy cynically.\\n\"No, he\\'s not,\" I assured her. \"It\\'s a bona-fide deal. I happen to\\nknow about it.\"\\nTom flung open the door, blocked out its space for a moment with his\\nthick body, and hurried into the room.\\n\"Mr. Gatsby!\" He put out his broad, flat hand with well-concealed\\ndislike. \"I\\'m glad to see you, sir … Nick …\"\\n\"Make us a cold drink,\" cried Daisy.\\nAs he left the room again she got up and went over to Gatsby and\\npulled his face down, kissing him on the mouth.\\n\"You know I love you,\" she murmured.\\n\"You forget there\\'s a lady present,\" said Jordan.\\nDaisy looked around doubtfully.\\n\"You kiss Nick too.\"\\n\"What a low, vulgar girl!\"\\n\"I don\\'t care!\" cried Daisy, and began to clog on the brick fireplace.\\nThen she remembered the heat and sat down guiltily on the couch just\\nas a freshly laundered nurse leading a little girl came into the room.\\n\"Bles-sed pre-cious,\" she crooned, holding out her arms. \"Come to your\\nown mother that loves you.\"\\nThe child, relinquished by the nurse, rushed across the room and\\nrooted shyly into her mother\\'s dress.\\n\"The bles-sed pre-cious! Did mother get powder on your old yellowy\\nhair? Stand up now, and say—How-de-do.\"\\nGatsby and I in turn leaned down and took the small reluctant hand.\\nAfterward he kept looking at the child with surprise. I don\\'t think he\\nhad ever really believed in its existence before.\\n\"I got dressed before luncheon,\" said the child, turning eagerly to\\nDaisy.\\n\"That\\'s because your mother wanted to show you off.\" Her face bent\\ninto the single wrinkle of the small white neck. \"You dream, you. You\\nabsolute little dream.\"\\n\"Yes,\" admitted the child calmly. \"Aunt Jordan\\'s got on a white dress\\ntoo.\"\\n\"How do you like mother\\'s friends?\" Daisy turned her around so that\\nshe faced Gatsby. \"Do you think they\\'re pretty?\"\\n\"Where\\'s Daddy?\"\\n\"She doesn\\'t look like her father,\" explained Daisy. \"She looks like\\nme. She\\'s got my hair and shape of the face.\"\\nDaisy sat back upon the couch. The nurse took a step forward and held\\nout her hand.\\n\"Come, Pammy.\"\\n\"Goodbye, sweetheart!\"\\nWith a reluctant backward glance the well-disciplined child held to\\nher nurse\\'s hand and was pulled out the door, just as Tom came back,\\npreceding four gin rickeys that clicked full of ice.\\nGatsby took up his drink.\\n\"They certainly look cool,\" he said, with visible tension.\\nWe drank in long, greedy swallows.\\n\"I read somewhere that the sun\\'s getting hotter every year,\" said Tom\\ngenially. \"It seems that pretty soon the earth\\'s going to fall into\\nthe sun—or wait a minute—it\\'s just the opposite—the sun\\'s getting\\ncolder every year.\\n\"Come outside,\" he suggested to Gatsby, \"I\\'d like you to have a look\\nat the place.\"\\nI went with them out to the veranda.

It was full of money—that\\nwas the inexhaustible charm that rose and fell in it, the jingle of\\nit, the cymbals\\' song of it … High in a white palace the king\\'s\\ndaughter, the golden girl …\\nTom came out of the house wrapping a quart bottle in a towel, followed\\nby Daisy and Jordan wearing small tight hats of metallic cloth and\\ncarrying light capes over their arms.\\n\"Shall we all go in my car?\" suggested Gatsby. He felt the hot, green\\nleather of the seat. \"I ought to have left it in the shade.\"\\n\"Is it standard shift?\" demanded Tom.\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"Well, you take my coupé and let me drive your car to town.\"\\nThe suggestion was distasteful to Gatsby.\\n\"I don\\'t think there\\'s much gas,\" he objected.\\n\"Plenty of gas,\" said Tom boisterously. He looked at the gauge. \"And\\nif it runs out I can stop at a drugstore. You can buy anything at a\\ndrugstore nowadays.\"\\nA pause followed this apparently pointless remark. Daisy looked at Tom\\nfrowning, and an indefinable expression, at once definitely unfamiliar\\nand vaguely recognizable, as if I had only heard it described in\\nwords, passed over Gatsby\\'s face.\\n\"Come on, Daisy,\" said Tom, pressing her with his hand toward Gatsby\\'s\\ncar. \"I\\'ll take you in this circus wagon.\"\\nHe opened the door, but she moved out from the circle of his arm.\\n\"You take Nick and Jordan. We\\'ll follow you in the coupé.\"\\nShe walked close to Gatsby, touching his coat with her hand. Jordan\\nand Tom and I got into the front seat of Gatsby\\'s car, Tom pushed the\\nunfamiliar gears tentatively, and we shot off into the oppressive\\nheat, leaving them out of sight behind.',\n",

       "   'text': '\"I\\'ve made a small investigation of this fellow,\" he continued. \"I\\ncould have gone deeper if I\\'d known—\"\\n\"Do you mean you\\'ve been to a medium?\" inquired Jordan humorously.\\n\"What?\" Confused, he stared at us as we laughed. \"A medium?\"\\n\"About Gatsby.\"\\n\"About Gatsby! No, I haven\\'t. I said I\\'d been making a small\\ninvestigation of his past.\"\\n\"And you found he was an Oxford man,\" said Jordan helpfully.\\n\"An Oxford man!\" He was incredulous. \"Like hell he is! He wears a pink\\nsuit.\"\\n\"Nevertheless he\\'s an Oxford man.\"\\n\"Oxford, New Mexico,\" snorted Tom contemptuously, \"or something like\\nthat.\"\\n\"Listen, Tom. If you\\'re such a snob, why did you invite him to lunch?\"\\ndemanded Jordan crossly.\\n\"Daisy invited him; she knew him before we were married—God knows\\nwhere!\"\\nWe were all irritable now with the fading ale, and aware of it we\\ndrove for a while in silence. Then as Doctor T. J. Eckleburg\\'s faded\\neyes came into sight down the road, I remembered Gatsby\\'s caution\\nabout gasoline.\\n\"We\\'ve got enough to get us to town,\" said Tom.\\n\"But there\\'s a garage right here,\" objected Jordan. \"I don\\'t want to\\nget stalled in this baking heat.\"\\nTom threw on both brakes impatiently, and we slid to an abrupt dusty\\nstop under Wilson\\'s sign. After a moment the proprietor emerged from\\nthe interior of his establishment and gazed hollow-eyed at the car.\\n\"Let\\'s have some gas!\" cried Tom roughly. \"What do you think we\\nstopped for—to admire the view?\"\\n\"I\\'m sick,\" said Wilson without moving. \"Been sick all day.\"\\n\"What\\'s the matter?\"\\n\"I\\'m all run down.\"\\n\"Well, shall I help myself?\" Tom demanded. \"You sounded well enough on\\nthe phone.\"\\nWith an effort Wilson left the shade and support of the doorway and,\\nbreathing hard, unscrewed the cap of the tank. In the sunlight his\\nface was green.\\n\"I didn\\'t mean to interrupt your lunch,\" he said. \"But I need money\\npretty bad, and I was wondering what you were going to do with your\\nold car.\"\\n\"How do you like this one?\" inquired Tom. \"I bought it last week.\"\\n\"It\\'s a nice yellow one,\" said Wilson, as he strained at the handle.\\n\"Like to buy it?\"\\n\"Big chance,\" Wilson smiled faintly. \"No, but I could make some money\\non the other.\"\\n\"What do you want money for, all of a sudden?\"\\n\"I\\'ve been here too long. I want to get away. My wife and I want to go\\nWest.\"\\n\"Your wife does,\" exclaimed Tom, startled.\\n\"She\\'s been talking about it for ten years.\" He rested for a moment\\nagainst the pump, shading his eyes. \"And now she\\'s going whether she\\nwants to or not. I\\'m going to get her away.\"\\nThe coupé flashed by us with a flurry of dust and the flash of a\\nwaving hand.\\n\"What do I owe you?\" demanded Tom harshly.\\n\"I just got wised up to something funny the last two days,\" remarked\\nWilson. \"That\\'s why I want to get away. That\\'s why I been bothering\\nyou about the car.\"\\n\"What do I owe you?\"\\n\"Dollar twenty.\"\\nThe relentless beating heat was beginning to confuse me and I had a\\nbad moment there before I realized that so far his suspicions hadn\\'t\\nalighted on Tom. He had discovered that Myrtle had some sort of life\\napart from him in another world, and the shock had made him physically\\nsick. I stared at him and then at Tom, who had made a parallel\\ndiscovery less than an hour before—and it occurred to me that there\\nwas no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as\\nthe difference between the sick and the well. Wilson was so sick that\\nhe looked guilty, unforgivably guilty—as if he had just got some poor\\ngirl with child.\\n\"I\\'ll let you have that car,\" said Tom. \"I\\'ll send it over tomorrow\\nafternoon.\"\\nThat locality was always vaguely disquieting, even in the broad glare\\nof afternoon, and now I turned my head as though I had been warned of\\nsomething behind. Over the ash-heaps the giant eyes of Doctor T. J.\\nEckleburg kept their vigil, but I perceived, after a moment, that\\nother eyes were regarding us with peculiar intensity from less than\\ntwenty feet away.\\nIn one of the windows over the garage the curtains had been moved\\naside a little, and Myrtle Wilson was peering down at the car. So\\nengrossed was she that she had no consciousness of being observed, and\\none emotion after another crept into her face like objects into a\\nslowly developing picture. Her expression was curiously familiar—it\\nwas an expression I had often seen on women\\'s faces, but on Myrtle\\nWilson\\'s face it seemed purposeless and inexplicable until I realized\\nthat her eyes, wide with jealous terror, were fixed not on Tom, but on\\nJordan Baker, whom she took to be his wife.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThere is no confusion like the confusion of a simple mind, and as we\\ndrove away Tom was feeling the hot whips of panic. His wife and his\\nmistress, until an hour ago secure and inviolate, were slipping\\nprecipitately from his control. Instinct made him step on the\\naccelerator with the double purpose of overtaking Daisy and leaving\\nWilson behind, and we sped along toward Astoria at fifty miles an\\nhour, until, among the spidery girders of the elevated, we came in\\nsight of the easygoing blue coupé.\\n\"Those big movies around Fiftieth Street are cool,\" suggested\\nJordan. \"I love New York on summer afternoons when everyone\\'s away.\\nThere\\'s something very sensuous about it—overripe, as if all sorts of\\nfunny fruits were going to fall into your hands.\"\\nThe word \"sensuous\" had the effect of further disquieting Tom, but\\nbefore he could invent a protest the coupé came to a stop, and Daisy\\nsignalled us to draw up alongside.\\n\"Where are we going?\" she cried.\\n\"How about the movies?\"\\n\"It\\'s so hot,\" she complained. \"You go. We\\'ll ride around and meet you\\nafter.\" With an effort her wit rose faintly. \"We\\'ll meet you on some\\ncorner. I\\'ll be the man smoking two cigarettes.\"\\n\"We can\\'t argue about it here,\" Tom said impatiently, as a truck gave\\nout a cursing whistle behind us. \"You follow me to the south side of\\nCentral Park, in front of the Plaza.\"\\nSeveral times he turned his head and looked back for their car, and if\\nthe traffic delayed them he slowed up until they came into sight. I\\nthink he was afraid they would dart down a side-street and out of his\\nlife forever.\\nBut they didn\\'t. And we all took the less explicable step of engaging\\nthe parlour of a suite in the Plaza Hotel.\\nThe prolonged and tumultuous argument that ended by herding us into\\nthat room eludes me, though I have a sharp physical memory that, in\\nthe course of it, my underwear kept climbing like a damp snake around\\nmy legs and intermittent beads of sweat raced cool across my back.\\nThe notion originated with Daisy\\'s suggestion that we hire five\\nbathrooms and take cold baths, and then assumed more tangible form as\\n\"a place to have a mint julep.\" Each of us said over and over that it\\nwas a \"crazy idea\"—we all talked at once to a baffled clerk and\\nthought, or pretended to think, that we were being very funny …\\nThe room was large and stifling, and, though it was already four\\no\\'clock, opening the windows admitted only a gust of hot shrubbery\\nfrom the Park. Daisy went to the mirror and stood with her back to us,\\nfixing her hair.\\n\"It\\'s a swell suite,\" whispered Jordan respectfully, and everyone\\nlaughed.\\n\"Open another window,\" commanded Daisy, without turning around.\\n\"There aren\\'t any more.\"\\n\"Well, we\\'d better telephone for an axe—\"\\n\"The thing to do is to forget about the heat,\" said Tom impatiently.\\n\"You make it ten times worse by crabbing about it.\"\\nHe unrolled the bottle of whisky from the towel and put it on the\\ntable.\\n\"Why not let her alone, old sport?\" remarked Gatsby. \"You\\'re the one\\nthat wanted to come to town.\"\\nThere was a moment of silence. The telephone book slipped from its\\nnail and splashed to the floor, whereupon Jordan whispered, \"Excuse\\nme\"—but this time no one laughed.\\n\"I\\'ll pick it up,\" I offered.\\n\"I\\'ve got it.\" Gatsby examined the parted string, muttered \"Hum!\" in\\nan interested way, and tossed the book on a chair.\\n\"That\\'s a great expression of yours, isn\\'t it?\" said Tom sharply.\\n\"What is?\"\\n\"All this \\'old sport\\' business. Where\\'d you pick that up?\"\\n\"Now see here, Tom,\" said Daisy, turning around from the mirror, \"if\\nyou\\'re going to make personal remarks I won\\'t stay here a minute.\\nCall up and order some ice for the mint julep.\"\\nAs Tom took up the receiver the compressed heat exploded into sound\\nand we were listening to the portentous chords of Mendelssohn\\'s\\nWedding March from the ballroom below.\\n\"Imagine marrying anybody in this heat!\" cried Jordan dismally.\\n\"Still—I was married in the middle of June,\" Daisy remembered.\\n\"Louisville in June! Somebody fainted. Who was it fainted, Tom?\"\\n\"Biloxi,\" he answered shortly.\\n\"A man named Biloxi. \\'Blocks\\' Biloxi, and he made boxes—that\\'s a\\nfact—and he was from Biloxi, Tennessee.\"\\n\"They carried him into my house,\" appended Jordan, \"because we lived\\njust two doors from the church. And he stayed three weeks, until Daddy\\ntold him he had to get out. The day after he left Daddy died.\" After\\na moment she added as if she might have sounded irreverent, \"There\\nwasn\\'t any connection.\"\\n\"I used to know a Bill Biloxi from Memphis,\" I remarked.\\n\"That was his cousin. I knew his whole family history before he\\nleft. He gave me an aluminium putter that I use today.\"\\nThe music had died down as the ceremony began and now a long cheer\\nfloated in at the window, followed by intermittent cries of\\n\"Yea—ea—ea!\" and finally by a burst of jazz as the dancing began.\\n\"We\\'re getting old,\" said Daisy. \"If we were young we\\'d rise and\\ndance.\"\\n\"Remember Biloxi,\" Jordan warned her. \"Where\\'d you know him, Tom?\"\\n\"Biloxi?\" He concentrated with an effort. \"I didn\\'t know him. He was a\\nfriend of Daisy\\'s.\"\\n\"He was not,\" she denied. \"I\\'d never seen him before. He came down in\\nthe private car.\"\\n\"Well, he said he knew you. He said he was raised in Louisville. Asa\\nBird brought him around at the last minute and asked if we had room\\nfor him.\"\\nJordan smiled.\\n\"He was probably bumming his way home. He told me he was president of\\nyour class at Yale.\"\\nTom and I looked at each other blankly.\\n\"Biloxi?\"\\n\"First place, we didn\\'t have any president—\"\\nGatsby\\'s foot beat a short, restless tattoo and Tom eyed him suddenly.\\n\"By the way, Mr. Gatsby, I understand you\\'re an Oxford man.\"\\n\"Not exactly.\"\\n\"Oh, yes, I understand you went to Oxford.\"\\n\"Yes—I went there.\"\\nA pause. Then Tom\\'s voice, incredulous and insulting:\\n\"You must have gone there about the time Biloxi went to New Haven.\"\\nAnother pause. A waiter knocked and came in with crushed mint and ice\\nbut the silence was unbroken by his \"thank you\" and the soft closing\\nof the door. This tremendous detail was to be cleared up at last.\\n\"I told you I went there,\" said Gatsby.\\n\"I heard you, but I\\'d like to know when.\"\\n\"It was in nineteen-nineteen, I only stayed five months. That\\'s why I\\ncan\\'t really call myself an Oxford man.\"\\nTom glanced around to see if we mirrored his unbelief. But we were all\\nlooking at Gatsby.\\n\"It was an opportunity they gave to some of the officers after the\\narmistice,\" he continued. \"We could go to any of the universities in\\nEngland or France.\"\\nI wanted to get up and slap him on the back. I had one of those\\nrenewals of complete faith in him that I\\'d experienced before.\\nDaisy rose, smiling faintly, and went to the table.\\n\"Open the whisky, Tom,\" she ordered, \"and I\\'ll make you a mint julep.\\nThen you won\\'t seem so stupid to yourself … Look at the mint!\"\\n\"Wait a minute,\" snapped Tom, \"I want to ask Mr. Gatsby one more\\nquestion.\"\\n\"Go on,\" Gatsby said politely.\\n\"What kind of a row are you trying to cause in my house anyhow?\"\\nThey were out in the open at last and Gatsby was content.\\n\"He isn\\'t causing a row,\" Daisy looked desperately from one to the\\nother. \"You\\'re causing a row. Please have a little self-control.\"\\n\"Self-control!\" repeated Tom incredulously. \"I suppose the latest\\nthing is to sit back and let Mr. Nobody from Nowhere make love to your\\nwife. Well, if that\\'s the idea you can count me out … Nowadays people\\nbegin by sneering at family life and family institutions, and next\\nthey\\'ll throw everything overboard and have intermarriage between\\nblack and white.\"\\nFlushed with his impassioned gibberish, he saw himself standing alone\\non the last barrier of civilization.\\n\"We\\'re all white here,\" murmured Jordan.\\n\"I know I\\'m not very popular. I don\\'t give big parties. I suppose\\nyou\\'ve got to make your house into a pigsty in order to have any\\nfriends—in the modern world.\"\\nAngry as I was, as we all were, I was tempted to laugh whenever he\\nopened his mouth. The transition from libertine to prig was so\\ncomplete.\\n\"I\\'ve got something to tell you, old sport—\" began Gatsby. But Daisy\\nguessed at his intention.\\n\"Please don\\'t!\" she interrupted helplessly. \"Please let\\'s all go\\nhome. Why don\\'t we all go home?\"\\n\"That\\'s a good idea,\" I got up. \"Come on, Tom. Nobody wants a drink.\"\\n\"I want to know what Mr. Gatsby has to tell me.\"\\n\"Your wife doesn\\'t love you,\" said Gatsby. \"She\\'s never loved you.\\nShe loves me.\"\\n\"You must be crazy!\" exclaimed Tom automatically.\\nGatsby sprang to his feet, vivid with excitement.\\n\"She never loved you, do you hear?\" he cried. \"She only married you\\nbecause I was poor and she was tired of waiting for me. It was a\\nterrible mistake, but in her heart she never loved anyone except me!\"\\nAt this point Jordan and I tried to go, but Tom and Gatsby insisted\\nwith competitive firmness that we remain—as though neither of them had\\nanything to conceal and it would be a privilege to partake vicariously\\nof their emotions.\\n\"Sit down, Daisy,\" Tom\\'s voice groped unsuccessfully for the paternal\\nnote. \"What\\'s been going on? I want to hear all about it.\"\\n\"I told you what\\'s been going on,\" said Gatsby. \"Going on for five\\nyears—and you didn\\'t know.\"\\nTom turned to Daisy sharply.\\n\"You\\'ve been seeing this fellow for five years?\"\\n\"Not seeing,\" said Gatsby. \"No, we couldn\\'t meet. But both of us loved\\neach other all that time, old sport, and you didn\\'t know. I used to\\nlaugh sometimes\"—but there was no laughter in his eyes—\"to think that\\nyou didn\\'t know.\"\\n\"Oh—that\\'s all.\" Tom tapped his thick fingers together like a\\nclergyman and leaned back in his chair.\\n\"You\\'re crazy!\" he exploded. \"I can\\'t speak about what happened five\\nyears ago, because I didn\\'t know Daisy then—and I\\'ll be damned if I\\nsee how you got within a mile of her unless you brought the groceries\\nto the back door. But all the rest of that\\'s a God damned lie. Daisy\\nloved me when she married me and she loves me now.\"\\n\"No,\" said Gatsby, shaking his head.\\n\"She does, though. The trouble is that sometimes she gets foolish\\nideas in her head and doesn\\'t know what she\\'s doing.\" He nodded\\nsagely. \"And what\\'s more, I love Daisy too. Once in a while I go off\\non a spree and make a fool of myself, but I always come back, and in\\nmy heart I love her all the time.\"\\n\"You\\'re revolting,\" said Daisy. She turned to me, and her voice,\\ndropping an octave lower, filled the room with thrilling scorn: \"Do\\nyou know why we left Chicago? I\\'m surprised that they didn\\'t treat you\\nto the story of that little spree.\"\\nGatsby walked over and stood beside her.\\n\"Daisy, that\\'s all over now,\" he said earnestly. \"It doesn\\'t matter\\nany more. Just tell him the truth—that you never loved him—and it\\'s\\nall wiped out forever.\"\\nShe looked at him blindly. \"Why—how could I love him—possibly?\"\\n\"You never loved him.\"\\nShe hesitated. Her eyes fell on Jordan and me with a sort of appeal,\\nas though she realized at last what she was doing—and as though she\\nhad never, all along, intended doing anything at all. But it was done\\nnow. It was too late.\\n\"I never loved him,\" she said, with perceptible reluctance.\\n\"Not at Kapiolani?\" demanded Tom suddenly.\\n\"No.\"\\nFrom the ballroom beneath, muffled and suffocating chords were\\ndrifting up on hot waves of air.\\n\"Not that day I carried you down from the Punch Bowl to keep your\\nshoes dry?\" There was a husky tenderness in his tone … \"Daisy?\"\\n\"Please don\\'t.\" Her voice was cold, but the rancour was gone from it.\\nShe looked at Gatsby. \"There, Jay,\" she said—but her hand as she tried\\nto light a cigarette was trembling. Suddenly she threw the cigarette\\nand the burning match on the carpet.\\n\"Oh, you want too much!\" she cried to Gatsby. \"I love you now—isn\\'t\\nthat enough? I can\\'t help what\\'s past.\" She began to sob\\nhelplessly. \"I did love him once—but I loved you too.\"\\nGatsby\\'s eyes opened and closed.\\n\"You loved me too?\" he repeated.\\n\"Even that\\'s a lie,\" said Tom savagely. \"She didn\\'t know you were\\nalive. Why—there\\'s things between Daisy and me that you\\'ll never know,\\nthings that neither of us can ever forget.\"\\nThe words seemed to bite physically into Gatsby.\\n\"I want to speak to Daisy alone,\" he insisted. \"She\\'s all excited\\nnow—\"\\n\"Even alone I can\\'t say I never loved Tom,\" she admitted in a pitiful\\nvoice. \"It wouldn\\'t be true.\"\\n\"Of course it wouldn\\'t,\" agreed Tom.\\nShe turned to her husband.\\n\"As if it mattered to you,\" she said.\\n\"Of course it matters. I\\'m going to take better care of you from now\\non.\"\\n\"You don\\'t understand,\" said Gatsby, with a touch of panic. \"You\\'re\\nnot going to take care of her any more.\"\\n\"I\\'m not?\" Tom opened his eyes wide and laughed. He could afford to\\ncontrol himself now. \"Why\\'s that?\"\\n\"Daisy\\'s leaving you.\"\\n\"Nonsense.\"\\n\"I am, though,\" she said with a visible effort.\\n\"She\\'s not leaving me!\" Tom\\'s words suddenly leaned down over Gatsby.\\n\"Certainly not for a common swindler who\\'d have to steal the ring he\\nput on her finger.\"\\n\"I won\\'t stand this!\" cried Daisy. \"Oh, please let\\'s get out.\"\\n\"Who are you, anyhow?\" broke out Tom. \"You\\'re one of that bunch that\\nhangs around with Meyer Wolfshiem—that much I happen to know. I\\'ve\\nmade a little investigation into your affairs—and I\\'ll carry it\\nfurther tomorrow.\"\\n\"You can suit yourself about that, old sport,\" said Gatsby steadily.\\n\"I found out what your \\'drugstores\\' were.\" He turned to us and spoke\\nrapidly. \"He and this Wolfshiem bought up a lot of side-street\\ndrugstores here and in Chicago and sold grain alcohol over the\\ncounter. That\\'s one of his little stunts. I picked him for a\\nbootlegger the first time I saw him, and I wasn\\'t far wrong.\"\\n\"What about it?\" said Gatsby politely. \"I guess your friend Walter\\nChase wasn\\'t too proud to come in on it.\"\\n\"And you left him in the lurch, didn\\'t you? You let him go to jail for\\na month over in New Jersey. God! You ought to hear Walter on the\\nsubject of you.\"\\n\"He came to us dead broke. He was very glad to pick up some money, old\\nsport.\"\\n\"Don\\'t you call me \\'old sport\\'!\" cried Tom. Gatsby said\\nnothing. \"Walter could have you up on the betting laws too, but\\nWolfshiem scared him into shutting his mouth.\"\\nThat unfamiliar yet recognizable look was back again in Gatsby\\'s face.\\n\"That drugstore business was just small change,\" continued Tom slowly,\\n\"but you\\'ve got something on now that Walter\\'s afraid to tell me\\nabout.\"',\n",

Then I turned back to\\nGatsby—and was startled at his expression. He looked—and this is said\\nin all contempt for the babbled slander of his garden—as if he had\\n\"killed a man.\" For a moment the set of his face could be described in\\njust that fantastic way.\\nIt passed, and he began to talk excitedly to Daisy, denying\\neverything, defending his name against accusations that had not been\\nmade. But with every word she was drawing further and further into\\nherself, so he gave that up, and only the dead dream fought on as the\\nafternoon slipped away, trying to touch what was no longer tangible,\\nstruggling unhappily, undespairingly, toward that lost voice across\\nthe room.\\nThe voice begged again to go.\\n\"Please, Tom! I can\\'t stand this any more.\"\\nHer frightened eyes told that whatever intentions, whatever courage\\nshe had had, were definitely gone.\\n\"You two start on home, Daisy,\" said Tom. \"In Mr. Gatsby\\'s car.\"\\nShe looked at Tom, alarmed now, but he insisted with magnanimous\\nscorn.\\n\"Go on.

       "   'text': 'isolated, like ghosts, even from our pity.\\nAfter a moment Tom got up and began wrapping the unopened bottle of\\nwhisky in the towel.\\n\"Want any of this stuff? Jordan? … Nick?\"\\nI didn\\'t answer.\\n\"Nick?\" He asked again.\\n\"What?\"\\n\"Want any?\"\\n\"No … I just remembered that today\\'s my birthday.\"\\nI was thirty. Before me stretched the portentous, menacing road of a\\nnew decade.\\nIt was seven o\\'clock when we got into the coupé with him and started\\nfor Long Island. Tom talked incessantly, exulting and laughing, but\\nhis voice was as remote from Jordan and me as the foreign clamour on\\nthe sidewalk or the tumult of the elevated overhead. Human sympathy\\nhas its limits, and we were content to let all their tragic arguments\\nfade with the city lights behind. Thirty—the promise of a decade of\\nloneliness, a thinning list of single men to know, a thinning\\nbriefcase of enthusiasm, thinning hair. But there was Jordan beside\\nme, who, unlike Daisy, was too wise ever to carry well-forgotten\\ndreams from age to age. As we passed over the dark bridge her wan face\\nfell lazily against my coat\\'s shoulder and the formidable stroke of\\nthirty died away with the reassuring pressure of her hand.\\nSo we drove on toward death through the cooling twilight.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe young Greek, Michaelis, who ran the coffee joint beside the\\nash-heaps was the principal witness at the inquest. He had slept\\nthrough the heat until after five, when he strolled over to the\\ngarage, and found George Wilson sick in his office—really sick, pale\\nas his own pale hair and shaking all over. Michaelis advised him to go\\nto bed, but Wilson refused, saying that he\\'d miss a lot of business if\\nhe did. While his neighbour was trying to persuade him a violent\\nracket broke out overhead.\\n\"I\\'ve got my wife locked in up there,\" explained Wilson calmly.\\n\"She\\'s going to stay there till the day after tomorrow, and then we\\'re\\ngoing to move away.\"\\nMichaelis was astonished; they had been neighbours for four years, and\\nWilson had never seemed faintly capable of such a statement.\\nGenerally he was one of these worn-out men: when he wasn\\'t working, he\\nsat on a chair in the doorway and stared at the people and the cars\\nthat passed along the road. When anyone spoke to him he invariably\\nlaughed in an agreeable, colourless way. He was his wife\\'s man and not\\nhis own.\\nSo naturally Michaelis tried to find out what had happened, but Wilson\\nwouldn\\'t say a word—instead he began to throw curious, suspicious\\nglances at his visitor and ask him what he\\'d been doing at certain\\ntimes on certain days. Just as the latter was getting uneasy, some\\nworkmen came past the door bound for his restaurant, and Michaelis\\ntook the opportunity to get away, intending to come back later. But he\\ndidn\\'t. He supposed he forgot to, that\\'s all. When he came outside\\nagain, a little after seven, he was reminded of the conversation\\nbecause he heard Mrs. Wilson\\'s voice, loud and scolding, downstairs in\\nthe garage.\\n\"Beat me!\" he heard her cry. \"Throw me down and beat me, you dirty\\nlittle coward!\"\\nA moment later she rushed out into the dusk, waving her hands and\\nshouting—before he could move from his door the business was over.\\nThe \"death car\" as the newspapers called it, didn\\'t stop; it came out\\nof the gathering darkness, wavered tragically for a moment, and then\\ndisappeared around the next bend. Mavro Michaelis wasn\\'t even sure of\\nits colour—he told the first policeman that it was light green. The\\nother car, the one going toward New York, came to rest a hundred yards\\nbeyond, and its driver hurried back to where Myrtle Wilson, her life\\nviolently extinguished, knelt in the road and mingled her thick dark\\nblood with the dust.\\nMichaelis and this man reached her first, but when they had torn open\\nher shirtwaist, still damp with perspiration, they saw that her left\\nbreast was swinging loose like a flap, and there was no need to listen\\nfor the heart beneath. The mouth was wide open and ripped a little at\\nthe corners, as though she had choked a little in giving up the\\ntremendous vitality she had stored so long.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nWe saw the three or four automobiles and the crowd when we were still\\nsome distance away.\\n\"Wreck!\" said Tom. \"That\\'s good. Wilson\\'ll have a little business at\\nlast.\"\\nHe slowed down, but still without any intention of stopping, until, as\\nwe came nearer, the hushed, intent faces of the people at the garage\\ndoor made him automatically put on the brakes.\\n\"We\\'ll take a look,\" he said doubtfully, \"just a look.\"\\nI became aware now of a hollow, wailing sound which issued incessantly\\nfrom the garage, a sound which as we got out of the coupé and walked\\ntoward the door resolved itself into the words \"Oh, my God!\" uttered\\nover and over in a gasping moan.\\n\"There\\'s some bad trouble here,\" said Tom excitedly.\\nHe reached up on tiptoes and peered over a circle of heads into the\\ngarage, which was lit only by a yellow light in a swinging metal\\nbasket overhead. Then he made a harsh sound in his throat, and with a\\nviolent thrusting movement of his powerful arms pushed his way\\nthrough.\\nThe circle closed up again with a running murmur of expostulation; it\\nwas a minute before I could see anything at all. Then new arrivals\\nderanged the line, and Jordan and I were pushed suddenly inside.\\nMyrtle Wilson\\'s body, wrapped in a blanket, and then in another\\nblanket, as though she suffered from a chill in the hot night, lay on\\na worktable by the wall, and Tom, with his back to us, was bending\\nover it, motionless. Next to him stood a motorcycle policeman taking\\ndown names with much sweat and correction in a little book. At first I\\ncouldn\\'t find the source of the high, groaning words that echoed\\nclamorously through the bare garage—then I saw Wilson standing on the\\nraised threshold of his office, swaying back and forth and holding to\\nthe doorposts with both hands. Some man was talking to him in a low\\nvoice and attempting, from time to time, to lay a hand on his\\nshoulder, but Wilson neither heard nor saw. His eyes would drop slowly\\nfrom the swinging light to the laden table by the wall, and then jerk\\nback to the light again, and he gave out incessantly his high,\\nhorrible call:\\n\"Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od! Oh, Ga-od! Oh, my Ga-od!\"\\nPresently Tom lifted his head with a jerk and, after staring around\\nthe garage with glazed eyes, addressed a mumbled incoherent remark to\\nthe policeman.\\n\"M-a-v—\" the policeman was saying, \"—o—\"\\n\"No, r—\" corrected the man, \"M-a-v-r-o—\"\\n\"Listen to me!\" muttered Tom fiercely.\\n\"r—\" said the policeman, \"o—\"\\n\"g—\"\\n\"g—\" He looked up as Tom\\'s broad hand fell sharply on his shoulder.\\n\"What you want, fella?\"\\n\"What happened?—that\\'s what I want to know.\"\\n\"Auto hit her. Ins\\'antly killed.\"\\n\"Instantly killed,\" repeated Tom, staring.\\n\"She ran out ina road. Son-of-a-bitch didn\\'t even stopus car.\"\\n\"There was two cars,\" said Michaelis, \"one comin\\', one goin\\', see?\"\\n\"Going where?\" asked the policeman keenly.\\n\"One goin\\' each way. Well, she\"—his hand rose toward the blankets but\\nstopped halfway and fell to his side—\"she ran out there an\\' the one\\ncomin\\' from N\\'York knock right into her, goin\\' thirty or forty miles\\nan hour.\"\\n\"What\\'s the name of this place here?\" demanded the officer.\\n\"Hasn\\'t got any name.\"\\nA pale well-dressed negro stepped near.\\n\"It was a yellow car,\" he said, \"big yellow car. New.\"\\n\"See the accident?\" asked the policeman.\\n\"No, but the car passed me down the road, going faster\\'n forty. Going\\nfifty, sixty.\"\\n\"Come here and let\\'s have your name. Look out now. I want to get his\\nname.\"\\nSome words of this conversation must have reached Wilson, swaying in\\nthe office door, for suddenly a new theme found voice among his\\ngrasping cries:\\n\"You don\\'t have to tell me what kind of car it was! I know what kind\\nof car it was!\"\\nWatching Tom, I saw the wad of muscle back of his shoulder tighten\\nunder his coat. He walked quickly over to Wilson and, standing in\\nfront of him, seized him firmly by the upper arms.\\n\"You\\'ve got to pull yourself together,\" he said with soothing\\ngruffness.\\nWilson\\'s eyes fell upon Tom; he started up on his tiptoes and then\\nwould have collapsed to his knees had not Tom held him upright.\\n\"Listen,\" said Tom, shaking him a little. \"I just got here a minute\\nago, from New York. I was bringing you that coupé we\\'ve been talking\\nabout. That yellow car I was driving this afternoon wasn\\'t mine—do you\\nhear? I haven\\'t seen it all afternoon.\"\\nOnly the negro and I were near enough to hear what he said, but the\\npoliceman caught something in the tone and looked over with truculent\\neyes.\\n\"What\\'s all that?\" he demanded.\\n\"I\\'m a friend of his.\" Tom turned his head but kept his hands firm on\\nWilson\\'s body. \"He says he knows the car that did it … It was a yellow\\ncar.\"\\nSome dim impulse moved the policeman to look suspiciously at Tom.\\n\"And what colour\\'s your car?\"\\n\"It\\'s a blue car, a coupé.\"\\n\"We\\'ve come straight from New York,\" I said.\\nSomeone who had been driving a little behind us confirmed this, and\\nthe policeman turned away.\\n\"Now, if you\\'ll let me have that name again correct—\"\\nPicking up Wilson like a doll, Tom carried him into the office, set\\nhim down in a chair, and came back.\\n\"If somebody\\'ll come here and sit with him,\" he snapped\\nauthoritatively. He watched while the two men standing closest glanced\\nat each other and went unwillingly into the room. Then Tom shut the\\ndoor on them and came down the single step, his eyes avoiding the\\ntable. As he passed close to me he whispered: \"Let\\'s get out.\"\\nSelf-consciously, with his authoritative arms breaking the way, we\\npushed through the still gathering crowd, passing a hurried doctor,\\ncase in hand, who had been sent for in wild hope half an hour ago.\\nTom drove slowly until we were beyond the bend—then his foot came down\\nhard, and the coupé raced along through the night. In a little while I\\nheard a low husky sob, and saw that the tears were overflowing down\\nhis face.\\n\"The God damned coward!\" he whimpered. \"He didn\\'t even stop his car.\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nThe Buchanans\\' house floated suddenly toward us through the dark\\nrustling trees. Tom stopped beside the porch and looked up at the\\nsecond floor, where two windows bloomed with light among the vines.\\n\"Daisy\\'s home,\" he said. As we got out of the car he glanced at me and\\nfrowned slightly.\\n\"I ought to have dropped you in West Egg, Nick. There\\'s nothing we can\\ndo tonight.\"\\nA change had come over him, and he spoke gravely, and with decision.\\nAs we walked across the moonlight gravel to the porch he disposed of\\nthe situation in a few brisk phrases.\\n\"I\\'ll telephone for a taxi to take you home, and while you\\'re waiting\\nyou and Jordan better go in the kitchen and have them get you some\\nsupper—if you want any.\" He opened the door. \"Come in.\"\\n\"No, thanks. But I\\'d be glad if you\\'d order me the taxi. I\\'ll wait\\noutside.\"\\nJordan put her hand on my arm.\\n\"Won\\'t you come in, Nick?\"\\n\"No, thanks.\"\\nI was feeling a little sick and I wanted to be alone. But Jordan\\nlingered for a moment more.\\n\"It\\'s only half-past nine,\" she said.\\nI\\'d be damned if I\\'d go in; I\\'d had enough of all of them for one day,\\nand suddenly that included Jordan too. She must have seen something of\\nthis in my expression, for she turned abruptly away and ran up the\\nporch steps into the house. I sat down for a few minutes with my head\\nin my hands, until I heard the phone taken up inside and the butler\\'s\\nvoice calling a taxi. Then I walked slowly down the drive away from\\nthe house, intending to wait by the gate.\\nI hadn\\'t gone twenty yards when I heard my name and Gatsby stepped\\nfrom between two bushes into the path. I must have felt pretty weird\\nby that time, because I could think of nothing except the luminosity\\nof his pink suit under the moon.\\n\"What are you doing?\" I inquired.\\n\"Just standing here, old sport.\"\\nSomehow, that seemed a despicable occupation. For all I knew he was\\ngoing to rob the house in a moment; I wouldn\\'t have been surprised to\\nsee sinister faces, the faces of \"Wolfshiem\\'s people,\" behind him in\\nthe dark shrubbery.\\n\"Did you see any trouble on the road?\" he asked after a minute.\\n\"Yes.\"\\nHe hesitated.\\n\"Was she killed?\"\\n\"Yes.\"\\n\"I thought so; I told Daisy I thought so. It\\'s better that the shock\\nshould all come at once. She stood it pretty well.\"\\nHe spoke as if Daisy\\'s reaction was the only thing that mattered.\\n\"I got to West Egg by a side road,\" he went on, \"and left the car in\\nmy garage. I don\\'t think anybody saw us, but of course I can\\'t be\\nsure.\"\\nI disliked him so much by this time that I didn\\'t find it necessary to\\ntell him he was wrong.\\n\"Who was the woman?\" he inquired.\\n\"Her name was Wilson. Her husband owns the garage. How the devil did\\nit happen?\"\\n\"Well, I tried to swing the wheel—\" He broke off, and suddenly I\\nguessed at the truth.\\n\"Was Daisy driving?\"\\n\"Yes,\" he said after a moment, \"but of course I\\'ll say I was. You see,\\nwhen we left New York she was very nervous and she thought it would\\nsteady her to drive—and this woman rushed out at us just as we were\\npassing a car coming the other way. It all happened in a minute, but\\nit seemed to me that she wanted to speak to us, thought we were\\nsomebody she knew. Well, first Daisy turned away from the woman toward\\nthe other car, and then she lost her nerve and turned back. The second\\nmy hand reached the wheel I felt the shock—it must have killed her\\ninstantly.\"\\n\"It ripped her open—\"\\n\"Don\\'t tell me, old sport.\" He winced. \"Anyhow—Daisy stepped on it. I\\ntried to make her stop, but she couldn\\'t, so I pulled on the emergency\\nbrake. Then she fell over into my lap and I drove on.\\n\"She\\'ll be all right tomorrow,\" he said presently. \"I\\'m just going to\\nwait here and see if he tries to bother her about that unpleasantness\\nthis afternoon. She\\'s locked herself into her room, and if he tries\\nany brutality she\\'s going to turn the light out and on again.\"\\n\"He won\\'t touch her,\" I said. \"He\\'s not thinking about her.\"\\n\"I don\\'t trust him, old sport.\"\\n\"How long are you going to wait?\"\\n\"All night, if necessary. Anyhow, till they all go to bed.\"\\nA new point of view occurred to me. Suppose Tom found out that Daisy\\nhad been driving. He might think he saw a connection in it—he might\\nthink anything. I looked at the house; there were two or three bright\\nwindows downstairs and the pink glow from Daisy\\'s room on the ground\\nfloor.\\n\"You wait here,\" I said. \"I\\'ll see if there\\'s any sign of a\\ncommotion.\"\\nI walked back along the border of the lawn, traversed the gravel\\nsoftly, and tiptoed up the veranda steps. The drawing-room curtains\\nwere open, and I saw that the room was empty. Crossing the porch where\\nwe had dined that June night three months before, I came to a small\\nrectangle of light which I guessed was the pantry window. The blind\\nwas drawn, but I found a rift at the sill.\\nDaisy and Tom were sitting opposite each other at the kitchen table,\\nwith a plate of cold fried chicken between them, and two bottles of\\nale. He was talking intently across the table at her, and in his\\nearnestness his hand had fallen upon and covered her own. Once in a\\nwhile she looked up at him and nodded in agreement.\\nThey weren\\'t happy, and neither of them had touched the chicken or the\\nale—and yet they weren\\'t unhappy either. There was an unmistakable air\\nof natural intimacy about the picture, and anybody would have said\\nthat they were conspiring together.',\n",

I think that he would have acknowledged anything now, without\\nreserve, but he wanted to talk about Daisy.\\nShe was the first \"nice\" girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed\\ncapacities he had come in contact with such people, but always with\\nindiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly\\ndesirable. He went to her house, at first with other officers from\\nCamp Taylor, then alone. It amazed him—he had never been in such a\\nbeautiful house before. But what gave it an air of breathless\\nintensity, was that Daisy lived there—it was as casual a thing to her\\nas his tent out at camp was to him. There was a ripe mystery about it,\\na hint of bedrooms upstairs more beautiful and cool than other\\nbedrooms, of gay and radiant activities taking place through its\\ncorridors, and of romances that were not musty and laid away already\\nin lavender but fresh and breathing and redolent of this year\\'s\\nshining motorcars and of dances whose flowers were scarcely\\nwithered. It excited him, too, that many men had already loved\\nDaisy—it increased her value in his eyes. He felt their presence all\\nabout the house, pervading the air with the shades and echoes of still\\nvibrant emotions.\\nBut he knew that he was in Daisy\\'s house by a colossal\\naccident. However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was\\nat present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the\\ninvisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders. So he\\nmade the most of his time. He took what he could get, ravenously and\\nunscrupulously—eventually he took Daisy one still October night, took\\nher because he had no real right to touch her hand.\\nHe might have despised himself, for he had certainly taken her under\\nfalse pretences. I don\\'t mean that he had traded on his phantom\\nmillions, but he had deliberately given Daisy a sense of security; he\\nlet her believe that he was a person from much the same strata as\\nherself—that he was fully able to take care of her. As a matter of\\nfact, he had no such facilities—he had no comfortable family standing\\nbehind him, and he was liable at the whim of an impersonal government\\nto be blown anywhere about the world.\\nBut he didn\\'t despise himself and it didn\\'t turn out as he had\\nimagined. He had intended, probably, to take what he could and go—but\\nnow he found that he had committed himself to the following of a\\ngrail. He knew that Daisy was extraordinary, but he didn\\'t realize\\njust how extraordinary a \"nice\" girl could be. She vanished into her\\nrich house, into her rich, full life, leaving Gatsby—nothing.

The gardener, the last one of\\nGatsby\\'s former servants, came to the foot of the steps.\\n\"I\\'m going to drain the pool today, Mr. Gatsby. Leaves\\'ll start\\nfalling pretty soon, and then there\\'s always trouble with the pipes.\"\\n\"Don\\'t do it today,\" Gatsby answered. He turned to me apologetically.\\n\"You know, old sport, I\\'ve never used that pool all summer?\"\\nI looked at my watch and stood up.\\n\"Twelve minutes to my train.\"\\nI didn\\'t want to go to the city. I wasn\\'t worth a decent stroke of\\nwork, but it was more than that—I didn\\'t want to leave Gatsby. I\\nmissed that train, and then another, before I could get myself away.\\n\"I\\'ll call you up,\" I said finally.\\n\"Do, old sport.\"\\n\"I\\'ll call you about noon.\"\\nWe walked slowly down the steps.\\n\"I suppose Daisy\\'ll call too.\" He looked at me anxiously, as if he\\nhoped I\\'d corroborate this.\\n\"I suppose so.\"\\n\"Well, goodbye.\"\\nWe shook hands and I started away. Just before I reached the hedge I\\nremembered something and turned around.\\n\"They\\'re a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You\\'re worth the\\nwhole damn bunch put together.\"\\nI\\'ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever\\ngave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end. First he\\nnodded politely, and then his face broke into that radiant and\\nunderstanding smile, as if we\\'d been in ecstatic cahoots on that fact\\nall the time. His gorgeous pink rag of a suit made a bright spot of\\ncolour against the white steps, and I thought of the night when I\\nfirst came to his ancestral home, three months before. The lawn and\\ndrive had been crowded with the faces of those who guessed at his\\ncorruption—and he had stood on those steps, concealing his\\nincorruptible dream, as he waved them goodbye.\\nI thanked him for his hospitality. We were always thanking him for\\nthat—I and the others.\\n\"Goodbye,\" I called. \"I enjoyed breakfast, Gatsby.\"\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------',\n",

       "   'text': 'By six o\\'clock Michaelis was worn out, and grateful for the sound of a\\ncar stopping outside. It was one of the watchers of the night before\\nwho had promised to come back, so he cooked breakfast for three, which\\nhe and the other man ate together. Wilson was quieter now, and\\nMichaelis went home to sleep; when he awoke four hours later and\\nhurried back to the garage, Wilson was gone.\\nHis movements—he was on foot all the time—were afterward traced to\\nPort Roosevelt and then to Gad\\'s Hill, where he bought a sandwich that\\nhe didn\\'t eat, and a cup of coffee. He must have been tired and\\nwalking slowly, for he didn\\'t reach Gad\\'s Hill until noon. Thus far\\nthere was no difficulty in accounting for his time—there were boys who\\nhad seen a man \"acting sort of crazy,\" and motorists at whom he stared\\noddly from the side of the road. Then for three hours he disappeared\\nfrom view. The police, on the strength of what he said to Michaelis,\\nthat he \"had a way of finding out,\" supposed that he spent that time\\ngoing from garage to garage thereabout, inquiring for a yellow car. On\\nthe other hand, no garage man who had seen him ever came forward, and\\nperhaps he had an easier, surer way of finding out what he wanted to\\nknow. By half-past two he was in West Egg, where he asked someone the\\nway to Gatsby\\'s house. So by that time he knew Gatsby\\'s name.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAt two o\\'clock Gatsby put on his bathing-suit and left word with the\\nbutler that if anyone phoned word was to be brought to him at the\\npool. He stopped at the garage for a pneumatic mattress that had\\namused his guests during the summer, and the chauffeur helped him to\\npump it up. Then he gave instructions that the open car wasn\\'t to be\\ntaken out under any circumstances—and this was strange, because the\\nfront right fender needed repair.\\nGatsby shouldered the mattress and started for the pool. Once he\\nstopped and shifted it a little, and the chauffeur asked him if he\\nneeded help, but he shook his head and in a moment disappeared among\\nthe yellowing trees.\\nNo telephone message arrived, but the butler went without his sleep\\nand waited for it until four o\\'clock—until long after there was anyone\\nto give it to if it came. I have an idea that Gatsby himself didn\\'t\\nbelieve it would come, and perhaps he no longer cared. If that was\\ntrue he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a\\nhigh price for living too long with a single dream. He must have\\nlooked up at an unfamiliar sky through frightening leaves and shivered\\nas he found what a grotesque thing a rose is and how raw the sunlight\\nwas upon the scarcely created grass. A new world, material without\\nbeing real, where poor ghosts, breathing dreams like air, drifted\\nfortuitously about … like that ashen, fantastic figure gliding toward\\nhim through the amorphous trees.\\nThe chauffeur—he was one of Wolfshiem\\'s protégés—heard the\\nshots—afterwards he could only say that he hadn\\'t thought anything\\nmuch about them. I drove from the station directly to Gatsby\\'s house\\nand my rushing anxiously up the front steps was the first thing that\\nalarmed anyone. But they knew then, I firmly believe.

       "   'text': 'After two years I remember the rest of that day, and that night and\\nthe next day, only as an endless drill of police and photographers and\\nnewspaper men in and out of Gatsby\\'s front door. A rope stretched\\nacross the main gate and a policeman by it kept out the curious, but\\nlittle boys soon discovered that they could enter through my yard, and\\nthere were always a few of them clustered open-mouthed about the\\npool. Someone with a positive manner, perhaps a detective, used the\\nexpression \"madman\" as he bent over Wilson\\'s body that afternoon, and\\nthe adventitious authority of his voice set the key for the newspaper\\nreports next morning.\\nMost of those reports were a nightmare—grotesque, circumstantial,\\neager, and untrue. When Michaelis\\'s testimony at the inquest brought\\nto light Wilson\\'s suspicions of his wife I thought the whole tale\\nwould shortly be served up in racy pasquinade—but Catherine, who might\\nhave said anything, didn\\'t say a word. She showed a surprising amount\\nof character about it too—looked at the coroner with determined eyes\\nunder that corrected brow of hers, and swore that her sister had never\\nseen Gatsby, that her sister was completely happy with her husband,\\nthat her sister had been into no mischief whatever. She convinced\\nherself of it, and cried into her handkerchief, as if the very\\nsuggestion was more than she could endure. So Wilson was reduced to a\\nman \"deranged by grief\" in order that the case might remain in its\\nsimplest form. And it rested there.\\nBut all this part of it seemed remote and unessential. I found myself\\non Gatsby\\'s side, and alone. From the moment I telephoned news of the\\ncatastrophe to West Egg village, every surmise about him, and every\\npractical question, was referred to me. At first I was surprised and\\nconfused; then, as he lay in his house and didn\\'t move or breathe or\\nspeak, hour upon hour, it grew upon me that I was responsible, because\\nno one else was interested—interested, I mean, with that intense\\npersonal interest to which everyone has some vague right at the end.\\nI called up Daisy half an hour after we found him, called her\\ninstinctively and without hesitation. But she and Tom had gone away\\nearly that afternoon, and taken baggage with them.\\n\"Left no address?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Say when they\\'d be back?\"\\n\"No.\"\\n\"Any idea where they are? How I could reach them?\"\\n\"I don\\'t know. Can\\'t say.\"\\nI wanted to get somebody for him. I wanted to go into the room where\\nhe lay and reassure him: \"I\\'ll get somebody for you, Gatsby. Don\\'t\\nworry. Just trust me and I\\'ll get somebody for you—\"\\nMeyer Wolfshiem\\'s name wasn\\'t in the phone book. The butler gave me\\nhis office address on Broadway, and I called Information, but by the\\ntime I had the number it was long after five, and no one answered the\\nphone.\\n\"Will you ring again?\"\\n\"I\\'ve rung three times.\"\\n\"It\\'s very important.\"\\n\"Sorry. I\\'m afraid no one\\'s there.\"\\nI went back to the drawing-room and thought for an instant that they\\nwere chance visitors, all these official people who suddenly filled\\nit. But, though they drew back the sheet and looked at Gatsby with\\nshocked eyes, his protest continued in my brain:\\n\"Look here, old sport, you\\'ve got to get somebody for me. You\\'ve got\\nto try hard. I can\\'t go through this alone.\"\\nSomeone started to ask me questions, but I broke away and going\\nupstairs looked hastily through the unlocked parts of his desk—he\\'d\\nnever told me definitely that his parents were dead. But there was\\nnothing—only the picture of Dan Cody, a token of forgotten violence,\\nstaring down from the wall.\\nNext morning I sent the butler to New York with a letter to Wolfshiem,\\nwhich asked for information and urged him to come out on the next\\ntrain. That request seemed superfluous when I wrote it. I was sure\\nhe\\'d start when he saw the newspapers, just as I was sure there\\'d be a\\nwire from Daisy before noon—but neither a wire nor Mr. Wolfshiem\\narrived; no one arrived except more police and photographers and',\n",

He had reached an age where death no longer has the\\nquality of ghastly surprise, and when he looked around him now for the\\nfirst time and saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great\\nrooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be\\nmixed with an awed pride.

I saw right\\naway he was a fine-appearing, gentlemanly young man, and when he told\\nme he was at Oggsford I knew I could use him good.

       "   'text': 'One of my most vivid memories is of coming back West from prep school\\nand later from college at Christmas time. Those who went farther than\\nChicago would gather in the old dim Union Station at six o\\'clock of a\\nDecember evening, with a few Chicago friends, already caught up into\\ntheir own holiday gaieties, to bid them a hasty goodbye. I remember\\nthe fur coats of the girls returning from Miss This-or-That\\'s and the\\nchatter of frozen breath and the hands waving overhead as we caught\\nsight of old acquaintances, and the matchings of invitations: \"Are you\\ngoing to the Ordways\\'? the Herseys\\'? the Schultzes\\'?\" and the long\\ngreen tickets clasped tight in our gloved hands. And last the murky\\nyellow cars of the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul railroad looking\\ncheerful as Christmas itself on the tracks beside the gate.\\nWhen we pulled out into the winter night and the real snow, our snow,\\nbegan to stretch out beside us and twinkle against the windows, and\\nthe dim lights of small Wisconsin stations moved by, a sharp wild\\nbrace came suddenly into the air. We drew in deep breaths of it as we\\nwalked back from dinner through the cold vestibules, unutterably aware\\nof our identity with this country for one strange hour, before we\\nmelted indistinguishably into it again.\\nThat\\'s my Middle West—not the wheat or the prairies or the lost Swede\\ntowns, but the thrilling returning trains of my youth, and the street\\nlamps and sleigh bells in the frosty dark and the shadows of holly\\nwreaths thrown by lighted windows on the snow. I am part of that, a\\nlittle solemn with the feel of those long winters, a little complacent\\nfrom growing up in the Carraway house in a city where dwellings are\\nstill called through decades by a family\\'s name. I see now that this\\nhas been a story of the West, after all—Tom and Gatsby, Daisy and\\nJordan and I, were all Westerners, and perhaps we possessed some\\ndeficiency in common which made us subtly unadaptable to Eastern life.\\nEven when the East excited me most, even when I was most keenly aware\\nof its superiority to the bored, sprawling, swollen towns beyond the\\nOhio, with their interminable inquisitions which spared only the\\nchildren and the very old—even then it had always for me a quality of\\ndistortion. West Egg, especially, still figures in my more fantastic\\ndreams. I see it as a night scene by El Greco: a hundred houses, at\\nonce conventional and grotesque, crouching under a sullen, overhanging\\nsky and a lustreless moon. In the foreground four solemn men in dress\\nsuits are walking along the sidewalk with a stretcher on which lies a\\ndrunken woman in a white evening dress. Her hand, which dangles over\\nthe side, sparkles cold with jewels. Gravely the men turn in at a\\nhouse—the wrong house. But no one knows the woman\\'s name, and no one\\ncares.\\nAfter Gatsby\\'s death the East was haunted for me like that, distorted\\nbeyond my eyes\\' power of correction. So when the blue smoke of brittle\\nleaves was in the air and the wind blew the wet laundry stiff on the\\nline I decided to come back home.\\nThere was one thing to be done before I left, an awkward, unpleasant\\nthing that perhaps had better have been let alone. But I wanted to\\nleave things in order and not just trust that obliging and indifferent\\nsea to sweep my refuse away. I saw Jordan Baker and talked over and\\naround what had happened to us together, and what had happened\\nafterward to me, and she lay perfectly still, listening, in a big\\nchair.\\nShe was dressed to play golf, and I remember thinking she looked like\\na good illustration, her chin raised a little jauntily, her hair the\\ncolour of an autumn leaf, her face the same brown tint as the\\nfingerless glove on her knee. When I had finished she told me without\\ncomment that she was engaged to another man. I doubted that, though\\nthere were several she could have married at a nod of her head, but I\\npretended to be surprised. For just a minute I wondered if I wasn\\'t\\nmaking a mistake, then I thought it all over again quickly and got up\\nto say goodbye.\\n\"Nevertheless you did throw me over,\" said Jordan suddenly. \"You threw\\nme over on the telephone. I don\\'t give a damn about you now, but it\\nwas a new experience for me, and I felt a little dizzy for a while.\"\\nWe shook hands.\\n\"Oh, and do you remember\"—she added—\"a conversation we had once about\\ndriving a car?\"\\n\"Why—not exactly.\"\\n\"You said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver?\\nWell, I met another bad driver, didn\\'t I? I mean it was careless of me\\nto make such a wrong guess. I thought you were rather an honest,\\nstraightforward person. I thought it was your secret pride.\"\\n\"I\\'m thirty,\" I said. \"I\\'m five years too old to lie to myself and\\ncall it honour.\"\\nShe didn\\'t answer. Angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously\\nsorry, I turned away.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nOne afternoon late in October I saw Tom Buchanan. He was walking ahead\\nof me along Fifth Avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a\\nlittle from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving\\nsharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. Just as\\nI slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into\\nthe windows of a jewellery store. Suddenly he saw me and walked back,\\nholding out his hand.\\n\"What\\'s the matter, Nick? Do you object to shaking hands with me?\"\\n\"Yes. You know what I think of you.\"\\n\"You\\'re crazy, Nick,\" he said quickly. \"Crazy as hell. I don\\'t know\\nwhat\\'s the matter with you.\"\\n\"Tom,\" I inquired, \"what did you say to Wilson that afternoon?\"\\nHe stared at me without a word, and I knew I had guessed right about\\nthose missing hours. I started to turn away, but he took a step after\\nme and grabbed my arm.\\n\"I told him the truth,\" he said. \"He came to the door while we were\\ngetting ready to leave, and when I sent down word that we weren\\'t in\\nhe tried to force his way upstairs. He was crazy enough to kill me if\\nI hadn\\'t told him who owned the car. His hand was on a revolver in his\\npocket every minute he was in the house—\" He broke off defiantly.\\n\"What if I did tell him? That fellow had it coming to him. He threw\\ndust into your eyes just like he did in Daisy\\'s, but he was a tough\\none. He ran over Myrtle like you\\'d run over a dog and never even\\nstopped his car.\"\\nThere was nothing I could say, except the one unutterable fact that it\\nwasn\\'t true.\\n\"And if you think I didn\\'t have my share of suffering—look here, when\\nI went to give up that flat and saw that damn box of dog biscuits\\nsitting there on the sideboard, I sat down and cried like a baby. By\\nGod it was awful—\"\\nI couldn\\'t forgive him or like him, but I saw that what he had done\\nwas, to him, entirely justified. It was all very careless and\\nconfused. They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up\\nthings and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their\\nvast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let\\nother people clean up the mess they had made …\\nI shook hands with him; it seemed silly not to, for I felt suddenly as\\nthough I were talking to a child. Then he went into the jewellery\\nstore to buy a pearl necklace—or perhaps only a pair of cuff\\nbuttons—rid of my provincial squeamishness forever.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nGatsby\\'s house was still empty when I left—the grass on his lawn had\\ngrown as long as mine. One of the taxi drivers in the village never\\ntook a fare past the entrance gate without stopping for a minute and\\npointing inside; perhaps it was he who drove Daisy and Gatsby over to\\nEast Egg the night of the accident, and perhaps he had made a story\\nabout it all his own. I didn\\'t want to hear it and I avoided him when\\nI got off the train.\\nI spent my Saturday nights in New York because those gleaming,\\ndazzling parties of his were with me so vividly that I could still\\nhear the music and the laughter, faint and incessant, from his garden,\\nand the cars going up and down his drive. One night I did hear a\\nmaterial car there, and saw its lights stop at his front steps. But I\\ndidn\\'t investigate. Probably it was some final guest who had been away\\nat the ends of the earth and didn\\'t know that the party was over.\\nOn the last night, with my trunk packed and my car sold to the grocer,\\nI went over and looked at that huge incoherent failure of a house once\\nmore. On the white steps an obscene word, scrawled by some boy with a\\npiece of brick, stood out clearly in the moonlight, and I erased it,\\ndrawing my shoe raspingly along the stone. Then I wandered down to the\\nbeach and sprawled out on the sand.\\nMost of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any\\nlights except the shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the\\nSound. And as the moon rose higher the inessential houses began to\\nmelt away until gradually I became aware of the old island here that\\nflowered once for Dutch sailors\\' eyes—a fresh, green breast of the new\\nworld. Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby\\'s\\nhouse, had once pandered in whispers to the last and greatest of all\\nhuman dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment man must have held his\\nbreath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an aesthetic\\ncontemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the\\nlast time in history with something commensurate to his capacity for\\nwonder.\\nAnd as I sat there brooding on the old, unknown world, I thought of\\nGatsby\\'s wonder when he first picked out the green light at the end of\\nDaisy\\'s dock. He had come a long way to this blue lawn, and his dream\\nmust have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He\\ndid not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that\\nvast obscurity beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic\\nrolled on under the night.\\nGatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by\\nyear recedes before us. It eluded us then, but that\\'s no\\nmatter—tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our arms further … And\\none fine morning—\\nSo we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into',\n",
