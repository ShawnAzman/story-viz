       "   'text': 'The summer copper pheasants are crowing up a storm.\\nTraveling down the narrow paved path that runs along the hillside and\\ndescending several stone-walled stairways, we emerge from the shadow of the\\nmountain into direct sunlight. Below us is a round lake, Itomori Lake. Its calm\\nsurface reflects the morning sun, glittering and glaring as though nobody\\'s\\nwatching. The deep-green mountains form their ranks under white clouds in a\\nblue sky, and a little girl with pigtails and a red school backpack skips along\\nfor no reason. Then there\\'s me beside her, the dazzling, bare-legged high\\nschool girl. In my head, I try adding a grand string score to the scene as\\nbackground music. Ooh, it\\'s just like the opening of a Japanese film... In other\\nwords, we live in the boonies—very Japanese and a few decades behind the\\ntimes.\\n\"Miiitsuhaaa!\"\\nAfter Yotsuha and I part ways in front of the elementary school, a voice\\ncalls out from behind me. It\\'s Tesshi, pedaling his bike and looking cranky,\\nwith Saya seated primly on the bike rack and smiling.\\n\"Hurry up and get off,\" Tesshi grumbles.\\n\"I\\'m fine right here. Don\\'t be stingy!\"\\n\"C\\'mon, you\\'re heavy.\"\\n\"And you\\'re rude!\"\\nThis early in the morning, and they\\'re already teasing each other like a\\nmarried couple in a comedy skit.\\n\"You two get along so well.\"\\n\"We do not!\" they chorus.\\nThey deny it so earnestly it\\'s funny, and I giggle. My mental soundtrack\\nswitches over to a jaunty guitar solo. The three of us have been friends for a\\ngood ten years—petite Saya, with her braids and straight-across bangs, and\\ntall, skinny Tesshi with his burr cut and general lack of style. They always look\\nlike they\\'re fighting, but given how their conversation is always perfectly\\nsynced, I secretly think they might make an excellent couple.\\n\"Oh, Mitsuha, you did your hair properly today.\"\\nSaya, who\\'s gotten off the bike, touches the area around my hair cord,\\ngrinning. My hair\\'s fixed the same as always: two braids looped up and tied\\ntogether in the back with the cord. My mom taught me how, a long time ago.\\n\"Huh? What about my hair?\"\\nHer comment sparks a recollection of the comments that sort of got lost in\\nthe shuffle at breakfast. I did it \"properly\" today—does that mean it was weird\\nyesterday? As I\\'m trying to remember what happened, Tesshi leans in, looking\\nconcerned. \"Hey, you did get your grandma to exorcise you, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\"Exorcise?\"\\n\"Yeah, I swear you got yourself possessed by a fox!\"\\n\".. .Excuse me?\" I frown at the unexpected remark.\\nSaya speaks up for me, sounding disgusted. \"Would you quit blamin\\'\\neverythin\\' on the occult already?! Mitsuha\\'s probably just stressed, that\\'s all.\\nRight?\"\\nStressed?\\n\"Huh? Wait, hold it—what\\'s all this about?\"\\nWhy is literally everybody worried about me? Yesterday was... I can\\'t\\nremember off the top of my head, but I\\'m pretty sure it was just a regular day.\\n...Hmm?\\nWait, was it really? Yesterday, I...\\n\"—And most importantly!\"\\nA deep voice from a megaphone erases my questions.\\nOn the other side of the road, with its rows of vinyl greenhouses, a little\\ncrowd of a dozen or so people is gathered in the ridiculously big municipal\\nparking lot. Standing at its center, holding a microphone, is my dad, taller and\\nbolder-looking than the rest. The banner he wears diagonally across his suit\\njacket proudly proclaims, Incumbent—Toshiki Miyamizu. He\\'s stumping for\\nthe mayoral election.\\n\"Most importantly, economic revitalization, in order to sustain the\\nvillage restoration project! Only when we have made that a reality will we\\nbe able to establish a safe, worry-free community. As the incumbent, I\\nintend to refine the community planning I\\'ve been involved with and see it\\nthrough to completion! I will lead this region with new enthusiasm,\\ncreating a local society in which everyone—from our children to our senior\\ncitizens—can relax and enjoy fulfilling, active lives. I have renewed my\\nresolve to make this vision my goal...\"\\nIt\\'s such a skillful speech that it\\'s almost overbearing. It leaves me cold—\\nthis campaign address sounds like it belongs on TV, not in a parking lot\\nsurrounded by fields. The whispers I hear from the crowd— \"You know it\\'s\\ngonna be Miyamizu again this term anyway, \" \"It sounds like he s been\\nspreadin \\' lots of cash around\" —make my mood even darker.\\n\"Hey, Miyamizu.\"\\n\"...Mornin\\'.\"\\nWonderful. The greeting comes from three classmates I\\'m less than fond of.\\nEven in high school, they\\'re part of the flashy \"in-crowd,\" and they snark at us\\n—the \"drones\"—over every little thing.\\n\"The mayor and the contractor,\" one of them says, shooting a deliberate\\nglance at my orating father. When I follow suit, I see Tesshi\\'s dad standing next\\nto mine, beaming. He\\'s wearing a jacket from his construction company and an\\narmband that says Toshiki Miyamizu Supporter.\\nThe guy looks back at me, then at Tesshi, and continues. \"Their kids are all\\nbuddy-buddy, too.

There\\'s one train every\\ntwo hours, buses come through only twice each day, we don\\'t get weather\\nreports for our area, and we\\'re still a mosaic on the Google Maps satellite\\nphotos. The convenience store closes at nine, and it sells things like vegetable\\nseeds and high-grade farming equipment.\\nOn the way home from school, Saya and I are still in \"griping about\\nItomori\" mode.\\nThere are no big chains like McDonald\\'s or MOS Burger, but we have two\\nsleazy \"snackbars.\" There\\'s no work, no girls come here to find husbands, and\\nthe daylight hours are short. Gripe, gripe, gripe, gripe. Most of the time, we\\nactually find the town\\'s sparse population refreshing. We\\'re almost proud of it,\\nbut today we despair in earnest.\\nTesshi\\'s been pushing his bike along after us, off in his own world, and he\\nirritably cuts into the conversation.\\n\"Geez, y\\'all!\"\\n\"What?\" we ask crossly, and Tesshi gives a creepy grin.\\n\"Forget about all that stuff. Wanna stop at the cafe?\"\\n\"Huh...?\"\\n\"Wha...?\"\\n\"Wha...?!\"\\n\"A cafe?!\" we chorus in perfect unison.\\nA metallic kachonk! melts into the calls of the evening cicadas. \"Here.\"\\nTesshi holds out the cans of juice from the vending machine. With a motorized\\nwhine, an old man riding his electric scooter home from the fields crosses in\\nfront of us, and a passing stray dog sits down and yawns as if to say, Yeah, why\\nnot? I\\'ll keep you company.\\nThe \"cafe\" wasn\\'t exactly what springs to mind. It wasn\\'t Starbucks or\\nTully\\'s or one of those fantastic, fabled spaces that serves pancakes and bagels\\nand gelato. It was just a neighborhood bus stop out in the middle of nowhere\\nwith a vending machine and a bench with an ice-cream sign from about thirty\\nyears ago plastered to it. The three of us sit side by side on the bench, sipping\\nour juice, while the dog rests at our feet. We don\\'t feel like Tesshi tricked us.\\nIt\\'s more like, Well, sure. What else would it be?\\n\"Okay, I\\'m headin\\' home.\"\\nI bid my farewells to the two of them after participating in an exchange I\\ncould not have cared less about— \"I think it\\'s about a degree cooler than it\\nwas yesterday. \" \"No, I think it\\'s a degree warmer\" —that lasted as long as it\\ntook to finish a can of juice.\\n\"Good luck tonight,\" says Saya.\\n\"We\\'ll come by and watch later,\" promises Tesshi.\\n\"You seriously don\\'t have to! Actually, don\\'t you dare!\" I warn them, but\\ninside, I\\'m sending a prayer in their direction. Do your best to turn into an\\nactual couple, you two! After climbing the stone steps for a while, I turn back,\\nlooking at the pair of them as they sit on the bench with the sunset-colored lake\\nin the background, and I softly layer a lyrical piano melody over the scene.\\nMm-hmm, y\\'all really do look good together. Tonight, I must perform my awful\\nduty, but I hope you can enjoy your youth.\\n\"Awww, I wanna do it, too,\" Yotsuha grumbles.\\n\"It\\'s too soon for you yet, Yotsuha,\" hushes Gran.\\nThe constant click of spherical weights knocking together echoes in a\\nworkroom big enough for only about eight tatami mats. \"Listen to the voice of\\nthe thread,\" Gran tells her. Even as she speaks, her hands don\\'t pause in their\\nwork. \"If you keep windin\\' threads that way, before long, emotions will start\\nrunnin\\' between you and the thread.\"\\n\"Huh? But thread doesn\\'t talk.\"\\n\"Our braided cords—,\" Gran continues, ignoring Yotsuha\\'s objection. All\\nthree of us are wearing kimonos, and we\\'re finishing up the cords that we\\'ll\\nuse in tonight\\'s ceremony.\\nBraided cords are made of thin threads plaited together into a single rope.\\nIt\\'s a traditional folk art that\\'s been handed down for a very long time. The\\nfinished cords are cute and colorful, with all sorts of designs braided into\\nthem. That said, the work takes quite a bit of skill, so Gran\\'s making Yotsuha\\'s\\nfor her. Yotsuha\\'s spending the time doing assistant work, winding thread\\naround the ball-weights.\\n\"Our braided cords hold a thousand years of Itomori\\'s history. I tell you,\\nthat school of yours really should put priority on teachin\\' this sort of town\\nhistory to you children. Listen, two hundred years ago...\"\\nHere we go again, I think with a wry little smile. It\\'s Gran\\'s favorite\\nspeech, and I\\'ve heard it over and over in this workroom, ever since I was\\nsmall.\\n\"A fire began in the bathroom of Mayugorou Yamazaki, the straw sandal-\\nmaker, and it burned up this whole area, including the shrine and all the old\\nrecords. It was what people call—\"\\nGran glances at me.\\n\"\\'The Great Mayugorou Fire,\"\\' I answer smoothly.\\nMm-hmm. Gran nods, looking satisfied.\\n\"What? They named the fire after him?!\" Yotsuha exclaims, startled. \"Poor\\nMr. Mayugorou,\" she mutters. \"Havin\\' his name stick around \\'cause of\\nsomethin\\' like that.\"\\n\"Thanks to that fire, we don\\'t know what our dances or the patterns in our\\ncords mean anymore. All we have left are the forms. Still, even not knowin\\',\\nwe mustn\\'t ever let the forms disappear. The meanin\\' in those shapes is bound\\nto resurface someday.\"\\nGran\\'s words have a unique rhythm to them, like a traditional ballad, and as\\nI braid my cord, I mouth the words along with her, silently reciting them from\\nmemory. The meanin \\' in those shapes is bound to resurface someday. Here,\\nat Miyamizu Shrine —\\n\"Here, at Miyamizu Shrine, that\\'s our solemn duty. And yet...\"\\nAt that point, Gran lowers her mild eyes, sadly.\\n\"And yet, that foolish son of mine... As if abandonin\\' the priesthood and\\nleavin\\' this house weren\\'t enough, he had to become a politician...\"\\nGran sighs, and I sneak a small sigh of my own underneath it. Even I don\\'t\\nreally know whether I love this town or hate it, whether I want to go\\nsomewhere far away or stay with my family and friends forever.

       "   'text': 'darkness would probably terrify city folks. It sets the mood for some sinister\\nevent, like in an old murder mystery novel. For a little while now, I\\'ve been\\nperforming a ceremonial shrine maiden dance, feeling gloomy enough that I\\nwish a killer like Jason or Jack the Ripper—anybody really—would just put\\nme out of my misery.\\nThis time every year, the Miyamizu Shrine holds its harvest festival, and\\nYotsuha and I have the misfortune of being the stars of the show. On this day,\\nwe wear crisp shrine maiden outfits, paint on bright-red lip rouge and wear\\njingly hair ornaments, go out in front of the standing audience at the kagura\\nhall, and dance the dance Gran taught us. It\\'s one of the traditions whose\\nmeaning was lost in the fire, and it\\'s performed by two people, moving in sync.\\nWe\\'re both holding bells with colorful cords tied to them. We ring them,\\ntwirling around and around, making the cords flare out and trail behind us.\\nDuring my last spin, I spotted Tesshi and Saya out of the corner of my eye and\\ngot even more depressed. Those little— I told them and told them not to come,\\nand they\\'re still here?! I\\'ll hex them with my shrine maiden power! I\\'ll text\\nthem tons of curse stamps with Line! That said, the dance isn\\'t the part I hate.\\nSure, it\\'s a little embarrassing, but since I\\'ve been doing it since I was little,\\nI\\'m completely used to it. No, it\\'s not this. It\\'s that one ritual. The one that\\'s\\nmore embarrassing the older I get. That thing I have to do right after this. The\\npart that seems intentionally designed to brutally humiliate women.\\nOh, for the love of—\\nI don\\'t wanna!\\nPlagued by these thoughts, I move my body, and then all of a sudden, the\\ndance ends. Agh. Here it comes.\\nMunch, munch, munch.\\nMunch.\\nMunch, munch, munch, munch.\\nI\\'m intently chewing rice. I shut my eyes and keep chewing, trying not to\\nthink, trying not to sense flavor or sound or color. Beside me, Yotsuha\\'s doing\\nthe exact same thing. We\\'re kneeling formally, side by side, and a small\\nwooden box rests on a stand in front of each of us. And of course, beyond that,\\na diverse audience of all ages and genders stares at us.\\nMunch, munch, munch.\\nMunch, munch.\\nAgh, I swear...\\nMunch, munch, munch.\\nI\\'m going to have to do it soon.\\nMunch, munch.\\nArrrgh.\\nMunch.\\nGiving up, I raise the box in front of me. I bring it close to my lips,\\nattempting to veil my mouth with the sleeve of my kimono.\\nAnd then. Aaagh.\\nPuckering my lips, I spit the rice I\\'ve been chewing into the box. The\\nmixture of grain and saliva dribbles from my mouth as a thick, white liquid. I\\nfeel as if I\\'ve heard the crowd stir, muttering. Waaaaaaaaah! I sob internally.\\nPlease, nobody look at me.\\nMouth-brewed sake.\\nIt\\'s the oldest type of sake in Japan. If you chew up rice, mixing it with\\nsaliva, then just let it sit, it ferments and turns into alcohol. Then it\\'s offered to\\nthe gods. Long ago, I hear places all over the country used to make it, but I\\ndon\\'t know if any other shrines still do this sort of thing now, in the twenty-first\\ncentury... And seriously, doing it in shrine maiden clothes is just over the top!\\nI mean, what\\'s the point?! Mentally sniffling, I pick up another pinch of rice\\nand put it in my mouth like a trooper. Then I chew again. Yotsuha is doing the\\nexact same thing, her expression cool and composed. We have to do this over\\nand over until the tiny boxes are full. Dribble... I spit saliva and rice again.\\nInside, I\\'m crying my eyes out.\\nAbruptly, my ears catch familiar voices. Feeling a bad premonition like a\\nfaint ripple, I raise my eyes ever so slightly.\\nCurses.\\nI want to explode and take the shrine with me. I knew it: It\\'s my three flashy\\n\"in-crowd\" classmates. They\\'re watching me with smirks on their faces and\\ngleefully gossiping about something. There\\'s too much distance between us for\\nme to really hear them but I feel as though I\\'m hearing them loud and clear.\\nEeeeee, I could never, ever do that! and That s kinda obscene, and Man, how\\ncan she do that in public? Nobody\\'s ever gonna marry her now.\\nI make a very, very firm resolution:\\nWhen I graduate, I am leaving this town and going far away.',\n",

And\\nanyway, what\\'s got you so shook up?\"\\n\"It must be nice being a carefree, prepubescent little kid!\"\\nI glare at Yotsuha. We\\'ve changed into T-shirts and just left the shrine office\\nentrance.\\nAfter the harvest festival, to close out the night, the two of us attended a\\nbanquet for the local men and women who helped with the festival. Gran was\\nthe hostess, and Yotsuha and I poured sake and made conversation.\\n\"How old are you now, li\\'l Mitsuha? What?! Seventeen?! I see... Havin\\'a\\nsweet young thing like you pour for me makes me feel young again. \"\\n\"Yessir, go on and roll the years way back! Here, go ahead—drink some\\nmore!\"\\nWe entertained almost desperately, wore ourselves out, and they finally\\nturned us loose just now, saying, \"You kids can go on home.\" Gran and the\\nother adults are still at the shrine office, carrying on with the banquet.\\n\"Yotsuha, do you know what the average age was back there, in the office?\"\\nOn the grounds, all the lights on the shrine approach are out, and the cool\\nsounds of insect songs echo all around us.\\n\"I dunno. Sixty?\"\\n\"I did the math in the kitchen. It was seventy-eight. Seventy-eight!\"\\n\"Huh.\"\\n\"Now that we\\'re gone, it\\'s ninety-one in there! They\\'re pushin\\' a hundred.\\nThey\\'re in the final stage of life. The underworld might send a reaper for the\\nwhole place!\"\\n\"Hmm...\"\\nWhat I\\'m trying to get at is that we should bail on this town ASAP, but\\nYotsuha\\'s response is terse. She seems preoccupied with something else. Well,\\nshe\\'s just a little kid. She wouldn\\'t understand her big sister\\'s agony. Giving\\nup, I look at the sky. The vast expanse of it is filled with dazzling bright stars,\\nshining transcendentally, as if human lives on Earth are none of their concern.\\n\"...That\\'s it!\"\\nAs we descend the shrine\\'s long stone stairway, side by side, Yotsuha\\nsuddenly cries out. She\\'s wearing a triumphant expression, as if having found a\\ncake someone hid from her.\\n\"Sis, why don\\'t you chew up a whole bunch of that sake and use it to pay\\nyour way to Tokyo?!\"\\nFor a moment, I\\'m speechless.\\n\".. .You\\'ve got quite the mind to come up with that.\"\\n\"You could send snapshots and \\'makin\\' of\\' documentary videos with it and\\ncall it \\'Shrine Maiden Sake\\' or somethin\\'! I bet that\\'d sell!\"\\nShould I be worried that my nine-year-old sister sees the world like that?\\nStill, I realize Yotsuha is actually concerned about me, in her own way. Aw, she\\nreally is cute, I think, a little more fondly than before. Okay then, maybe I\\'ll\\ngive this sake business idea some serious thought... Wait, can you just sell\\nsake on your own like that?\\n\"Well? What do you think, Sis?\"\\n\"Hmm...\"\\n.. .And that\\'s all I have to say.\\n\".. .Wait, no! It\\'d be against the liquor laws!\"\\nWait, was that the problem? I wonder, and when I come back to myself,\\nI\\'ve broken into a run. All sorts of incidents and feelings and prospects and\\ndoubts and despairs are jumbled together inside me, and it feels like my heart\\'s\\nabout to explode. I run down the steps, taking them two at a time, slam on the\\nbrakes under the torii gate on the landing, and suck in a huge lungful of chilly\\nnight air. Then I expel the cluttered mess in my chest along with it.\\n\"I\\'m sick of this town! I\\'m sick of this life! Make me a hot guy in Tokyo in\\nmy next life, puhleeeease!\"\\nEeease. Eeease. Eeease. Eeease...\\nMy wish echoes around the dark mountains, then disappears as though\\ndrawn into Itomori Lake below me. The words came out on impulse, and\\nthey\\'re so dumb, my head cools right down, as does my sweat.\\nOh, but even so.\\nGods, if you\\'re really there...\\nPlease—\\nEven if the gods really do exist, I still don\\'t know what to wish for.',\n",

       "   'text': 'little while now, Fve been trying—and failing—to find an opportunity to speak\\nto her. Her long hair has a soft wave to it. From the side, it hides her eyes, and\\nI can\\'t read her expression. Still, her lustrous, glossy lips are curved into a\\ngentle smile. Her arms and legs are slender, and her waist is very small—and\\nyet she\\'s got big boobs. She\\'s just incredibly cool somehow. Passing her, I\\ncatch a glimpse of the name tag on that proud bosom. It reads Okudera.\\nPerfect!\\n\"Miss Okudera?\"\\nJust as I take the plunge and speak, somebody pokes me in the back of the\\nhead.\\n\"That\\'s senpai to you!\" The guy who poked me sounds like he\\'s joking. He\\ngoes back into the kitchen, a stack of menus in one hand. I see, so she\\'s got\\nseniority on me. Okay!\\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai! That was really...\"\\n\"Taki. You had a rough day today, didn\\'t you?\"\\nAs she speaks, she turns and looks me right in the eye. Her long eyelashes\\ncurve toward the ceiling, her perfectly shaped almond eyes are the epitome of\\nbeauty, and her sexy voice sends a tickle down my back. I instinctively feel\\ncompelled to tell her I love you! My cheeks flush a little, and I hastily look\\ndown.\\n\"Uh, no, it wasn\\'t really \\'rough,\\' just...\"\\n\"That guy was totally full of it. I handled it according to the manual and let\\nhim have his food for free, but...\"\\nShe doesn\\'t seem all that angry. She flips the rag over and starts wiping\\ndown another table. Just as I\\'m about to try to prolong the conversation...\\n\"Eek! Okudera-senpai!\"\\nAnother waitress cries out.\\n\"Your skirt!\"\\n\"Hmm?\"\\nMiss Okudera twists to inspect her rear, and her face rapidly flushes. Now\\nthat I\\'m looking, I can see a rough, horizontal slash just above her thigh. With a\\nshocked little shriek, she pulls her apron around to hide the tear.\\n\"Are you hurt?\"\\n\"Geez! Nasty. Was it that one dude?\"\\n\"I think something like that\\'s happened before...\"\\n\"Was someone harassing you?\"\\n\"Do you remember the guy\\'s face?\"\\nSeveral staff members gather around Okudera-senpai, chattering worriedly.\\nEyes downcast, she\\'s gone very still. I stand motionless, like an idiot, with the\\nwords I\\'d prepared still on my tongue. Her shoulders tremble slightly. I think I\\nsee little tears welling up at the corners of her eyes.\\nThis time, I need to rescue her.\\nThe thought seems to burst inside me, and before I know what I\\'m doing,\\nI\\'ve grabbed Okudera-senpai\\'s hand and started walking. I hear voices at my\\nback (\"Hey! Taki, you little...\"), but I ignore them.\\nThe green can be a field. The orange is flowers and butterflies. I want at\\nleast one more design element. The brown is— Sure, it\\'ll be a hedgehog. The\\ncream is for its nose.\\nPinching the edges of the tear in the skirt, I deftly whipstitch it together. For\\nsome reason, there were several colors of embroidery thread in the changing\\nroom sewing kit, so I\\'m taking the opportunity to make this a bit of an elaborate\\nrepair job. Gran trained me in needlework, and it\\'s something I\\'m particularly\\ngood at.\\n\"All done!\"\\nI hand the skirt to Miss Okudera. It\\'s only taken me about five minutes to\\nfinish.\\n\"...Huh? This is...\"\\nThe dubious expression she\\'s worn since I dragged her to the dressing\\nroom quickly shifts to surprise.\\n\"This is amazing! Taki, wow! It\\'s even cuter than it was before!\"\\nThe tear in the skirt was a straight, horizontal line about six inches long, so\\nas I stitched it together, I turned it into a scene of a hedgehog playing in a field.\\nThe skirt is dark brown, so the little decoration acts as an accent, my thought\\nbeing a cute motif would look especially good on a sophisticated beauty like\\nOkudera-senpai. She has an even-featured, gorgeous, magazine-model face, but\\nwhen she smiles, she\\'s more approachable, like an older girl from the\\nneighborhood.\\n\"You really saved me today. Thank you very much.\"\\nI finally managed to say it.\\n\"Heh-heh!\" Okudera-senpai\\'s large eyes narrow softly when she smiles.\\n\"To tell you the truth, I was a little worried back there. You\\'re weak, Taki, but\\nyou\\'re always so quick to fight.\"\\nAs she speaks, her slim fingers lightly tap her left cheek. Oh. Vaguely, I\\ngrasp the reason for the bandage on Taki Tachibana\\'s face.\\n\"I like this version of you better,\" Okudera-senpai says, a bit\\nmischievously. \"You\\'re surprisingly in touch with your feminine side, Taki.\"\\nMy heart leaps with a bo-yo-yoing. Her smile is absolutely unbeatable. It',\n",

Almost every ten\\nsteps, the aromas change.

My heart is strangely stirred by the ranks of buildings that\\nstretch as far as the eye can see, by their dizzying numbers and the\\noverwhelming weight of them, almost like a mountain range.\\nTaki Tachibana is one of the residents here, too. Softly, I extend a hand\\ntoward the boy reflected in the train window. His face annoyed me a little, but\\nI guess I don\\'t hate it. I\\'m starting to feel a sense of camaraderie with this guy,\\nas if he\\'s a fellow soldier who endured this rough day with me.

In the next, she\\'s noticed and turned to face the\\ncamera, beaming and flashing a peace sign.\\n...Maybe he likes Okudera-senpai , I think out of nowhere. It\\'s bound to be\\nunrequited, though. She\\'s in college. To her, high school guys are still just kids.\\nI sit up on the bed and create an entry in his diary app. Then I start typing in\\neverything I experienced today. About how I made a lot of mistakes but\\nconnected with Okudera-senpai at the end. About how, on the way home from\\nwork, we walked from the restaurant to the station together. I capture all of it in\\nthe entry, wanting to report it—or brag about it—to Taki Tachibana. Once I\\'m\\ndone, I yawn again. Then, out of nowhere...\\nWho are you?\\nFor some reason, I remember the line scribbled in my Japanese notebook.\\nVaguely, I can picture Taki Tachibana in my body, writing that note in my room\\nin Itomori before he falls asleep. What a bizarre idea. Still, there\\'s something\\noddly persuasive about it. I take a felt-tip marker from the desk, and on the\\npalm of my hand, I write:\\nMitsuha\\nYaaaawwn...\\nThat\\'s the third yawn. Unsurprisingly, today wore me out. It was a colorful,\\nthrilling day. It feels as if I spent all of it getting pelted by a rainbow-colored\\nshower. Even without background music, this world dazzled me from start to\\nfinish. I imagine how startled Taki Tachibana\\'s going to react when he sees the\\nwriting on his hand, and, smiling a little, I fall asleep.',\n",

No, that\\'s not it. I hope\\nthat\\'s not it. It\\'s all Mitsuha\\'s fault for throwing me into this situation\\nunprepared. And more than anything, it\\'s Okudera-senpai\\'s fault for being too\\npretty.\\nI mean, everybody we pass stares at her with their mouths hanging open.\\nThen they see me walking beside her and give me the stink-eye, like they\\'re\\nthinking, What\\'s that little punk doing there? That\\'s what it looks like to me,\\nanyway.\\nWell, sure. Even I know I\\'m out of my league. Look, I didn\\'t ask her out! I\\nwant to go around grabbing people\\'s shoulders and making excuses for myself.\\nConsequently, I have absolutely no idea what to talk about. Okudera-senpai can\\ntell and tries starting conversations with me, but that makes me insanely\\nuncomfortable, which makes it even harder to talk. It\\'s a vicious cycle.\\nDammit, Mitsuha, what do you and Okudera-senpai usually talk about?!\\nHoping for a lifeline, I open my phone and check Mitsuha\\'s memo.\\n...That said, I bet you\\'ve never been on a date before.\\nAnd so, below, I\\'ve put together a collection of handpicked\\nlinks, just for you!\\n\"Whoa, seriously?!\"\\nLook at that! She\\'s practically a god! I open the links as if clinging to them\\nfor dear life.\\nLink 1: How I gots me a girlfriend even tho I has a\\ncommunication disorder\\nLink 2: Conversation skills for the person who\\'s never, ever\\nbeen the tiniest bit popular!\\nLink 3: \\\\bu won\\'t make \\'em sick anymore! A feature on\\ntexts they\\'ll love\\n.. .Somehow I get the feeling she\\'s selling me way, way short.\\nWalking through the art museum, I\\'m finally feeling a little relieved.\\nI\\'m not particularly interested in the photo exhibit, which is titled\\nNostalgia, but it\\'s great to be somewhere it isn\\'t weird not to talk. Okudera-\\nsenpai is five feet ahead of me, strolling slowly, placidly gazing at the pictures.\\nFurano, Tsugaru, Sanriku, Rikuzen, Aizu, Shinshu... The exhibition is\\ndivided regionally, but all the rustic scenery looks the same to me. I don\\'t\\nknow the right way to appreciate photos, but about the only differences I can\\nmake out are whether the background is mountains or ocean and whether it\\'s\\nsummer or winter. The houses and train stations and roads and people all seem\\noddly similar. I guess rural Japan probably looks like this no matter where you\\ngo. In that case, the districts in Tokyo have a lot more personality. \"Shibuya\\nand Ikebukuro,\" for example, or \"Akasaka and Kichijouji,\" or \"Meguro and\\nTachikawa.\"\\nEven so, in the section labeled Hida, my feet stop all by themselves.\\nThis one is different from the others.\\nWell, no. The photos still look similar, but I know this place—the contours\\nof the mountains, the curve of the road, the size of the lake, the shape of the red\\nshrine gates, the layout of the fields. I just know, the way you can always pick\\nout your own shoes from a mess of scattered sneakers without even trying. I\\nnever actually went to visit relatives in the country during summer vacations\\nwhen I was a kid, but that\\'s what this feels like. I\\'m having a surreal, powerful\\nsense of deja vu about the place. This is—\\n\"Taki?\"\\nWhen I turn toward the voice, Okudera-senpai is standing beside me. For a\\nsecond, I forgot she existed.\\n\"You know, Taki,\" she says with an even smile, \"you seem like a different\\nperson today.\"\\nShe executes a beautiful turn, like a model, and strides away, leaving me\\nbehind.\\nI blew it.\\nAll I did today was trudge through the date Mitsuha planned like the whole\\nthing had been a chore. I just kept coming up with excuses and didn\\'t even\\nconsider what Okudera-senpai, who was right there with me, might be feeling.\\nEven though I (well, Mitsuha) was the one who\\'d invited her. Even though I\\nshould\\'ve been ecstatic just to get to spend time with her. Even though I\\'ve\\nspent my whole life hoping for a miraculous day exactly like this.\\nFrom the pedestrian bridge, I have a clear view of the cluster of Roppongi\\nbuildings we just left. Hundreds of windows shine golden in the evening sun.\\nMy eyes go back to Okudera-senpai ahead of me. She\\'s not saying a word.\\nHer hair gleams, and her hat and clothes look brand new. Today, at least,\\nshe might have gone to all that trouble just for me. The thought makes my throat\\ntighten. I feel like the oxygen\\'s suddenly thinned, and it\\'s hard to breathe. I\\ngrope for words as if desperately flailing for the surface of the ocean.\\n\"Um, Okudera-senpai?\"\\nShe doesn\\'t turn.\\n\".. .Are you hungry? We could go get dinner somewhere—\"\\n\"Why don\\'t we call it a day instead?\" she suggests with the tone of a patient\\nteacher.\\n\"Okay.\"\\nOn the spur of the moment, I say something really boneheaded. Okudera-\\nsenpai has finally turned around, but her expression, fading into the evening sun\\n—I can\\'t see it clearly.\\n\"Taki... Forgive me if I\\'m wrong, all right?\"\\n\"Sure.\"\\n\"A long time ago, you liked me a little bit, didn\\'t you?\"\\n\"Huh?!\" She knew?! How?!\\n\"And now there\\'s someone else you like, isn\\'t there?\"\\n\"Huuuuuuuh?!\" I gush sweat as if Fve suddenly teleported into a tropical\\nrain forest. \"N-no, there isn\\'t!\"\\n\"Really?\"\\n\"Th-there isn\\'t! There\\'s absolutely nobody like that!\"\\n\"I wonder...\"\\nOkudera-senpai examines my face skeptically. Somebody else I like? No,\\nthere\\'s nobody like that. Fm pretty sure there isn\\'t. Just for a moment, her long\\nhair and the softness of her breasts flicker through my mind but vanish almost\\nimmediately.\\n\"Well, never mind.\"\\nHer tone is bright and clear, and her face recedes.\\n\"Huh?\"\\n\"Thank you for today. I\\'ll see you at work.\"\\nOkudera-senpai flutters a hand at me, then simply walks away, leaving me\\nbehind. Mechanically, I open my mouth. Close it. Open it again. Even so, no\\nwords come out, and while I\\'m doing that, Okudera-senpai\\'s back descends\\nfrom the pedestrian bridge and disappears into the crowd in front of the station.\\nI gaze at the evening sun, feeling as if I\\'ve been abandoned on the edge of',\n",

No matter how much thought I gave it, I couldn\\'t figure out why.\\nAfter several weeks, it got harder to shake the suspicion they might just have\\nbeen a string of extremely vivid dreams.\\nI\\'ve got proof, though. I can\\'t believe that the journal entries Mitsuha left on\\nmy phone came out of my own head. That date with Okudera-senpai could\\nnever have happened if I\\'d been myself. I\\'m convinced Mitsuha\\'s a real girl.\\nHer body heat, her pulse, the way she breathes, her voice, the red light\\ndawning over her closed eyes, the vibrant sounds in her ears—I felt all of that\\nmyself. Experiencing her life was so intense, it convinced me, If she isn\\'t\\nalive, then nothing is. Mitsuha is real.\\nBecause of that, the abrupt way it ended is making me oddly uneasy.\\nSomething might have happened to her. Maybe she came down with a fever.\\nMaybe there was some sort of accident. Even if I\\'m overthinking things, at the\\nvery least, she\\'s bound to be worried about the situation, too. That\\'s why I\\ndecided to go see her in person. But...\\n. .Excuse me? You don\\'t actually know where she is?\"\\nWe\\'re in a four-person box seat on the express train Hida. Okudera-senpai\\nsounds incredulous, stuffing her face with a box lunch she picked up at the\\nstation.\\n\"...Right.\"\\n\"Your only clue is what the town looks like? You can\\'t even contact this\\ngirl? Are you kidding me?!\"\\nI didn\\'t ask her to come with me. How come I\\'m getting blamed? I look at\\nTsukasa, willing him to say something. He does, swallowing a bite of miso\\ncutlet.\\n\"You are an abysmal tour planner.\"\\n\"This isn\\'t a tour!\"\\nI lose it for a second. These two think they\\'re on some kind of field trip. I\\ncan read their expressions clearly. There\\'s just no help for this child. Why are\\nthey acting all superior, anyway?\\n\"Well, never mind,\" Okudera-senpai says. Unexpectedly, she smiles,\\nthrowing out her chest. \"Don\\'t you worry, Taki. We\\'ll help you look.\"\\n\"Eeeee, it\\'s so cuuuute! Taki, look at this, looook!\"\\nAt the local station we finally reached after noon, Okudera-senpai gushes\\nover the area\\'s laid-back mascot. It\\'s a full-body plush cow costume wearing a\\nstation employee cap. The camera on Tsukasa\\'s phone fires off click after click\\nin the little terminal.\\n\"You guys are in the way.\"\\nAs I glare at the local map posted in the station, I\\'m even more convinced\\nthat these two are going to be no help whatsoever. I\\'ll just have to find her\\nmyself.\\nThe plan goes like this:\\nSince I don\\'t know exactly where Mitsuha\\'s town is, we\\'ll take the train to\\na spot that seems close to the scenery in my memory. From that point, all we\\'ll\\nhave to go on will be the landscape sketches I drew.

It was a satellite on a grand scale; its super-long orbital period put\\nHalley\\'s Comet\\'s seventy-six to shame, and it had an orbital radius of 10.4\\nbillion miles. Not only that, but it was projected to pass within roughly\\nseventy-five thousand miles of Earth—closer than the moon. The tail of this\\nshining blue comet would stream across the dome of the night sky for the first\\ntime in twelve hundred years. The mood of the entire world was festive as it\\nwelcomed Comet Tiamat.\\nUntil the very moment it happened, no one anticipated that the comet\\'s\\nnucleus would split in Earth\\'s vicinity. Or that a rocky mass about 130 feet in\\ndiameter was buried in its icy core. The comet fragment became a meteorite,\\nplummeting to Earth at the devastating speed of almost twenty miles per\\nsecond. Tragically, it struck Japan—a residential area called Itomori.\\nThe town happened to be holding its autumn festival that day. The collision\\noccurred at 8:42 pm. The point of impact was near Miyamizu Shrine, which\\nmust have been lined with festival stalls and teeming with people.\\nThe meteorite instantly destroyed a wide area, centered on the shrine. The\\ndestruction wasn\\'t limited to houses and the forest. The impact gouged a huge\\nhole in the ground, forming a crater nearly half a mile across. One second later,\\nmagnitude 4.8 tremors rocked locations three miles away. Fifteen seconds\\nlater, the blast wind tore through, inflicting enormous damage on the greater\\npart of the town. The final death toll was more than five hundred, a third of the\\ntown\\'s population. Itomori became the site of the worst meteorite disaster in\\nhuman history.',\n",

He\\'s the one who took us to Itomori High\\nSchool yesterday, and to the city library. I called him really early this morning,\\nand he still did me a favor and brought the car over. If this hadn\\'t worked, I\\nwas planning to hitchhike, but I can\\'t imagine any cars would\\'ve given me a\\nride to a ruined, abandoned town. I\\'m seriously lucky I met this guy in Hida.\\nFrom the passenger-side window, I have a view down to the edge of New\\nItomori Lake. Half-demolished houses and broken asphalt languish in the\\nwater. Even a good ways offshore, I can see telephone poles and iron beams\\njutting out of the lake. It should be a very disconcerting sight, but I must have\\ngotten used to seeing it on TV and in photos, because I start feeling as if the\\nplace has always been like this. For that reason, I don\\'t really know how to\\nprocess what I\\'m seeing. Should I get mad, grieve, get scared, or lament my\\nown helplessness? The reality of losing an entire town is probably too much\\nfor ordinary people to get their heads around. I give up searching for meaning\\nin the scene and turn my eyes to the sky. Gray clouds hang over our heads, as if\\nthe gods have set an enormous lid there.\\nWe travel north along the lake, and when the car can\\'t go any higher, the\\nman sets the parking brake.\\n\"Looks like rain,\" he mutters, glancing up through the windshield. \"This\\nmountain ain\\'t real steep, but don\\'t push your luck. If anythin\\' happens, you call\\nus.\"\\n\"Yessir.\"\\n\"Also, here—\" He holds out a big lunch box to me. \"Eat this up top.\"\\nAutomatically, I accept it with both hands. It\\'s heavy.\\n\"Th-thank you very much...\"\\n.. .For everything. Seriously. Why would you do so much for me? Oh yeah,\\nand the ramen was super good. I can\\'t make any of the words come out the way\\nI want them to—all I manage is a tiny \"Thanks. Really.\" The guy smiles\\nslightly, takes out a cigarette, and lights up.\\n\"I dunno what\\'s goin\\' on with you,\" he says, exhaling smoke. \"But that\\npicture ofltomori you made. That was good.\"\\nThere\\'s a lump in my throat. Distant thunder rumbles softly.\\nI\\'m walking up a path to the shrine that\\'s as vague as a deer track.\\nSometimes I stop to check the destination I\\'ve marked on the map against\\nthe GPS on my phone. It\\'s all right—I\\'m getting closer. The surrounding\\nscenery looks sort of familiar, but I\\'ve climbed this mountain only once, in a\\ndream. I\\'m not very sure about it. That means, for now, all I can do is follow\\nthe map.\\nAfter I got out of the car, I bowed low and stayed that way until my ride\\nwas completely out of sight. As I did, I thought about Tsukasa and Okudera-\\nsenpai, too. In the end, this guy and those two came all the way out here\\nbecause they were worried about me. I must\\'ve looked really pathetic. I bet\\nthey thought I was about to cry the whole time. I was probably so aggressively\\ndistracted that, even if they wanted to ditch me, they couldn\\'t.\\nI can\\'t keep acting like that forever. I can\\'t keep taking advantage of the\\nhelp people offer me, I think firmly, gazing at New Itomori Lake through the\\ngaps in the trees.\\nSuddenly, a big raindrop hits my face. The leaves around me start to rustle\\nand shake. I pull up my hood and break into a run.\\nThe rain keeps falling, pouring down with enough force to carve the dirt\\naway.\\nThe temperature\\'s falling rapidly, absorbed by the rain. I can feel it on my\\nskin.\\nI eat my lunch in a little cave while waiting for the weather to let up. There\\nare three big rice balls the size of my fist and lots of side dishes. The thick-\\nsliced braised pork and bean sprouts stir-fried in sesame oil make it look like\\nsuch a stereotypical ramen-shop lunch that it\\'s funny. My body shakes with\\ncold, but as I eat, I gradually warm up again. Chewing the grains of rice and\\nswallowing, I can sense exactly where my throat and stomach are.\\nThis is musubi, I think.\\n\"Putting anything in your body, whether it\\'s water, rice, or sake, is also\\ncalled musubi. What you put in your body binds to your soul, you see. \"\\nThat day, I decided I\\'d remember those words even after I woke up. I say it\\naloud:\\n\"...They twist and tangle, sometimes come undone, and reunite. That\\'s\\nmusubi. That\\'s time.\"',\n",

Who was born, who\\'s having a funeral, that sort of thing?\"\\n\"Yeah. You can hear that all over town for sure, whether you\\'re inside or\\nout. If we send the order over that...!\"\\n\"Huh? But, uh...how? That comes from the town hall, doesn\\'t it? Would\\nthey let us broadcast stuff if we asked?\"\\n\"Pssh. No.\"\\n\"Then what do we do? Hijack Town Hall? I mean, I guess we\\'d have a\\nbetter shot at that than at taking over NHK, but...\"\\n\"Heh-heh-heh.\" With a creepy smile, Teshigawara types something into his\\nphone. Geez, this guy looks happy.\\n\"We can do this!\"\\nHe holds out his phone to me.\\nSuperimposed frequencies, it reads, and below is an explanation.\\n\"Wha...? Is this for real?\"\\nTeshigawara flares his nostrils and nods proudly.\\n\"Uh, Tesshi... Why do you even know stuff like this?\"\\n\"Well, I always fantasize before I fall asleep, y\\'know? About destroyin\\' the\\ntown, overthrowin\\' the school, stuff like that. Doesn\\'t everybody?\"\\n\"Huh...?\" That weirds me out a bit. But, no—this is...\\n\"This is awesome, Tesshi! It just might work!\"\\nWithout thinking, I throw an arm around Teshigawara\\'s shoulders.\\n\"H-hey, don\\'t get too close!\"\\n\"Huh?\"\\nWhoa. Even his ears are red.\\n\"What\\'s this? Tesshi, are you embarrassed?\"\\nI look up into Teshigawara\\'s face from below, grinning at him. Well, well,\\nMitsuha, you\\'re not to be taken lightly, are you? C\\'mon, c\\'mon! I press my\\nbody against him some more. Here you go—have a freebie! We\\'re sitting side\\nby side on an old sofa, and Tesshi\\'s already right by the wall, so he\\'s got\\nnowhere to run.\\n\"Hey, Mitsuha, cut it out!\"\\nTeshigawara resists, big body squirming. He\\'s a guy, for sure... Well, so\\nam I. Then, abruptly, Teshigawara jumps up, climbing onto the back of the sofa,\\nand yells, \"I told you, knock it off! A single girl your age—that ain\\'t proper!\"\\n\"Ha...\"\\nEven his buzzed scalp is red. He\\'s sweating bullets, and his eyes look\\nalmost teary.\\n\"Ha, ha-ha-ha! Tesshi, you\\'re such a...!\"\\nIn spite of myself, I crack up laughing.\\nHe\\'s a really good guy, and I\\'m positive I can count on him.\\nI thought of him as a friend before, but I\\'d like to meet him and the others\\nfor real and talk to them as a guy soon. Me and Mitsuha and Teshigawara and\\nSaya. If Tsukasa and Takagi and Okudera-senpai were there, too, I know it\\'d\\nbe a blast.\\n\"Sorry, Tesshi. I was just so happy you believed me...\" I\\'m biting back\\nlaughter, and Teshigawara\\'s sulking. \"Will you help me think up the rest of the\\nevacuation plan?\"\\nI smile at him Tesshi\\'s face is still red, but even so, he nods seriously.\\nOnce this is over, I\\'ll come see this guy, too, I think, feeling a little bit\\ndazzled.\\n\"A-a-a...a bomb?!\"\\nSaya yells. She\\'s eating a mini shortcake from a clear plastic wrapper.\\n\"Technically, they\\'re called water-gel explosives. They\\'re kinda like\\ndynamite,\" Teshigawara tells her, sounding proud. He\\'s crunching away on\\npotato chips, and I\\'m noshing on chocolate drops. Saya bought a ton of\\nconvenience-store food and spread it all over the desk, so it sort of feels like\\nwe\\'re having a party.\\nTeshigawara and I are standing behind a map, outlining our carefully\\nengineered evacuation plan to Saya. I almost want to play some energetic\\nmusic to set the stage. Something percussive and a bit unhinged—something\\nthat sounds like a strategy meeting.\\nTaking a gulp of coffee milk from a pint-size pack, Teshigawara continues.\\n\"There\\'s lots of explosives in my dad\\'s company\\'s warehouse, for construction\\nstuff. If I don\\'t have to worry about gettin\\' caught afterward, I can snatch as\\nmuch as we need.\"\\n\"Then, next,\" I say, opening a melon bread wrapper. I\\'m really hungry, and\\nfor some reason, everything I eat when I\\'m in Mitsuha\\'s body tastes really\\ngood.\\n\"Y-y-y.. .you\\'re gonna hijack the signal?!\" Saya\\'s voice cracks.\\nMunching on curry bread, Teshigawara explains. \"Rural wireless disaster\\nalert systems like ours are easy to take over, as long as you know the\\ntransmission frequency and the superimposed wake-up frequency. The\\nspeakers are made so they\\'ll activate as long as a specific frequency is layered\\nover the audio.\"\\nMelon bread in one hand, I pick up where he left off. \"That means we can\\nsend the evacuation order all over town from the school broadcasting room.\"\\nI point at the map of Itomori. There\\'s a circle with a diameter of a little less\\nthan a mile, centered on Miyamizu Shrine, and I trace its edge with my finger.\\n\"This is the area that\\'s supposed to take damage from the meteorite. As you\\ncan see, Itomori High is outside it.\" I tap on the location of the high school.\\n\"In other words, we just need to evacuate people here, to the schoolyard.\"\\n\"B-but that\\'s...\" Saya begins stammering nervously. \"That\\'s a full-blown\\ncrime!\"\\nEven as she says it, she\\'s putting the strawberry—which she saved for last\\n—in her mouth.\\n\"We\\'ll never get the people around here to move without committing a\\ncrime,\" I tell her coolly, sweeping away the chocolate drops I\\'d scattered over\\nthe map. That\\'s right. As long as it gets the people inside this circle to leave, it\\ndoesn\\'t matter whether it\\'s a crime or not.\\n\"Y\\'know, Mitsuha, it\\'s like you\\'re a different person.\"\\nI grin and take a big bite of melon bread. When I\\'m in this body, I\\nunconsciously start talking a bit like a girl, but I\\'ve completely abandoned\\ntrying to act like Mitsuha. As long as these guys are still safe when\\neverything\\'s over, nothing else matters. As long as we\\'re all alive, things will\\nwork out.\\n\"...So. You\\'re the one in charge of the broadcast, Saya,\" I tell her\\ncheerfully.\\n\"Why?!\"\\n\"Well, you\\'re in the broadcasting club, right?\"\\n\"Plus, your big sis is in charge of the Town Hall broadcast. Get her to tell\\nyou the wireless frequency,\" says Teshigawara.\\n\"Huh? I can\\'t just...\"\\nIgnoring Saya\\'s protest, Teshigawara happily points to himself. \"I\\'m the\\nexplosives guy!\"\\n\"And I\\'m going to go talk to the mayor,\" I say, pointing to myself.\\n\"Huh?!\" Saya is speechless, and Teshigawara picks up the explanation.\\n\"We can probably set up the evacuation on our own with the plan we just\\ntalked about. But if the town hall and firefighters don\\'t come out at the end,\\nthere\\'s no way we\\'ll get everybody in all one hundred eighty-eight families to\\nmove, y\\'know?\"',\n",

Since there were no schools along\\nthe track, everyone who commuted around here drove.\\n\\'Tmgoin\\' into Tokyo for a bit.\"\\nThis had been Mitsuha\\'s abrupt announcement to her little sister when they\\nleft the house that morning.\\n\"Huh?

Maybe it \\'ll be awkward.\\nOr maybe —\\nShe sees the words Comet Tiamat at Closest Point Tomorrow on a big\\noutdoor TV screen.\\nOr, if I do find him, just maybe, will he—?\\nTired from walking, she gazes at the sparkling lights of the buildings from a\\npedestrian bridge and thinks, almost praying:\\nIf I find Taki, maybe he \\'ll be just a little bit happy...\\nShe starts walking again, still thinking.\\nI\\'ll never find him searchin \\' randomly like this. I won\\'t, but I know one\\nthing for sure. If we meet, we \\'ll know right away. \"You \\'re the one who was in\\nme. I\\'m the one who was in you. \"\\nMitsuha\\'s certain of this, as if it\\'s as simple as two plus two.\\nThe evening sun sinks through the gap between the station platform roofs, as\\nweak as a dying flashlight.\\nMitsuha\\'s feet are sore from all the walking she\\'s done, and she plants\\nherself on a bench with her legs kicked out in front of her. She stares absently\\nat the setting sun, which is much paler and less reliable than in Itomori.\\nA musical chime plays, and a voice announces: \"The local train to...\\nChiba...is arriving on... Track Four. \" A yellow train glides onto the platform.\\nThe cars kick up a warm wind that ruffles her hair. Mitsuha gazes at the train\\nwindows without really seeing them.\\nAbruptly, her breath catches.\\nShe jumps to her feet as if she\\'s been stung.\\nHe \\'d been there, in the window that had just passed in front of her.\\nMitsuha breaks into a sprint. The cars have stopped, and she catches up to\\nthe window almost immediately. The evening train is crowded, though, and she\\ncan\\'t find him again from outside. With a sound like a giant exhalation, the\\ndoors open. The car\\'s so tightly packed that the people are practically spilling\\nout, making Mitsuha shiver. Even so—murmuring \"Excuse me\" and sweating\\nbehind the knees—she pushes her way into the crowd. With another giant sigh,\\nthe doors close. The train begins moving. Repeating \"Excuse me\" over and\\nover, little by little, Mitsuha works her way forward. Then, in front of one boy,\\nshe stops. The sounds around her vanish.\\nIt\\'s me. The middle school \"me\" from three years ago.\\n+ + +\\nI can\\'t go any higher on the bike.\\nNo sooner have I had the thought than the front wheel catches on a root, and\\nI slip.\\nOn reflex, I grab the trunk of a nearby tree. The bike slips out from under\\nme and tumbles down the slope, hitting the ground about ten feet below with a\\nhuge racket. The wheels are bent all out of shape. \"Sorry, Teshigawara,\" I\\nmutter softly, and I take off running up the narrow mountain track.\\nWhy did I forget? Why didn\\'t I remember until just now?\\nAs I run, I stare at the memories welling up inside me.\\nMitsuha, that day, three years ago, you came to see me—\\n+ +\\nTaki. Taki, Taki.\\nFor a while now, Mitsuha has been silently rolling my name around on her\\ntongue. I haven\\'t noticed her at all, even though I\\'m right in front of her. She\\nkeeps fretting over what tone she should use to address me and what\\nexpression she should wear, so earnestly she seems liable to burst into tears.\\nThen, forcing a bright smile, she says:\\n\"Taki.\"\\nThe middle school me is startled hearing my name out of the blue, and I\\nglance up. We\\'re still about the same height, so her big, vaguely teary eyes are\\nright in front of me.\\n\"Huh...?\"\\n\"Um, do you...\"\\nSmiling desperately, Mitsuha points to herself. I\\'m bewildered.\\n\"...Huh?\"\\n\"Don\\'t you remember me?\" asks this stranger, timidly, looking at me\\nthrough her lashes.\\n\"Who\\'re you?\"\\nMitsuha gives a small, breathy shriek, then quickly turns red. She lowers\\nher eyes, speaking in a voice that\\'s barely audible.\\n\"Oh... I\\'m sorry...\"\\nThe train sways. The passengers all adjust to keep their balance, except for\\nMitsuha, who staggers into me. Her hair brushes the tip of my nose, and I catch\\nthe faint scent of shampoo. \"I\\'m sorry,\" she mumbles again.\\nWeird girl , thinks middle school me.\\nMitsuha\\'s muddled mind races desperately. But you\\'re Taki, so why...? For\\nboth of us, time passes awkwardly.\\n\"The next station is ...Yotsuya. \" The announcement offers Mitsuha a bit of\\nrelief. At the same time, though, she feels unbearably sad. Still, she can\\'t stay\\nhere any longer. The doors open, and she moves with the rest of the crowd to\\nexit the train.\\nWatching her receding back, I suddenly think, Maybe this weird girl is\\nsomebody I should know. This inexplicable, intense impulse drives me to call\\nout.\\n\"\\'Scuse me! What\\'s your name?\"\\nMitsuha turns back, but the waves of disembarking passengers push her\\nfarther away. Hurriedly, she undoes the braided cord tying back her hair. She\\nholds it out to me and shouts:\\n\"Mitsuha!\"\\nWithout thinking, I reach for it. It\\'s a vivid orange, like a thin ray of evening\\nsun in the dim train. I shove my way into the crowd and grab that color tight.\\n\"My name is Mitsuha!\"\\n^ +\\nThat day, three years ago, you came to see me.\\nFinally, I know.\\nA girl I didn\\'t recognize spoke to me on the train once. To me, that was all\\nit\\'d been, and I completely forgot about it. But Mitsuha had come to Tokyo\\ncarrying the weight of all those feelings, had been hurt badly, gone back to her\\nown town, and cut her hair.',\n",

We set off,\\ngoing against the current of the university students on Shinjuku Street. We cut\\nacross Kioicho, then cross the Benkei Bridge. For the first time, I realize that\\nthe trees lining the roads are changing color. About half the people we pass\\nhave on lightweight coats. Okudera-senpai is wearing a loose ash-gray jacket,\\ntoo.\\n\"What\\'s going on today? Your text came out of the blue.\"\\nFeeling as if I\\'m the only one who hasn\\'t kept up with the season, I turn to\\nOkudera-senpai beside me.\\n\"What?\" Her glossy lips pout. \"I can\\'t get in touch with you without a\\nreason?\"\\n\"No, no, no!\" I wave my hands hastily.\\n\"You\\'re happy to see me, aren\\'t you? It\\'s been a long time.\"\\n\"Y-yes. I am.\"\\nShe smiles in satisfaction at my answer, then continues. \"I was in the area\\nfor work and thought I\\'d like to see your face, Taki.\" She was hired by a major\\nclothing chain and works at a branch store in Chiba now. \"Life in the suburbs\\nis fun, too, but Tokyo really is lively and one of a kind,\" she tells me, gazing at\\nher surroundings like she\\'s a little awestruck. \"Look,\" she says suddenly, and I\\nraise my head.\\nWe\\'re crossing a pedestrian bridge, so we\\'re eye level with the giant\\noutdoor display screen above an electronics store. It\\'s showing aerial footage\\nof gourd-shaped Itomori Lake and the words The Comet Disaster—Eight\\nYears Later in big letters.\\n\"We went to Itomori once, didn\\'t we?\" Okudera-senpai narrows her eyes,\\nas though she\\'s searching distant memories. \"You were still in high school,\\nTaki, so it must\\'ve been...\"\\n\"Five years ago, maybe?\" I finish the sentence for her.\\n\"That long...\" She exhales a little, as if surprised. \"I\\'m forgetting all sorts\\nof things.\"\\nShe\\'s right, I think. As we come down off the pedestrian bridge and walk\\nup Sotobori Street where it runs along the edge of the Akasaka Estate lands, I\\ntry remembering that day.\\nIt was the summer of my second year in high school— No, it was just about\\nthis time of year, early autumn. Tsukasa, Okudera-senpai, and I went on a short\\ntrip. We transferred from the Shinkansen to an express train, went all the way\\nto Gifu, and wandered aimlessly around the area along the local train line.\\nRight, and we went into this ramen shop that was standing all by itself on the\\nside of the national highway. And then... From that point on, my memories blur\\nand grow distant, as if belonging to a past life. Maybe we fought? I have a\\nvague recollection of leaving the other two and going off on my own. I climbed\\na mountain somewhere all alone, spent the night there, and then went back to\\nTokyo by myself the next day.\\nThat\\'s right... Back then, I was obsessed with the events surrounding that\\ncomet.\\nIn the sort of natural disaster that\\'s happened only a few times in human\\nhistory, a fragment of the comet destroyed a town. And yet, in spite of that,\\nalmost all the town\\'s residents survived. It was a miraculous night. The day the\\ncomet fell, Itomori just happened to be holding a town-wide disaster drill, and\\nmost of the locals had already been evacuated from the area impacted.\\nIt was such a huge coincidence and such incredible luck, that there were all\\nsorts of whispered rumors after the disaster. The unprecedented astronomical\\nphenomenon and the townspeople\\'s stupendous luck were enough to stir up the\\nmedia\\'s and public\\'s imagination. All sorts of irresponsible ideas flew around\\nwildly for days on end, from folklore-type stories that linked the comet\\'s visit\\nwith Itomori\\'s dragon-god legend, to political statements that either praised or\\nquestioned the mayor of Itomori\\'s use of plenary power in forcing an\\nevacuation, to occult rumors that the meteorite strike had actually been\\nforetold. Other strange details, such as the fact that the town had been so\\nisolated it was practically a landlocked desert island, and the fact that the\\npower across the entire area had gone out about two hours before the meteorite\\nstrike, spurred public speculation. Society\\'s excitement lasted until the\\nprograms to resettle the victims in other areas had calmed down a bit, but as\\nwith most incidents, just about the time the seasons changed, the topic of\\nItomori slowly disappeared from public conversation.\\nStill... Once again, it strikes me as strange. I\\'d even drawn sketches of\\nItomori, several of them. Not only that, but my feverish interest had\\nmaterialized unexpectedly, a few years after the comet strike. Something had\\nvisited me suddenly, like a delayed comet itself, then vanished without a trace.\\nWhat in the world had it been?\\nWell, I guess it\\'s not important , I think, watching the streets of Yotsuya sink\\ninto the dusk from a hill beside Sotobori Street. It really doesn\\'t matter now. I\\nwrite the thought on a wall in my mind. I need to be focusing on finding a job\\nnext year, not ancient history I don\\'t really remember.\\n\"The wind\\'s come up,\" Okudera-senpai whispers, and her long, wavy hair\\nrises softly. A sweet scent I smelled once, somewhere long ago and far away,\\nreaches my nose faintly. Like a conditioned reflex, the fragrance sparks a\\nmelancholy inside me.\\n\"Thanks for spending the day with me. This is far enough,\" Okudera-senpai\\nsays when I offer to see her to the turnstile at the station.',\n",

He's looking straight at me, and his eyes are\\nwide with surprise, like mine. Then I realize what the wish I've carried for so\\nlong really is.\\nShe's there, just a few feet away. I don't even know her name, but I know\\nit's her. Our trains are pulling away from each other. Then another train passes\\nbetween us, and I lose sight of her.\\nBut I finally know what I'm wishing for.\\nI wanted to stay with her, just a little longer.\\nI want to be with him, just a little more.\\nThe train stops, and I dash through the streets. I'm looking for her. I'm already\\npositive she's looking for me, too.\\nWe've met before. Or, no, that could be my imagination. It might be just an\\nassumption, something like a dream. It might be a delusion, like past lives.\\nEven so, I—we—wanted to stay together a little longer. We want to be\\ntogether, just a little more.\\nAs I run along the sloping road, I wonder, Why am I running? Why am 1\\nsearching? I probably know the answer. I don't remember it, but everything in\\nmy body knows. I turn at a narrow alley, and the road drops off. Stairs. I walk\\nover to them, look down.. .and there he is.\\nFighting back the urge to run, I climb the stairs slowly. A wind that smells\\nlike flowers lifts my suit jacket and fills it out into a bell. She's standing at the\\ntop of the stairs, but I can't look at her directly. I only watch her out of the\\ncorner of my eye. She's descending the stairs. The click of her shoes drifts\\nsoftly into the spring air. My heart is leaping in my rib cage.\\nAs we approach each other, we keep our eyes downcast. He doesn't say\\nanything. I can't say anything, either. Then, still without speaking, we pass each\\nother. In that moment, I feel a tense, squeezing pain all over, as though\\nsomething inside me has taken hold of my heart. This is wrong, I think fiercely.\\nWe can't possibly be strangers. It goes against something as basic as the\\nmechanics of the universe, or the laws of life. And so...\\nAnd so I turn around. She turns, too, with the exact same speed. She's\\nstanding on the stairs, the streets of Tokyo behind her, her eyes wide and round.\\nI realize her long hair is tied back with a cord the color of the evening sun. My\\nwhole body trembles slightly.\\nI finally found him. We finally met. Just as I think I'll probably burst into\\ntears unless I do something, I realize I'm already crying. Seeing this, he smiles.\\nEven as I cry, I smile, too. The spring air carries with it all sorts of\\napprehension and anticipation, and I draw a deep breath.\\nThen we open our mouths at the same time.\\nLike children who've agreed to go on the count of three, we say together:\",\n",
